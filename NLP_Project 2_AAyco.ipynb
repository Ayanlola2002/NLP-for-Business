      "thirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio to\r\n",

      "tutor of Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and\r\n",

      "\n",
      "tyrannical intentions. Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli\r\n",

      "Opizi, the head of the Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Messer Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "holding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "his eminence. Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but\r\n",
      "\n",
      "afterwards he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to bring him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples\r\n",

      "men on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he\r\n",

      "\n",
      "was wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: “If that be\r\n",
      "\n",
      "a vice then you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our\r\n",

      "a house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio, and said to him:\r\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest\r\n",
      "\n",
      "into such places.” A friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo\r\n",

      "and was told: “Fool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which\r\n",
      "\n",

      "to be a philosopher: “You are like the dogs who always run after those\r\n",
      "\n",
      "who will give them the best to eat,” and was answered: “We are rather\r\n",
      "\n",
      "like the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest\r\n",
      "\n",
      "need of them.” Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much\r\n",
      "\n",
      "disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for\r\n",
      "\n",
      "cowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did not fear\r\n",
      "\n",
      "anything. Castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that, since\r\n",
      "\n",
      "every man valued his soul for what is was worth. Being asked by one\r\n",
      "\n",
      "what he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: “When thou goest to a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "banquet take care that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon\r\n",

      "another.” To a person who was boasting that he had read many things,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Castruccio said: “He knows better than to boast of remembering many\r\n",

      "intoxicated. Castruccio replied: “An ox does the same.” Castruccio was\r\n",

      "acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate relations, and being\r\n",
      "\n",
      "blamed by a friend who told him that it was undignified for him to be\r\n",
      "\n",
      "taken in by a woman, he said: “She has not taken me in, I have taken\r\n",

      "\n",
      "“Thou dost not spend as much as I do?” and being told that it was true,\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "disturbed by this, said to him: “I knew not where to spit in order to\r\n",

      "usual in one of his station, so he said: “He who is considered wise by\r\n",

      "\n",
      "favour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening to his plea\r\n",
      "\n",
      "threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by\r\n",

      "Castruccio, said: “Thou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast\r\n",

      "dangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he\r\n",

      "he has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on\r\n",

      "the following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a\r\n",

      "“That is true,” answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: “A\r\n",

      "\n",
      "was wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: “If that be\r\n",
      "\n",
      "a vice then you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our\r\n",
      "\n",
      "saints.” Passing through a street he saw a young man as he came out of\r\n",

      "a house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio, and said to him:\r\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest\r\n",
      "\n",
      "into such places.” A friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo\r\n",

      "and was told: “Fool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which\r\n",
      "\n",
      "gave so much trouble to fasten.” Castruccio said to one who professed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to be a philosopher: “You are like the dogs who always run after those\r\n",
      "\n",
      "who will give them the best to eat,” and was answered: “We are rather\r\n",
      "\n",
      "like the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest\r\n",
      "\n",
      "need of them.” Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much\r\n",
      "\n",
      "disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for\r\n",
      "\n",
      "cowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did not fear\r\n",
      "\n",
      "anything. Castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that, since\r\n",
      "\n",
      "every man valued his soul for what is was worth. Being asked by one\r\n",
      "\n",
      "what he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: “When thou goest to a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "banquet take care that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon\r\n",
      "\n",
      "another.” To a person who was boasting that he had read many things,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Castruccio said: “He knows better than to boast of remembering many\r\n",
      "\n",
      "things.” Someone bragged that he could drink much without becoming\r\n",
      "\n",
      "intoxicated. Castruccio replied: “An ox does the same.” Castruccio was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate relations, and being\r\n",
      "\n",
      "blamed by a friend who told him that it was undignified for him to be\r\n",
      "\n",
      "taken in by a woman, he said: “She has not taken me in, I have taken\r\n",
      "\n",
      "her.” Being also blamed for eating very dainty foods, he answered:\r\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou dost not spend as much as I do?” and being told that it was true,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he continued: “Then thou art more avaricious than I am gluttonous.”\r\n",

      "\n",
      "disturbed by this, said to him: “I knew not where to spit in order to\r\n",

      "usual in one of his station, so he said: “He who is considered wise by\r\n",

      "\n",
      "favour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening to his plea\r\n",
      "\n",
      "threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Castruccio, said: “Thou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thy ears in thy feet,” whereupon he obtained double the favour he had\r\n",

      "asked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy one,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled\r\n",
      "\n",
      "blindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous\r\n",
      "\n",
      "words, he said to him: “When you have another request to make, send\r\n",
      "\n",
      "someone else to make it.” Having been wearied by a similar man with a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "long oration who wound up by saying: “Perhaps I have fatigued you by\r\n",
      "\n",
      "speaking so long,” Castruccio said: “You have not, because I have not\r\n",
      "\n",
      "listened to a word you said.” He used to say of one who had been a\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "dangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he\r\n",

      "took the wives from their husbands. To an envious man who laughed, he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "said: “Do you laugh because you are successful or because another is\r\n",

      "unfortunate?” Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco\r\n",

      "Guinigi, one of his companions said to him: “What shall I give you if\r\n",

      "instrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done\r\n",
      "\n",
      "wrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived\r\n",

      "those men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused\r\n",

      "I say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary\n",

      "But the difficulties occur in a new principality . And firstly , if it be\n",
      "not entirely new , but is , as it were , a member of a state which , taken\n",
      "collectively , may be called composite , the changes arise chiefly from\n",
      "an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities ; for\n",
      "men change their rulers willingly , hoping to better themselves , and\n",
      "this hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules : wherein\n",
      "they are deceived , because they afterwards find by experience they have\n",
      "gone from bad to worse . This follows also on another natural and common\n",
      "necessity , which always causes a new prince to burden those who have\n",
      "submitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships\n",
      "which he must put upon his new acquisition .\n",
      "\n",
      "In this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in\n",
      "seizing that principality , and you are not able to keep those friends\n",
      "who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the\n",
      "way they expected , and you can not take strong measures against them ,\n",
      "feeling bound to them . For , although one may be very strong in armed\n",
      "forces , yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill\n",
      "of the natives .\n",
      "\n",
      "For these reasons Louis the Twelfth , King of France , quickly occupied\n",
      "Milan , and as quickly lost it ; and to turn him out the first time it\n",
      "only needed Lodovico ’ s own forces ; because those who had opened the\n",
      "gates to him , finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future\n",
      "benefit , would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince . It is\n",
      "very true that , after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time ,\n",
      "they are not so lightly lost afterwards , because the prince , with\n",
      "little reluctance , takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the\n",
      "delinquents , to clear out the suspects , and to strengthen himself in\n",
      "the weakest places . Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time\n",
      "it was enough for the Duke Lodovico [ 1 ] to raise insurrections on the\n",
      "borders ; but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to\n",
      "bring the whole world against him , and that his armies should be\n",
      "defeated and driven out of Italy ; which followed from the causes above\n",
      "mentioned .\n",
      "\n",
      "[ 1 ] Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro , a son of Francesco Sforza , who\n",
      "married Beatrice d ’ Este . He ruled over Milan from 1494 to 1500 , and\n",
      "died in 1510 .\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second\n",
      "time . The general reasons for the first have been discussed ; it remains\n",
      "to name those for the second , and to see what resources he had , and\n",
      "what any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself\n",
      "more securely in his acquisition than did the King of France .\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I say that those dominions which , when acquired , are added to an\n",
      "ancient state by him who acquires them , are either of the same country\n",
      "and language , or they are not . When they are , it is easier to hold\n",
      "them , especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government ;\n",
      "and to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of\n",
      "the prince who was ruling them ; because the two peoples , preserving in\n",
      "other things the old conditions , and not being unlike in customs , will\n",
      "live quietly together , as one has seen in Brittany , Burgundy , Gascony ,\n",
      "and Normandy , which have been bound to France for so long a time : and ,\n",
      "although there may be some difference in language , nevertheless the\n",
      "customs are alike , and the people will easily be able to get on amongst\n",
      "themselves . He who has annexed them , if he wishes to hold them , has\n",
      "only to bear in mind two considerations : the one , that the family of\n",
      "their former lord is extinguished ; the other , that neither their laws\n",
      "nor their taxes are altered , so that in a very short time they will\n",
      "become entirely one body with the old principality .\n",
      "\n",
      "But when states are acquired in a country differing in language ,\n",
      "customs , or laws , there are difficulties , and good fortune and great\n",
      "energy are needed to hold them , and one of the greatest and most real\n",
      "helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside\n",
      "there . This would make his position more secure and durable , as it has\n",
      "made that of the Turk in Greece , who , notwithstanding all the other\n",
      "measures taken by him for holding that state , if he had not settled\n",
      "there , would not have been able to keep it . Because , if one is on the\n",
      "spot , disorders are seen as they spring up , and one can quickly remedy\n",
      "them ; but if one is not at hand , they are heard of only when they are\n",
      "great , and then one can no longer remedy them . Besides this , the\n",
      "country is not pillaged by your officials ; the subjects are satisfied\n",
      "by prompt recourse to the prince ; thus , wishing to be good , they have\n",
      "more cause to love him , and wishing to be otherwise , to fear him . He\n",
      "who would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost\n",
      "caution ; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested\n",
      "from him with the greatest difficulty .\n",
      "\n",
      "The other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places ,\n",
      "which may be as keys to that state , for it is necessary either to do\n",
      "this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry . A\n",
      "prince does not spend much on colonies , for with little or no expense\n",
      "he can send them out and keep them there , and he offends a minority\n",
      "only of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them\n",
      "to the new inhabitants ; and those whom he offends , remaining poor and\n",
      "scattered , are never able to injure him ; whilst the rest being\n",
      "uninjured are easily kept quiet , and at the same time are anxious not\n",
      "to err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have\n",
      "been despoiled . In conclusion , I say that these colonies are not\n",
      "costly , they are more faithful , they injure less , and the injured , as\n",
      "has been said , being poor and scattered , can not hurt . Upon this , one\n",
      "has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed ,\n",
      "because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries , of more serious\n",
      "ones they can not ; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man\n",
      "ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge .\n",

      "because in all the country there is no one who is recognized as\n",

      "he hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the\n",

      "for the reasons given , can open the way into the state and render the\n",

      "But to come to those who , by their own ability and not through fortune ,\n",

      "and such like are the most excellent examples . And although one may not\n",
      "discuss Moses , he having been a mere executor of the will of God , yet\n",
      "he ought to be admired , if only for that favour which made him worthy\n",
      "to speak with God . But in considering Cyrus and others who have\n",
      "acquired or founded kingdoms , all will be found admirable ; and if their\n",
      "particular deeds and conduct shall be considered , they will not be\n",
      "found inferior to those of Moses , although he had so great a preceptor .\n",
      "And in examining their actions and lives one can not see that they owed\n",
      "anything to fortune beyond opportunity , which brought them the material\n",

      "opportunity their powers of mind would have been extinguished , and\n",
      "without those powers the opportunity would have come in vain .\n",

      "Israel in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians , in order that\n",
      "they should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of\n",
      "bondage . It was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba , and\n",
      "that he should be abandoned at his birth , in order that he should\n",

      "enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions , and\n",
      "lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new . This\n",
      "coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents , who have the laws on\n",
      "their side , and partly from the incredulity of men , who do not readily\n",
      "believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them .\n",
      "Thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the\n",
      "opportunity to attack they do it like partisans , whilst the others\n",

      "their enterprise , have they to use prayers or can they use force ? In\n",
      "the first instance they always succeed badly , and never compass\n",
      "anything ; but when they can rely on themselves and use force , then they\n",

      "conquered , and the unarmed ones have been destroyed . Besides the\n",
      "reasons mentioned , the nature of the people is variable , and whilst it\n",

      "many immediate and prospective difficulties . Firstly , he did not see\n",

      "Church ; and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke\n",
      "of Milan and the Venetians would not consent , because Faenza and Rimini\n",
      "were already under the protection of the Venetians . Besides this , he\n",
      "saw the arms of Italy , especially those by which he might have been\n",
      "assisted , in hands that would fear the aggrandizement of the Pope ,\n",
      "namely , the Orsini and the Colonnesi and their following . It behoved\n",
      "him , therefore , to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers ,\n",
      "so as to make himself securely master of part of their states . This was\n",
      "easy for him to do , because he found the Venetians , moved by other\n",
      "reasons , inclined to bring back the French into Italy ; he would not\n",
      "only not oppose this , but he would render it more easy by dissolving\n",
      "the former marriage of King Louis . Therefore the king came into Italy\n",
      "with the assistance of the Venetians and the consent of Alexander . He\n",
      "was no sooner in Milan than the Pope had soldiers from him for the\n",
      "attempt on the Romagna , which yielded to him on the reputation of the\n",
      "king . The duke , therefore , having acquired the Romagna and beaten the\n",
      "Colonnesi , while wishing to hold that and to advance further , was\n",
      "hindered by two things : the one , his forces did not appear loyal to\n",
      "him , the other , the goodwill of France : that is to say , he feared that\n",
      "the forces of the Orsini , which he was using , would not stand to him ,\n",
      "that not only might they hinder him from winning more , but might\n",
      "themselves seize what he had won , and that the king might also do the\n",
      "same . Of the Orsini he had a warning when , after taking Faenza and\n",
      "attacking Bologna , he saw them go very unwillingly to that attack . And\n",
      "as to the king , he learned his mind when he himself , after taking the\n",
      "Duchy of Urbino , attacked Tuscany , and the king made him desist from\n",

      "For the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in\n",

      "their rank , honouring them with office and command in such a way that\n",
      "in a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned\n",

      "rebellion at Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna , with endless\n",
      "dangers to the duke , all of which he overcame with the help of the\n",
      "French . Having restored his authority , not to leave it at risk by\n",
      "trusting either to the French or other outside forces , he had recourse\n",
      "to his wiles , and he knew so well how to conceal his mind that , by the\n",
      "mediation of Signor Pagolo—whom the duke did not fail to secure with\n",
      "all kinds of attention , giving him money , apparel , and horses—the\n",
      "Orsini were reconciled , so that their simplicity brought them into his\n",
      "power at Sinigalia . [ 3 ] Having exterminated the leaders , and turned\n",
      "their partisans into his friends , the duke laid sufficiently good\n",

      "full of robbery , quarrels , and every kind of violence ; and so , wishing\n",

      "that he would become odious , so he set up a court of judgment in the\n",

      "It was his intention to secure himself against them , and this he would\n",
      "have quickly accomplished had Alexander lived .\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was his line of action as to present affairs . But as to the future\n",
      "he had to fear , in the first place , that a new successor to the Church\n",
      "might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which\n",
      "Alexander had given him , so he decided to act in four ways . Firstly , by\n",
      "exterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled , so as\n",
      "to take away that pretext from the Pope . Secondly , by winning to\n",
      "himself all the gentlemen of Rome , so as to be able to curb the Pope\n",
      "with their aid , as has been observed . Thirdly , by converting the\n",
      "college more to himself . Fourthly , by acquiring so much power before\n",
      "the Pope should die that he could by his own measures resist the first\n",
      "shock . Of these four things , at the death of Alexander , he had\n",
      "accomplished three . For he had killed as many of the dispossessed lords\n",
      "as he could lay hands on , and few had escaped ; he had won over the\n",
      "Roman gentlemen , and he had the most numerous party in the college . And\n",
      "as to any fresh acquisition , he intended to become master of Tuscany ,\n",
      "for he already possessed Perugia and Piombino , and Pisa was under his\n",
      "protection . And as he had no longer to study France ( for the French\n",
      "were already driven out of the kingdom of Naples by the Spaniards , and\n",
      "in this way both were compelled to buy his goodwill ) , he pounced down\n",

      "CONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But coming to the other point—where a leading citizen becomes the\n",
      "prince of his country , not by wickedness or any intolerable violence ,\n",
      "but by the favour of his fellow citizens—this may be called a civil\n",
      "principality : nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain\n",
      "to it , but rather a happy shrewdness . I say then that such a\n",
      "principality is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the\n",
      "favour of the nobles . Because in all cities these two distinct parties\n",
      "are found , and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be\n",
      "ruled nor oppressed by the nobles , and the nobles wish to rule and\n",
      "oppress the people ; and from these two opposite desires there arises in\n",
      "cities one of three results , either a principality , self-government , or\n",
      "anarchy .\n",
      "\n",
      "A principality is created either by the people or by the nobles ,\n",
      "accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity ; for the\n",
      "nobles , seeing they can not withstand the people , begin to cry up the\n",
      "reputation of one of themselves , and they make him a prince , so that\n",
      "under his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions . The people ,\n",
      "finding they can not resist the nobles , also cry up the reputation of\n",
      "one of themselves , and make him a prince so as to be defended by his\n",
      "authority . He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles\n",
      "maintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the\n",
      "aid of the people , because the former finds himself with many around\n",
      "him who consider themselves his equals , and because of this he can\n",
      "neither rule nor manage them to his liking . But he who reaches\n",
      "sovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone , and has none around\n",
      "him , or few , who are not prepared to obey him .\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides this , one can not by fair dealing , and without injury to others ,\n",
      "satisfy the nobles , but you can satisfy the people , for their object is\n",
      "more righteous than that of the nobles , the latter wishing to oppress ,\n",
      "while the former only desire not to be oppressed . It is to be added\n",
      "also that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people ,\n",
      "because of there being too many , whilst from the nobles he can secure\n",
      "himself , as they are few in number . The worst that a prince may expect\n",
      "from a hostile people is to be abandoned by them ; but from hostile\n",
      "nobles he has not only to fear abandonment , but also that they will\n",
      "rise against him ; for they , being in these affairs more far-seeing and\n",
      "astute , always come forward in time to save themselves , and to obtain\n",
      "favours from him whom they expect to prevail . Further , the prince is\n",
      "compelled to live always with the same people , but he can do well\n",
      "without the same nobles , being able to make and unmake them daily , and\n",
      "to give or take away authority when it pleases him .\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore , to make this point clearer , I say that the nobles ought to\n",
      "be looked at mainly in two ways : that is to say , they either shape\n",
      "their course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune , or\n",
      "they do not . Those who so bind themselves , and are not rapacious , ought\n",
      "to be honoured and loved ; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt\n",
      "with in two ways ; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a\n",
      "natural want of courage , in which case you ought to make use of them ,\n",
      "especially of those who are of good counsel ; and thus , whilst in\n",
      "prosperity you honour them , in adversity you do not have to fear them .\n",
      "But when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves , it\n",
      "is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you ,\n",
      "and a prince ought to guard against such , and to fear them as if they\n",
      "were open enemies , because in adversity they always help to ruin him .\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore , one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people\n",
      "ought to keep them friendly , and this he can easily do seeing they only\n",
      "ask not to be oppressed by him . But one who , in opposition to the\n",
      "people , becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles , ought , above\n",
      "everything , to seek to win the people over to himself , and this he may\n",
      "easily do if he takes them under his protection . Because men , when they\n",
      "receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil , are bound more\n",
      "closely to their benefactor ; thus the people quickly become more\n",
      "devoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their\n",
      "favours ; and the prince can win their affections in many ways , but as\n",
      "these vary according to the circumstances one can not give fixed rules ,\n",
      "so I omit them ; but , I repeat , it is necessary for a prince to have the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A prince ought to have no other aim or thought , nor select anything\n",
      "else for his study , than war and its rules and discipline ; for this is\n",
      "the sole art that belongs to him who rules , and it is of such force\n",
      "that it not only upholds those who are born princes , but it often\n",
      "enables men to rise from a private station to that rank . And , on the\n",
      "contrary , it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than\n",
      "of arms they have lost their states . And the first cause of your losing\n",
      "it is to neglect this art ; and what enables you to acquire a state is\n",
      "to be master of the art . Francesco Sforza , through being martial , from\n",
      "a private person became Duke of Milan ; and the sons , through avoiding\n",
      "the hardships and troubles of arms , from dukes became private persons .\n",
      "For among other evils which being unarmed brings you , it causes you to\n",
      "be despised , and this is one of those ignominies against which a prince\n",
      "ought to guard himself , as is shown later on . Because there is nothing\n",
      "proportionate between the armed and the unarmed ; and it is not\n",
      "reasonable that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him\n",
      "who is unarmed , or that the unarmed man should be secure among armed\n",
      "servants . Because , there being in the one disdain and in the other\n",
      "suspicion , it is not possible for them to work well together . And\n",
      "therefore a prince who does not understand the art of war , over and\n",
      "above the other misfortunes already mentioned , can not be respected by\n",
      "his soldiers , nor can he rely on them . He ought never , therefore , to\n",
      "have out of his thoughts this subject of war , and in peace he should\n",
      "addict himself more to its exercise than in war ; this he can do in two\n",
      "ways , the one by action , the other by study .\n",
      "\n",
      "As regards action , he ought above all things to keep his men well\n",
      "organized and drilled , to follow incessantly the chase , by which he\n",
      "accustoms his body to hardships , and learns something of the nature of\n",
      "localities , and gets to find out how the mountains rise , how the\n",
      "valleys open out , how the plains lie , and to understand the nature of\n",
      "rivers and marshes , and in all this to take the greatest care . Which\n",
      "knowledge is useful in two ways . Firstly , he learns to know his\n",
      "country , and is better able to undertake its defence ; afterwards , by\n",
      "means of the knowledge and observation of that locality , he understands\n",
      "with ease any other which it may be necessary for him to study\n",
      "hereafter ; because the hills , valleys , and plains , and rivers and\n",
      "marshes that are , for instance , in Tuscany , have a certain resemblance\n",
      "to those of other countries , so that with a knowledge of the aspect of\n",
      "one country one can easily arrive at a knowledge of others . And the\n",

      "Commencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics , I\n",
      "say that it would be well to be reputed liberal . Nevertheless ,\n",
      "liberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation\n",
      "for it , injures you ; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should\n",
      "be exercised , it may not become known , and you will not avoid the\n",
      "reproach of its opposite . Therefore , any one wishing to maintain among\n",
      "men the name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of\n",
      "magnificence ; so that a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts\n",
      "all his property , and will be compelled in the end , if he wish to\n",
      "maintain the name of liberal , to unduly weigh down his people , and tax\n",
      "them , and do everything he can to get money . This will soon make him\n",
      "odious to his subjects , and becoming poor he will be little valued by\n",
      "any one ; thus , with his liberality , having offended many and rewarded\n",
      "few , he is affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by\n",
      "whatever may be the first danger ; recognizing this himself , and wishing\n",
      "to draw back from it , he runs at once into the reproach of being\n",
      "miserly .\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore , a prince , not being able to exercise this virtue of\n",
      "liberality in such a way that it is recognized , except to his cost , if\n",
      "he is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean , for in\n",
      "time he will come to be more considered than if liberal , seeing that\n",
      "with his economy his revenues are enough , that he can defend himself\n",
      "against all attacks , and is able to engage in enterprises without\n",
      "burdening his people ; thus it comes to pass that he exercises\n",
      "liberality towards all from whom he does not take , who are numberless ,\n",
      "and meanness towards those to whom he does not give , who are few .\n",
      "\n",
      "We have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have\n",
      "been considered mean ; the rest have failed . Pope Julius the Second was\n",
      "assisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality , yet he\n",
      "did not strive afterwards to keep it up , when he made war on the King\n",
      "of France ; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax\n",
      "on his subjects , for he supplied his additional expenses out of his\n",
      "long thriftiness . The present King of Spain would not have undertaken\n",
      "or conquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal . A\n",
      "prince , therefore , provided that he has not to rob his subjects , that\n",
      "he can defend himself , that he does not become poor and abject , that he\n",
      "is not forced to become rapacious , ought to hold of little account a\n",
      "reputation for being mean , for it is one of those vices which will\n",
      "enable him to govern .\n",
      "\n",
      "And if any one should say : Caesar obtained empire by liberality , and\n",
      "many others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal ,\n",
      "and by being considered so , I answer : Either you are a prince in fact ,\n",
      "or in a way to become one . In the first case this liberality is\n",
      "dangerous , in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal ;\n",
      "and Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome ;\n",
      "but if he had survived after becoming so , and had not moderated his\n",
      "expenses , he would have destroyed his government . And if any one should\n",
      "reply : Many have been princes , and have done great things with armies ,\n",
      "who have been considered very liberal , I reply : Either a prince spends\n",
      "that which is his own or his subjects ’ or else that of others . In the\n",
      "first case he ought to be sparing , in the second he ought not to\n",
      "neglect any opportunity for liberality . And to the prince who goes\n",
      "forth with his army , supporting it by pillage , sack , and extortion ,\n",
      "handling that which belongs to others , this liberality is necessary ,\n",
      "otherwise he would not be followed by soldiers . And of that which is\n",
      "neither yours nor your subjects ’ you can be a ready giver , as were\n",
      "Cyrus , Caesar , and Alexander ; because it does not take away your\n",
      "reputation if you squander that of others , but adds to it ; it is only\n",
      "squandering your own that injures you .\n",
      "\n",
      "And there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality , for even whilst\n",
      "you exercise it you lose the power to do so , and so become either poor\n",
      "or despised , or else , in avoiding poverty , rapacious and hated . And a\n",
      "prince should guard himself , above all things , against being despised\n",
      "and hated ; and liberality leads you to both . Therefore it is wiser to\n",

      "Every one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith , and\n",
      "to live with integrity and not with craft . Nevertheless our experience\n",
      "has been that those princes who have done great things have held good\n",
      "faith of little account , and have known how to circumvent the intellect\n",
      "of men by craft , and in the end have overcome those who have relied on\n",
      "their word . You must know there are two ways of contesting , [ 2 ] the one\n",
      "by the law , the other by force ; the first method is proper to men , the\n",
      "second to beasts ; but because the first is frequently not sufficient ,\n",
      "it is necessary to have recourse to the second . Therefore it is\n",
      "necessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast\n",
      "and the man . This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient\n",
      "writers , who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were\n",
      "given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse , who brought them up in his\n",
      "discipline ; which means solely that , as they had for a teacher one who\n",
      "was half beast and half man , so it is necessary for a prince to know\n",
      "how to make use of both natures , and that one without the other is not\n",
      "durable . A prince , therefore , being compelled knowingly to adopt the\n",
      "beast , ought to choose the fox and the lion ; because the lion can not\n",
      "defend himself against snares and the fox can not defend himself against\n",
      "wolves . Therefore , it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares\n",

      "and when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer . If\n",
      "men were entirely good this precept would not hold , but because they\n",
      "are bad , and will not keep faith with you , you too are not bound to\n",
      "observe it with them . Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince\n",

      "subjects , the other from without , on account of external powers . From\n",
      "the latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies ,\n",

      "commit every kind of iniquity against the people ; and all , except\n",
      "Severus , came to a bad end ; but in Severus there was so much valour\n",

      "Knowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian , he persuaded the army in\n",

      "praetorian soldiers ; and under this pretext , without appearing to\n",

      "before it was known that he had started . On his arrival at Rome , the\n",
      "Senate , through fear , elected him emperor and killed Julian . After this\n",
      "there remained for Severus , who wished to make himself master of the\n",
      "whole empire , two difficulties ; one in Asia , where Niger , head of the\n",
      "Asiatic army , had caused himself to be proclaimed emperor ; the other in\n",
      "the west where Albinus was , who also aspired to the throne . And as he\n",
      "considered it dangerous to declare himself hostile to both , he decided\n",
      "to attack Niger and to deceive Albinus . To the latter he wrote that ,\n",
      "being elected emperor by the Senate , he was willing to share that\n",
      "dignity with him and sent him the title of Caesar ; and , moreover , that\n",
      "the Senate had made Albinus his colleague ; which things were accepted\n",
      "by Albinus as true . But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger ,\n",

      "ingratitude he was compelled to punish him . Afterwards he sought him\n",

      "But his son Antoninus was a most eminent man , and had very excellent\n",

      "fatigue , a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries , which\n",
      "caused him to be beloved by the armies . Nevertheless , his ferocity and\n",
      "cruelties were so great and so unheard of that , after endless single\n",
      "murders , he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those\n",
      "of Alexandria . He became hated by the whole world , and also feared by\n",
      "those he had around him , to such an extent that he was murdered in the\n",
      "midst of his army by a centurion . And here it must be noted that\n",
      "such-like deaths , which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and\n",
      "desperate courage , can not be avoided by princes , because any one who\n",
      "does not fear to die can inflict them ; but a prince may fear them the\n",
      "less because they are very rare ; he has only to be careful not to do\n",
      "any grave injury to those whom he employs or has around him in the\n",
      "service of the state . Antoninus had not taken this care , but had\n",
      "contumeliously killed a brother of that centurion , whom also he daily\n",
      "threatened , yet retained in his bodyguard ; which , as it turned out , was\n",
      "a rash thing to do , and proved the emperor ’ s ruin .\n",
      "\n",
      "But let us come to Commodus , to whom it should have been very easy to\n",
      "hold the empire , for , being the son of Marcus , he had inherited it , and\n",
      "he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his\n",
      "people and soldiers ; but , being by nature cruel and brutal , he gave\n",
      "himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them , so that he\n",
      "might indulge his rapacity upon the people ; on the other hand , not\n",
      "maintaining his dignity , often descending to the theatre to compete\n",
      "with gladiators , and doing other vile things , little worthy of the\n",
      "imperial majesty , he fell into contempt with the soldiers , and being\n",
      "hated by one party and despised by the other , he was conspired against\n",
      "and was killed .\n",
      "\n",
      "It remains to discuss the character of Maximinus . He was a very warlike\n",
      "man , and the armies , being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander ,\n",
      "of whom I have already spoken , killed him and elected Maximinus to the\n",
      "throne . This he did not possess for long , for two things made him hated\n",
      "and despised ; the one , his having kept sheep in Thrace , which brought\n",
      "him into contempt ( it being well known to all , and considered a great\n",
      "indignity by every one ) , and the other , his having at the accession to\n",
      "his dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the\n",
      "imperial seat ; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity\n",
      "by having , through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire ,\n",
      "practised many cruelties , so that the whole world was moved to anger at\n",
      "the meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity . First Africa\n",
      "rebelled , then the Senate with all the people of Rome , and all Italy\n",
      "conspired against him , to which may be added his own army ; this latter ,\n",
      "besieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it , were\n",

      "I do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus , Macrinus , or Julian , who , being\n",
      "thoroughly contemptible , were quickly wiped out ; but I will bring this\n",
      "discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this\n",
      "difficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a far\n",
      "less degree , because , notwithstanding one has to give them some\n",
      "indulgence , that is soon done ; none of these princes have armies that\n",
      "are veterans in the governance and administration of provinces , as were\n",
      "the armies of the Roman Empire ; and whereas it was then more necessary\n",
      "to give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people , it is now more\n",
      "necessary to all princes , except the Turk and the Soldan , to satisfy\n",
      "the people rather the soldiers , because the people are the more\n",
      "powerful .\n",
      "\n",
      "From the above I have excepted the Turk , who always keeps round him\n",
      "twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend\n",
      "the security and strength of the kingdom , and it is necessary that ,\n",
      "putting aside every consideration for the people , he should keep them\n",
      "his friends . The kingdom of the Soldan is similar ; being entirely in\n",
      "the hands of soldiers , it follows again that , without regard to the\n",
      "people , he must keep them his friends . But you must note that the state\n",
      "of the Soldan is unlike all other principalities , for the reason that\n",
      "it is like the Christian pontificate , which can not be called either an\n",
      "hereditary or a newly formed principality ; because the sons of the old\n",
      "prince are not the heirs , but he who is elected to that position by\n",
      "those who have authority , and the sons remain only noblemen . And this\n",
      "being an ancient custom , it can not be called a new principality ,\n",
      "because there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in\n",
      "new ones ; for although the prince is new , the constitution of the state\n",
      "is old , and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its\n",
      "hereditary lord .\n",
      "\n",
      "But returning to the subject of our discourse , I say that whoever will\n",
      "consider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been\n",
      "fatal to the above-named emperors , and it will be recognized also how\n",
      "it happened that , a number of them acting in one way and a number in\n",
      "another , only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to\n",
      "unhappy ones . Because it would have been useless and dangerous for\n",
      "Pertinax and Alexander , being new princes , to imitate Marcus , who was\n",
      "heir to the principality ; and likewise it would have been utterly\n",
      "destructive to Caracalla , Commodus , and Maximinus to have imitated\n",
      "Severus , they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread in\n",
      "his footsteps . Therefore a prince , new to the principality , can not\n",
      "imitate the actions of Marcus , nor , again , is it necessary to follow\n",
      "those of Severus , but he ought to take from Severus those parts which\n",
      "are necessary to found his state , and from Marcus those which are\n",

      "CHAPTER XX .\n",
      "ARE FORTRESSES , AND MANY OTHER THINGS TO WHICH PRINCES OFTEN RESORT ,\n",
      "ADVANTAGEOUS OR HURTFUL ?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1 . Some princes , so as to hold securely the state , have disarmed their\n",
      "subjects ; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions ;\n",
      "others have fostered enmities against themselves ; others have laid\n",
      "themselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning\n",
      "of their governments ; some have built fortresses ; some have overthrown\n",
      "and destroyed them . And although one can not give a final judgment on\n",
      "all of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those\n",
      "states in which a decision has to be made , nevertheless I will speak as\n",
      "comprehensively as the matter of itself will admit .\n",
      "\n",
      "2 . There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects ; rather\n",
      "when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them , because , by\n",
      "arming them , those arms become yours , those men who were distrusted\n",
      "become faithful , and those who were faithful are kept so , and your\n",
      "subjects become your adherents . And whereas all subjects can not be\n",
      "armed , yet when those whom you do arm are benefited , the others can be\n",
      "handled more freely , and this difference in their treatment , which they\n",
      "quite understand , makes the former your dependents , and the latter ,\n",
      "considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and\n",
      "service should have the most reward , excuse you . But when you disarm\n",
      "them , you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them , either\n",
      "for cowardice or for want of loyalty , and either of these opinions\n",
      "breeds hatred against you . And because you can not remain unarmed , it\n",
      "follows that you turn to mercenaries , which are of the character\n",
      "already shown ; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient\n",
      "to defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects .\n",
      "Therefore , as I have said , a new prince in a new principality has\n",
      "always distributed arms . Histories are full of examples . But when a\n",
      "prince acquires a new state , which he adds as a province to his old\n",
      "one , then it is necessary to disarm the men of that state , except those\n",
      "who have been his adherents in acquiring it ; and these again , with time\n",
      "and opportunity , should be rendered soft and effeminate ; and matters\n",
      "should be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state\n",
      "shall be your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you .\n",
      "\n",
      "3 . Our forefathers , and those who were reckoned wise , were accustomed\n",
      "to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by\n",
      "fortresses ; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their\n",
      "tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily . This\n",
      "may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way\n",
      "balanced , but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept for\n",
      "to-day , because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use ;\n",
      "rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided\n",
      "cities you are quickly lost , because the weakest party will always\n",
      "assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist . The\n",
      "Venetians , moved , as I believe , by the above reasons , fostered the\n",
      "Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities ; and although\n",
      "they never allowed them to come to bloodshed , yet they nursed these\n",
      "disputes amongst them , so that the citizens , distracted by their\n",
      "differences , should not unite against them . Which , as we saw , did not\n",
      "afterwards turn out as expected , because , after the rout at Vaila , one\n",
      "party at once took courage and seized the state . Such methods argue ,\n",
      "therefore , weakness in the prince , because these factions will never be\n",
      "permitted in a vigorous principality ; such methods for enabling one the\n",
      "more easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace , but\n",
      "if war comes this policy proves fallacious .\n",
      "\n",
      "4 . Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the\n",
      "difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted , and therefore\n",
      "fortune , especially when she desires to make a new prince great , who\n",
      "has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one , causes\n",
      "enemies to arise and form designs against him , in order that he may\n",
      "have the opportunity of overcoming them , and by them to mount higher ,\n",
      "as by a ladder which his enemies have raised . For this reason many\n",
      "consider that a wise prince , when he has the opportunity , ought with\n",
      "craft to foster some animosity against himself , so that , having crushed\n",
      "it , his renown may rise higher .\n",
      "\n",
      "5 . Princes , especially new ones , have found more fidelity and\n",
      "assistance in those men who in the beginning of their rule were\n",
      "distrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted . Pandolfo\n",
      "Petrucci , Prince of Siena , ruled his state more by those who had been\n",
      "distrusted than by others . But on this question one can not speak\n",
      "generally , for it varies so much with the individual ; I will only say\n",
      "this , that those men who at the commencement of a princedom have been\n",
      "hostile , if they are of a description to need assistance to support\n",
      "themselves , can always be gained over with the greatest ease , and they\n",
      "will be tightly held to serve the prince with fidelity , inasmuch as\n",
      "they know it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad\n",
      "impression which he had formed of them ; and thus the prince always\n",
      "extracts more profit from them than from those who , serving him in too\n",
      "much security , may neglect his affairs . And since the matter demands\n",
      "it , I must not fail to warn a prince , who by means of secret favours\n",
      "has acquired a new state , that he must well consider the reasons which\n",
      "induced those to favour him who did so ; and if it be not a natural\n",
      "affection towards him , but only discontent with their government , then\n",
      "he will only keep them friendly with great trouble and difficulty , for\n",
      "it will be impossible to satisfy them . And weighing well the reasons\n",
      "for this in those examples which can be taken from ancient and modern\n",
      "affairs , we shall find that it is easier for the prince to make friends\n",
      "of those men who were contented under the former government , and are\n",
      "therefore his enemies , than of those who , being discontented with it ,\n",
      "were favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it .\n",
      "\n",
      "6 . It has been a custom with princes , in order to hold their states\n",
      "more securely , to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit\n",
      "to those who might design to work against them , and as a place of\n",
      "refuge from a first attack . I praise this system because it has been\n",
      "made use of formerly . Notwithstanding that , Messer Nicolo Vitelli in\n",
      "our times has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello\n",
      "so that he might keep that state ; Guido Ubaldo , Duke of Urbino , on\n",
      "returning to his dominion , whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia ,\n",
      "razed to the foundations all the fortresses in that province , and\n",
      "considered that without them it would be more difficult to lose it ; the\n",
      "Bentivogli returning to Bologna came to a similar decision . Fortresses ,\n",
      "therefore , are useful or not according to circumstances ; if they do you\n",
      "good in one way they injure you in another . And this question can be\n",
      "reasoned thus : the prince who has more to fear from the people than\n",
      "from foreigners ought to build fortresses , but he who has more to fear\n",
      "from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone . The\n",
      "castle of Milan , built by Francesco Sforza , has made , and will make ,\n",
      "more trouble for the house of Sforza than any other disorder in the\n",
      "state . For this reason the best possible fortress is—not to be hated by\n",
      "the people , because , although you may hold the fortresses , yet they\n",
      "will not save you if the people hate you , for there will never be\n",
      "wanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you .\n",
      "It has not been seen in our times that such fortresses have been of use\n",
      "to any prince , unless to the Countess of Forli , [ 1 ] when the Count\n",
      "Girolamo , her consort , was killed ; for by that means she was able to\n",
      "withstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan , and\n",
      "thus recover her state ; and the posture of affairs was such at that\n",
      "time that the foreigners could not assist the people . But fortresses\n",
      "were of little value to her afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked her ,\n",
      "and when the people , her enemy , were allied with foreigners . Therefore ,\n",
      "it would have been safer for her , both then and before , not to have\n",
      "been hated by the people than to have had the fortresses . All these\n",
      "things considered then , I shall praise him who builds fortresses as\n",
      "well as him who does not , and I shall blame whoever , trusting in them ,\n",
      "cares little about being hated by the people .\n",

      "\n",
      "Nothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and\n",
      "setting a fine example . We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon , the\n",
      "present King of Spain . He can almost be called a new prince , because he\n",
      "has risen , by fame and glory , from being an insignificant king to be\n",
      "the foremost king in Christendom ; and if you will consider his deeds\n",
      "you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary . In the\n",
      "beginning of his reign he attacked Granada , and this enterprise was the\n",
      "foundation of his dominions . He did this quietly at first and without\n",
      "any fear of hindrance , for he held the minds of the barons of Castile\n",
      "occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations ;\n",
      "thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power\n",
      "and authority over them . He was able with the money of the Church and\n",
      "of the people to sustain his armies , and by that long war to lay the\n",
      "foundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him .\n",
      "Further , always using religion as a plea , so as to undertake greater\n",
      "schemes , he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and\n",
      "clearing his kingdom of the Moors ; nor could there be a more admirable\n",
      "example , nor one more rare . Under this same cloak he assailed Africa ,\n",
      "he came down on Italy , he has finally attacked France ; and thus his\n",
      "achievements and designs have always been great , and have kept the\n",
      "minds of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the\n",

      "the other , that men have never been given time to work steadily against\n",

      "Again , it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal\n",
      "affairs , similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da\n",
      "Milano , who , when he had the opportunity , by any one in civil life\n",
      "doing some extraordinary thing , either good or bad , would take some\n",
      "method of rewarding or punishing him , which would be much spoken about .\n",
      "And a prince ought , above all things , always endeavour in every action\n",
      "to gain for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man .\n",
      "\n",
      "A prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a\n",
      "downright enemy , that is to say , when , without any reservation , he\n",
      "declares himself in favour of one party against the other ; which course\n",
      "will always be more advantageous than standing neutral ; because if two\n",
      "of your powerful neighbours come to blows , they are of such a character\n",
      "that , if one of them conquers , you have either to fear him or not . In\n",
      "either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare\n",
      "yourself and to make war strenuously ; because , in the first case , if\n",
      "you do not declare yourself , you will invariably fall a prey to the\n",
      "conqueror , to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been\n",
      "conquered , and you will have no reasons to offer , nor anything to\n",
      "protect or to shelter you . Because he who conquers does not want\n",
      "doubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial ; and he who\n",
      "loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly , sword in\n",
      "hand , court his fate .\n",

      "Antiochus went into Greece , being sent for by the Ætolians to drive out\n",
      "the Romans . He sent envoys to the Achaeans , who were friends of the\n",
      "Romans , exhorting them to remain neutral ; and on the other hand the\n",
      "Romans urged them to take up arms . This question came to be discussed\n",
      "in the council of the Achaeans , where the legate of Antiochus urged\n",
      "them to stand neutral . To this the Roman legate answered : “ As for that\n",
      "which has been said , that it is better and more advantageous for your\n",
      "state not to interfere in our war , nothing can be more erroneous ;\n",
      "because by not interfering you will be left , without favour or\n",
      "consideration , the guerdon of the conqueror. ” Thus it will always\n",
      "happen that he who is not your friend will demand your neutrality ,\n",
      "whilst he who is your friend will entreat you to declare yourself with\n",
      "arms . And irresolute princes , to avoid present dangers , generally\n",
      "follow the neutral path , and are generally ruined . But when a prince\n",
      "declares himself gallantly in favour of one side , if the party with\n",
      "whom he allies himself conquers , although the victor may be powerful\n",
      "and may have him at his mercy , yet he is indebted to him , and there is\n",
      "established a bond of amity ; and men are never so shameless as to\n",
      "become a monument of ingratitude by oppressing you . Victories after all\n",
      "are never so complete that the victor must not show some regard ,\n",
      "especially to justice . But if he with whom you ally yourself loses , you\n",
      "may be sheltered by him , and whilst he is able he may aid you , and you\n",
      "become companions on a fortune that may rise again .\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second case , when those who fight are of such a character that\n",
      "you have no anxiety as to who may conquer , so much the more is it\n",
      "greater prudence to be allied , because you assist at the destruction of\n",
      "one by the aid of another who , if he had been wise , would have saved\n",
      "him ; and conquering , as it is impossible that he should not do with\n",
      "your assistance , he remains at your discretion . And here it is to be\n",
      "noted that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with\n",
      "one more powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others ,\n",
      "unless necessity compels him , as is said above ; because if he conquers\n",
      "you are at his discretion , and princes ought to avoid as much as\n",
      "possible being at the discretion of any one . The Venetians joined with\n",
      "France against the Duke of Milan , and this alliance , which caused their\n",
      "ruin , could have been avoided . But when it can not be avoided , as\n",
      "happened to the Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to\n",
      "attack Lombardy , then in such a case , for the above reasons , the prince\n",
      "ought to favour one of the parties .\n",
      "\n",
      "Never let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe\n",
      "courses ; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones ,\n",
      "because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid\n",
      "one trouble without running into another ; but prudence consists in\n",
      "knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles , and for choice to\n",
      "take the lesser evil .\n",
      "\n",
      "A prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability , and to honour\n",
      "the proficient in every art . At the same time he should encourage his\n",
      "citizens to practise their callings peaceably , both in commerce and\n",
      "agriculture , and in every other following , so that the one should not\n",
      "be deterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken\n",
      "away from him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes ; but\n",
      "the prince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things\n",
      "and designs in any way to honour his city or state .\n",
      "\n",
      "Further , he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles\n",
      "at convenient seasons of the year ; and as every city is divided into\n",
      "guilds or into societies , [ 1 ] he ought to hold such bodies in esteem ,\n",
      "and associate with them sometimes , and show himself an example of\n",
      "courtesy and liberality ; nevertheless , always maintaining the majesty\n",
      "of his rank , for this he must never consent to abate in anything .\n",

      "first opinion which one forms of a prince , and of his understanding , is\n",
      "by observing the men he has around him ; and when they are capable and\n",
      "faithful he may always be considered wise , because he has known how to\n",
      "recognize the capable and to keep them faithful . But when they are\n",
      "otherwise one can not form a good opinion of him , for the prime error\n",
      "which he made was in choosing them .\n",
      "\n",
      "There were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of\n",
      "Pandolfo Petrucci , Prince of Siena , who would not consider Pandolfo to\n",
      "be a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant . Because there\n",

      "another which appreciates what others comprehended ; and a third which\n",
      "neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others ; the first\n",
      "is the most excellent , the second is good , the third is useless .\n",
      "Therefore , it follows necessarily that , if Pandolfo was not in the\n",
      "first rank , he was in the second , for whenever one has judgment to know\n",
      "good and bad when it is said and done , although he himself may not have\n",
      "the initiative , yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his\n",
      "servant , and the one he can praise and the other correct ; thus the\n",

      "\n",
      "But to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one\n",
      "test which never fails ; when you see the servant thinking more of his\n",
      "own interests than of yours , and seeking inwardly his own profit in\n",
      "everything , such a man will never make a good servant , nor will you\n",
      "ever be able to trust him ; because he who has the state of another in\n",
      "his hands ought never to think of himself , but always of his prince ,\n",
      "and never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not\n",
      "concerned .\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand , to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study\n",
      "him , honouring him , enriching him , doing him kindnesses , sharing with\n",
      "him the honours and cares ; and at the same time let him see that he\n",

      "HOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject , for it\n",
      "is a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved , unless\n",
      "they are very careful and discriminating . It is that of flatterers , of\n",
      "whom courts are full , because men are so self-complacent in their own\n",
      "affairs , and in a way so deceived in them , that they are preserved with\n",
      "difficulty from this pest , and if they wish to defend themselves they\n",
      "run the danger of falling into contempt . Because there is no other way\n",
      "of guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that\n",
      "to tell you the truth does not offend you ; but when every one may tell\n",
      "you the truth , respect for you abates .\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the\n",
      "wise men in his state , and giving to them only the liberty of speaking\n",
      "the truth to him , and then only of those things of which he inquires ,\n",
      "and of none others ; but he ought to question them upon everything , and\n",
      "listen to their opinions , and afterwards form his own conclusions . With\n",
      "these councillors , separately and collectively , he ought to carry\n",
      "himself in such a way that each of them should know that , the more\n",
      "freely he shall speak , the more he shall be preferred ; outside of\n",
      "these , he should listen to no one , pursue the thing resolved on , and be\n",
      "steadfast in his resolutions . He who does otherwise is either\n",
      "overthrown by flatterers , or is so often changed by varying opinions\n",
      "that he falls into contempt .\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish on this subject to adduce a modern example . Fra Luca , the man of\n",
      "affairs to Maximilian , [ 1 ] the present emperor , speaking of his majesty ,\n",
      "said : He consulted with no one , yet never got his own way in anything .\n",
      "This arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the\n",
      "above ; for the emperor is a secretive man—he does not communicate his\n",
      "designs to any one , nor does he receive opinions on them . But as in\n",
      "carrying them into effect they become revealed and known , they are at\n",
      "once obstructed by those men whom he has around him , and he , being\n",
      "pliant , is diverted from them . Hence it follows that those things he\n",
      "does one day he undoes the next , and no one ever understands what he\n",
      "wishes or intends to do , and no one can rely on his resolutions .\n",
      "\n",
      "[ 1 ] Maximilian I , born in 1459 , died 1519 , Emperor of the Holy Roman\n",

      "her death , Bianca Sforza ; and thus became involved in Italian\n",
      "politics .\n",
      "\n",
      "A prince , therefore , ought always to take counsel , but only when he\n",
      "wishes and not when others wish ; he ought rather to discourage every\n",
      "one from offering advice unless he asks it ; but , however , he ought to\n",
      "be a constant inquirer , and afterwards a patient listener concerning\n",
      "the things of which he inquired ; also , on learning that any one , on any\n",
      "consideration , has not told him the truth , he should let his anger be\n",
      "felt .\n",
      "\n",
      "And if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an impression\n",
      "of his wisdom is not so through his own ability , but through the good\n",
      "advisers that he has around him , beyond doubt they are deceived ,\n",
      "because this is an axiom which never fails : that a prince who is not\n",
      "wise himself will never take good advice , unless by chance he has\n",
      "yielded his affairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very\n",
      "prudent man . In this case indeed he may be well governed , but it would\n",
      "not be for long , because such a governor would in a short time take\n",
      "away his state from him .\n",
      "\n",
      "But if a prince who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more\n",
      "than one he will never get united counsels , nor will he know how to\n",
      "unite them . Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests ,\n",
      "and the prince will not know how to control them or to see through\n",
      "them . And they are not to be found otherwise , because men will always\n",
      "prove untrue to you unless they are kept honest by constraint .\n",
      "Therefore it must be inferred that good counsels , whencesoever they\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The previous suggestions , carefully observed , will enable a new prince\n",
      "to appear well established , and render him at once more secure and\n",
      "fixed in the state than if he had been long seated there . For the\n",
      "actions of a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an\n",
      "hereditary one , and when they are seen to be able they gain more men\n",
      "and bind far tighter than ancient blood ; because men are attracted more\n",
      "by the present than by the past , and when they find the present good\n",
      "they enjoy it and seek no further ; they will also make the utmost\n",
      "defence of a prince if he fails them not in other things . Thus it will\n",
      "be a double glory for him to have established a new principality , and\n",
      "adorned and strengthened it with good laws , good arms , good allies , and\n",
      "with a good example ; so will it be a double disgrace to him who , born a\n",
      "prince , shall lose his state by want of wisdom .\n",
      "\n",
      "And if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in\n",
      "Italy in our times , such as the King of Naples , the Duke of Milan , and\n",
      "others , there will be found in them , firstly , one common defect in\n",
      "regard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length ; in\n",
      "the next place , some one of them will be seen , either to have had the\n",
      "people hostile , or if he has had the people friendly , he has not known\n",
      "how to secure the nobles . In the absence of these defects states that\n",
      "have power enough to keep an army in the field can not be lost .\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip of Macedon , not the father of Alexander the Great , but he who\n",
      "was conquered by Titus Quintius , had not much territory compared to the\n",
      "greatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him , yet being a\n",
      "warlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles ,\n",
      "he sustained the war against his enemies for many years , and if in the\n",
      "end he lost the dominion of some cities , nevertheless he retained the\n",
      "kingdom .\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore , do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their\n",
      "principalities after so many years ’ possession , but rather their own\n",

      "It is not unknown to me how many men have had , and still have , the\n",
      "opinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by\n",
      "fortune and by God that men with their wisdom can not direct them and\n",
      "that no one can even help them ; and because of this they would have us\n",
      "believe that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs , but to let\n",
      "chance govern them . This opinion has been more credited in our times\n",
      "because of the great changes in affairs which have been seen , and may\n",
      "still be seen , every day , beyond all human conjecture . Sometimes\n",
      "pondering over this , I am in some degree inclined to their opinion .\n",
      "Nevertheless , not to extinguish our free will , I hold it to be true\n",
      "that Fortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions , [ 1 ] but that she\n",
      "still leaves us to direct the other half , or perhaps a little less .\n",
      "\n",
      "[ 1 ] Frederick the Great was accustomed to say : “ The older one gets the\n",

      "I compare her to one of those raging rivers , which when in flood\n",
      "overflows the plains , sweeping away trees and buildings , bearing away\n",
      "the soil from place to place ; everything flies before it , all yield to\n",
      "its violence , without being able in any way to withstand it ; and yet ,\n",
      "though its nature be such , it does not follow therefore that men , when\n",
      "the weather becomes fair , shall not make provision , both with defences\n",
      "and barriers , in such a manner that , rising again , the waters may pass\n",
      "away by canal , and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so\n",
      "dangerous . So it happens with fortune , who shows her power where valour\n",
      "has not prepared to resist her , and thither she turns her forces where\n",
      "she knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain\n",
      "her .\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you will consider Italy , which is the seat of these changes , and\n",
      "which has given to them their impulse , you will see it to be an open\n",
      "country without barriers and without any defence . For if it had been\n",

      "believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions\n",
      "according to the spirit of the times , and that he whose actions do not\n",
      "accord with the times will not be successful . Because men are seen , in\n",
      "affairs that lead to the end which every man has before him , namely ,\n",
      "glory and riches , to get there by various methods ; one with caution ,\n",
      "another with haste ; one by force , another by skill ; one by patience ,\n",
      "another by its opposite ; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by\n",
      "a different method . One can also see of two cautious men the one attain\n",
      "his end , the other fail ; and similarly , two men by different\n",
      "observances are equally successful , the one being cautious , the other\n",
      "impetuous ; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they\n",

      "DUKE DI GRAVINA ORSINI\n",

      "BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy , where he had been to\n",
      "clear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been\n",
      "raised against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of\n",
      "Arezzo and other towns in the Val di Chiana , and had arrived at Imola ,\n",
      "whence he intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against\n",
      "Giovanni Bentivogli , the tyrant of Bologna : for he intended to bring\n",
      "that city under his domination , and to make it the head of his\n",
      "Romagnian duchy .\n",
      "\n",
      "These matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and\n",
      "their following , it appeared to them that the duke would become too\n",
      "powerful , and it was feared that , having seized Bologna , he would seek\n",
      "to destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy . Upon\n",
      "this a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia , to\n",
      "which came the cardinal , Pagolo , and the Duke di Gravina Orsini ,\n",
      "Vitellozzo Vitelli , Oliverotto da Fermo , Gianpagolo Baglioni , the\n",
      "tyrant of Perugia , and Messer Antonio da Venafro , sent by Pandolfo\n",
      "Petrucci , the Prince of Siena . Here were discussed the power and\n",
      "courage of the duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions , which\n",
      "might otherwise bring danger to the rest of being ruined . And they\n",
      "decided not to abandon the Bentivogli , but to strive to win over the\n",
      "Florentines ; and they sent their men to one place and another ,\n",
      "promising to one party assistance and to another encouragement to unite\n",
      "with them against the common enemy . This meeting was at once reported\n",
      "throughout all Italy , and those who were discontented under the duke ,\n",
      "among whom were the people of Urbino , took hope of effecting a\n",
      "revolution .\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it arose that , men ’ s minds being thus unsettled , it was decided by\n",
      "certain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo , which was held\n",
      "for the duke , and which they captured by the following means . The\n",
      "castellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there ;\n",
      "so the conspirators watched , and when certain beams which were being\n",
      "carried to the rock were upon the bridge , so that it was prevented from\n",
      "being drawn up by those inside , they took the opportunity of leaping\n",
      "upon the bridge and thence into the fortress . Upon this capture being\n",
      "effected , the whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke , being\n",
      "encouraged in this , not so much by the capture of the fort , as by the\n",
      "Diet at Magione , from whom they expected to get assistance .\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose\n",
      "the opportunity , and at once assembled their men so as to take any\n",
      "town , should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state ; and\n",
      "they sent again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in\n",
      "destroying the common firebrand , showing that the risk was lessened and\n",
      "that they ought not to wait for another opportunity .\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Florentines , from hatred , for sundry reasons , of the Vitelli\n",
      "and Orsini , not only would not ally themselves , but sent Nicolo\n",
      "Machiavelli , their secretary , to offer shelter and assistance to the\n",
      "duke against his enemies . The duke was found full of fear at Imola ,\n",
      "because , against everybody ’ s expectation , his soldiers had at once gone\n",
      "over to the enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door .\n",
      "But recovering courage from the offers of the Florentines , he decided\n",
      "to temporize before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to\n",
      "him , and to negotiate for a reconciliation , and also to get assistance .\n",
      "This latter he obtained in two ways , by sending to the King of France\n",
      "for men and by enlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into\n",
      "cavalry of a sort : to all he gave money .\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding this , his enemies drew near to him , and approached\n",
      "Fossombrone , where they encountered some men of the duke and , with the\n",
      "aid of the Orsini and Vitelli , routed them . When this happened , the\n",
      "duke resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with\n",
      "offers of reconciliation , and being a most perfect dissembler he did\n",
      "not fail in any practices to make the insurgents understand that he\n",
      "wished every man who had acquired anything to keep it , as it was enough\n",
      "for him to have the title of prince , whilst others might have the\n",
      "principality .\n",
      "\n",
      "And the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to\n",
      "him to negotiate for a reconciliation , and they brought their army to a\n",
      "standstill . But the duke did not stop his preparations , and took every\n",
      "care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry , and that such\n",
      "preparations might not be apparent to the others , he sent his troops in\n",
      "separate parties to every part of the Romagna . In the meanwhile there\n",
      "came also to him five hundred French lancers , and although he found\n",
      "himself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open\n",
      "war , he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous to\n",
      "outwit them , and for this reason he did not stop the work of\n",
      "reconciliation .\n",
      "\n",
      "And that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in\n",
      "which he confirmed their former covenants ; he gave them four thousand\n",
      "ducats at once ; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli ; and he formed\n",
      "an alliance with Giovanni ; and moreover he would not force them to come\n",
      "personally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so . On the\n",
      "other hand , they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and\n",
      "other places seized by them , to serve him in all his expeditions , and\n",
      "not to make war against or ally themselves with any one without his\n",
      "permission .\n",
      "\n",
      "This reconciliation being completed , Guido Ubaldo , the Duke of Urbino ,\n",
      "again fled to Venice , having first destroyed all the fortresses in his\n",
      "state ; because , trusting in the people , he did not wish that the\n",
      "fortresses , which he did not think he could defend , should be held by\n",
      "the enemy , since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends .\n",
      "But the Duke Valentino , having completed this convention , and dispersed\n",
      "his men throughout the Romagna , set out for Imola at the end of\n",
      "November together with his French men-at-arms : thence he went to\n",
      "Cesena , where he stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the\n",
      "Vitelli and Orsini , who had assembled with their men in the duchy of\n",
      "Urbino , as to the enterprise in which they should now take part ; but\n",
      "nothing being concluded , Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that\n",
      "if the duke wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were\n",
      "ready ; if he did not wish it , then they would besiege Sinigalia . To\n",
      "this the duke replied that he did not wish to enter into war with\n",
      "Tuscany , and thus become hostile to the Florentines , but that he was\n",
      "very willing to proceed against Sinigalia .\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered , but the\n",
      "fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give\n",
      "it up to any one but the duke in person ; therefore they exhorted him to\n",
      "come there . This appeared a good opportunity to the duke , as , being\n",
      "invited by them , and not going of his own will , he would awaken no\n",
      "suspicions . And the more to reassure them , he allowed all the French\n",
      "men-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart , except the hundred\n",
      "lancers under Mons . di Candales , his brother-in-law . He left Cesena\n",
      "about the middle of December , and went to Fano , and with the utmost\n",
      "cunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for\n",
      "him at Sinigalia , pointing out to them that any lack of compliance\n",
      "would cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the\n",
      "reconciliation , and that he was a man who wished to make use of the\n",
      "arms and councils of his friends . But Vitellozzo remained very\n",
      "stubborn , for the death of his brother warned him that he should not\n",
      "offend a prince and afterwards trust him ; nevertheless , persuaded by\n",
      "Pagolo Orsini , whom the duke had corrupted with gifts and promises , he\n",
      "agreed to wait .\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this the duke , before his departure from Fano , which was to be on\n",
      "30th December 1502 , communicated his designs to eight of his most\n",
      "trusted followers , among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor\n",
      "d ’ Euna , who was afterwards cardinal ; and he ordered that , as soon as\n",
      "Vitellozzo , Pagolo Orsini , the Duke di Gravina , and Oliverotto should\n",
      "arrive , his followers in pairs should take them one by one , entrusting\n",
      "certain men to certain pairs , who should entertain them until they\n",
      "reached Sinigalia ; nor should they be permitted to leave until they\n",
      "came to the duke ’ s quarters , where they should be seized .\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry , of which\n",
      "there were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen , to\n",
      "assemble by daybreak at the Metauro , a river five miles distant from\n",
      "Fano , and await him there . He found himself , therefore , on the last day\n",
      "of December at the Metauro with his men , and having sent a cavalcade of\n",
      "about two hundred horsemen before him , he then moved forward the\n",
      "infantry , whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms .\n",
      "\n",
      "Fano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situated on the shore of\n",
      "the Adriatic Sea , fifteen miles distant from each other , so that he who\n",
      "goes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand , the bases\n",
      "of which are touched by the sea in some places . The city of Sinigalia\n",
      "is distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot\n",
      "and from the shore about a mile . On the side opposite to the city runs\n",
      "a little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards\n",
      "Fano , facing the high road . Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes\n",
      "for a good space by road along the mountains , and reaches the river\n",
      "which passes by Sinigalia . If he turns to his left hand along the bank\n",
      "of it , and goes for the distance of a bow-shot , he arrives at a bridge\n",
      "which crosses the river ; he is then almost abreast of the gate that\n",
      "leads into Sinigalia , not by a straight line , but transversely . Before\n",
      "this gate there stands a collection of houses with a square to which\n",
      "the bank of the river forms one side .\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke , and\n",
      "to honour him in person , sent away their men to several castles distant\n",
      "from Sinigalia about six miles , so that room could be made for the men\n",
      "of the duke ; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band ,\n",
      "which consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty\n",
      "horsemen , who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above . Matters\n",
      "having been thus arranged , the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia , and\n",
      "when the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass\n",
      "over , but having opened it , one portion wheeled towards the river and\n",
      "the other towards the country , and a way was left in the middle through\n",
      "which the infantry passed , without stopping , into the town .\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitellozzo , Pagolo , and the Duke di Gravina on mules , accompanied by a\n",
      "few horsemen , went towards the duke ; Vitellozo , unarmed and wearing a\n",
      "cape lined with green , appeared very dejected , as if conscious of his\n",
      "approaching death—a circumstance which , in view of the ability of the\n",
      "man and his former fortune , caused some amazement . And it is said that\n",
      "when he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet\n",
      "the duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them . He\n",
      "recommended his house and its fortunes to his captains , and advised his\n",
      "nephews that it was not the fortune of their house , but the virtues of\n",
      "their fathers that should be kept in mind . These three , therefore , came\n",
      "before the duke and saluted him respectfully , and were received by him\n",
      "with goodwill ; they were at once placed between those who were\n",
      "commissioned to look after them .\n",
      "\n",
      "But the duke noticing that Oliverotto , who had remained with his band\n",
      "in Sinigalia , was missing—for Oliverotto was waiting in the square\n",
      "before his quarters near the river , keeping his men in order and\n",
      "drilling them—signalled with his eye to Don Michelle , to whom the care\n",
      "of Oliverotto had been committed , that he should take measures that\n",
      "Oliverotto should not escape . Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined\n",
      "Oliverotto , telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of\n",
      "their quarters , because these might be taken up by the men of the duke ;\n",
      "and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come\n",
      "himself to meet the duke . And Oliverotto , having taken this advice ,\n",
      "came before the duke , who , when he saw him , called to him ; and\n",
      "Oliverotto , having made his obeisance , joined the others .\n",
      "\n",
      "So the whole party entered Sinigalia , dismounted at the duke ’ s\n",
      "quarters , and went with him into a secret chamber , where the duke made\n",
      "them prisoners ; he then mounted on horseback , and issued orders that\n",
      "the men of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms .\n",
      "Those of Oliverotto , being at hand , were quickly settled , but those of\n",
      "the Orsini and Vitelli , being at a distance , and having a presentiment\n",
      "of the destruction of their masters , had time to prepare themselves ,\n",
      "and bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and\n",
      "Vitellian houses , they stood together against the hostile forces of the\n",
      "country and saved themselves .\n",
      "\n",
      "But the duke ’ s soldiers , not being content with having pillaged the men\n",
      "of Oliverotto , began to sack Sinigalia , and if the duke had not\n",
      "repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have\n",
      "completely sacked it . Night having come and the tumult being silenced ,\n",
      "the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto ; he led them into a\n",
      "room and caused them to be strangled . Neither of them used words in\n",
      "keeping with their past lives : Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of\n",
      "the pope full pardon for his sins ; Oliverotto cringed and laid the\n",
      "blame for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo . Pagolo and the\n",
      "Duke di Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome\n",
      "that the pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino , the Archbishop of\n",
      "Florence , and Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce . After which news , on 18th\n",
      "January 1502 , in the castle of Pieve , they also were strangled in the\n",

      "It appears , dearest Zanobi and Luigi , a wonderful thing to those who\n",
      "have considered the matter , that all men , or the larger number of them ,\n",
      "who have performed great deeds in the world , and excelled all others in\n",
      "their day , have had their birth and beginning in baseness and\n",
      "obscurity ; or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way .\n",
      "They have either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts , or they have\n",
      "had so mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to\n",
      "be sons of Jove or of some other deity . It would be wearisome to relate\n",
      "who these persons may have been because they are well known to\n",
      "everybody , and , as such tales would not be particularly edifying to\n",
      "those who read them , they are omitted . I believe that these lowly\n",
      "beginnings of great men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to\n",
      "the world that such men owe much to her and little to wisdom , because\n",
      "she begins to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in\n",
      "their career : thus all success must be attributed to her . Castruccio\n",
      "Castracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds , if he is\n",
      "measured by the times in which he lived and the city in which he was\n",
      "born ; but , like many others , he was neither fortunate nor distinguished\n",
      "in his birth , as the course of this history will show . It appeared to\n",
      "be desirable to recall his memory , because I have discerned in him such\n",
      "indications of valour and fortune as should make him a great exemplar\n",
      "to men . I think also that I ought to call your attention to his\n",
      "actions , because you of all men I know delight most in noble deeds .\n",
      "\n",
      "The family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families\n",
      "of Lucca , but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in\n",
      "estate , as so often happens in this world . To this family was born a\n",
      "son Antonio , who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca ,\n",
      "and for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio . He\n",
      "had an only sister , who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami , but\n",
      "Buonaccorso dying she became a widow , and not wishing to marry again\n",
      "went to live with her brother . Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the\n",
      "house where he resided , and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens ,\n",
      "any person could have access to it without difficulty . One morning ,\n",
      "shortly after sunrise , Madonna Dianora , as the sister of Messer Antonio\n",
      "was called , had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather\n",
      "herbs for seasoning the dinner , and hearing a slight rustling among the\n",
      "leaves of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction , and heard\n",
      "something resembling the cry of an infant . Whereupon she went towards\n",
      "it , and saw the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the\n",
      "leaves and who seemed to be crying for its mother . Partly wondering and\n",
      "partly fearing , yet full of compassion , she lifted it up and carried it\n",
      "to the house , where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is\n",
      "customary , and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home . When\n",
      "he heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised\n",
      "or compassionate than his sister . They discussed between themselves\n",
      "what should be done , and seeing that he was priest and that she had no\n",
      "children , they finally determined to bring it up . They had a nurse for\n",
      "it , and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child . They\n",
      "baptized it , and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father . As\n",
      "the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome , and gave evidence of\n",
      "wit and discretion , and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those\n",
      "lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him . Messer Antonio intended\n",
      "to make a priest of him , and in time would have inducted him into his\n",
      "canonry and other benefices , and all his instruction was given with\n",
      "this object ; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio\n",
      "was quite unfitted for the priesthood . As soon as Castruccio reached\n",
      "the age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of\n",
      "Messer Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them ; he left\n",
      "off reading ecclesiastical books , and turned to playing with arms ,\n",
      "delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses , and in\n",
      "running , leaping , and wrestling with other boys . In all exercises he\n",
      "far excelled his companions in courage and bodily strength , and if at\n",
      "any time he did turn to books , only those pleased him which told of\n",
      "wars and the mighty deeds of men . Messer Antonio beheld all this with\n",
      "vexation and sorrow .\n",
      "\n",
      "There lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family ,\n",
      "named Messer Francesco , whose profession was arms and who in riches ,\n",
      "bodily strength , and valour excelled all other men in Lucca . He had\n",
      "often fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan , and as a\n",
      "Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca . This gentleman\n",
      "resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most\n",
      "mornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta , which is at the\n",
      "top of the square of San Michele , the finest square in Lucca , and he\n",
      "had often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street\n",
      "in those games of which I have spoken . Noticing that Castruccio far\n",
      "excelled the other boys , and that he appeared to exercise a royal\n",
      "authority over them , and that they loved and obeyed him , Messer\n",
      "Francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was . Being\n",
      "informed of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt\n",
      "a greater desire to have him near to him . Therefore he called him one\n",
      "day and asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of\n",
      "a gentleman , where he would learn to ride horses and use arms , or in\n",
      "the house of a priest , where he would learn nothing but masses and the\n",
      "services of the Church . Messer Francesco could see that it pleased\n",
      "Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of , even though he\n",
      "stood silent , blushing modestly ; but being encouraged by Messer\n",
      "Francesco to speak , he answered that , if his master were agreeable ,\n",
      "nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and\n",
      "take up those of a soldier . This reply delighted Messer Francesco , and\n",
      "in a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio , who was\n",
      "driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad , and the fear\n",
      "that he would not be able to hold him much longer .\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest to\n",
      "the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier , and it was\n",
      "astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that\n",
      "virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true\n",
      "gentleman . In the first place he became an accomplished horseman , and\n",
      "could manage with ease the most fiery charger , and in all jousts and\n",
      "tournaments , although still a youth , he was observed beyond all others ,\n",
      "and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity . But what\n",
      "enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments , was the delightful\n",
      "modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to\n",
      "others , for he was deferential to the great men , modest with his\n",
      "equals , and courteous to his inferiors . These gifts made him beloved ,\n",
      "not only by all the Guinigi family , but by all Lucca . When Castruccio\n",
      "had reached his eighteenth year , the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia\n",
      "by the Guelphs , and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist\n",
      "the Ghibellines , and with him went Castruccio , in charge of his forces .\n",
      "Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this\n",
      "expedition , acquiring greater reputation than any other captain , and\n",
      "his name and fame were known , not only in Pavia , but throughout all\n",
      "Lombardy .\n",
      "\n",
      "Castruccio , having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation than he\n",
      "left it , did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many\n",
      "friends as he could , neglecting none of those arts which are necessary\n",
      "for that purpose . About this time Messer Francesco died , leaving a son\n",
      "thirteen years of age named Pagolo , and having appointed Castruccio to\n",
      "be his son ’ s tutor and administrator of his estate . Before he died\n",
      "Francesco called Castruccio to him , and prayed him to show Pagolo that\n",
      "goodwill which he ( Francesco ) had always shown to HIM , and to render to\n",
      "the son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the\n",
      "father . Upon the death of Francesco , Castruccio became the governor and\n",
      "tutor of Pagolo , which increased enormously his power and position , and\n",
      "created a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the\n",
      "former universal goodwill , for many men suspected him of harbouring\n",
      "tyrannical intentions . Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli\n",
      "Opizi , the head of the Guelph party . This man hoped after the death of\n",
      "Messer Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca , but it seemed to him\n",
      "that Castruccio , with the great abilities which he already showed , and\n",
      "holding the position of governor , deprived him of his opportunity ;\n",
      "therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of\n",
      "his eminence . Castruccio at first treated this with scorn , but\n",
      "afterwards he grew alarmed , thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able\n",
      "to bring him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples\n",
      "and have him driven out of Lucca .\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo ,\n",
      "who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became\n",
      "their lord . There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca ,\n",
      "with whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting\n",
      "their restoration by the help of Uguccione . Castruccio also brought\n",
      "into his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of\n",
      "the Opizi . Having fixed upon a plan to be followed , Castruccio\n",
      "cautiously fortified the tower of the Onesti , filling it with supplies\n",
      "and munitions of war , in order that it might stand a siege for a few\n",
      "days in case of need . When the night came which had been agreed upon\n",
      "with Uguccione , who had occupied the plain between the mountains and\n",
      "Pisa with many men , the signal was given , and without being observed\n",
      "Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the\n",
      "portcullis . Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city , calling\n",
      "the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side . Uguccione\n",
      "entered with his men , poured through the town , and killed Messer\n",
      "Giorgio with all his family and many of his friends and supporters . The\n",
      "governor was driven out , and the government reformed according to the\n",
      "wishes of Uguccione , to the detriment of the city , because it was found\n",
      "that more than one hundred families were exiled at that time . Of those\n",
      "who fled , part went to Florence and part to Pistoia , which city was the\n",
      "headquarters of the Guelph party , and for this reason it became most\n",
      "hostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese .\n",
      "\n",
      "As it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party\n",
      "that the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany , they\n",
      "determined to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca . They assembled a\n",
      "large army in the Val di Nievole , and seized Montecatini ; from thence\n",
      "they marched to Montecarlo , in order to secure the free passage into\n",
      "Lucca . Upon this Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces , and\n",
      "with a number of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy , he moved\n",
      "against the quarters of the Florentines , who upon the appearance of the\n",
      "enemy withdrew from Montecarlo , and posted themselves between\n",
      "Montecatini and Pescia . Uguccione now took up a position near to\n",
      "Montecarlo , and within about two miles of the enemy , and slight\n",
      "skirmishes between the horse of both parties were of daily occurrence .\n",
      "Owing to the illness of Uguccione , the Pisans and Lucchese delayed\n",
      "coming to battle with the enemy . Uguccione , finding himself growing\n",
      "worse , went to Montecarlo to be cured , and left the command of the army\n",
      "in the hands of Castruccio . This change brought about the ruin of the\n",
      "Guelphs , who , thinking that the hostile army having lost its captain\n",
      "had lost its head , grew over-confident . Castruccio observed this , and\n",
      "allowed some days to pass in order to encourage this belief ; he also\n",
      "showed signs of fear , and did not allow any of the munitions of the\n",
      "camp to be used . On the other side , the Guelphs grew more insolent the\n",
      "more they saw these evidences of fear , and every day they drew out in\n",
      "the order of battle in front of the army of Castruccio . Presently ,\n",
      "deeming that the enemy was sufficiently emboldened , and having mastered\n",
      "their tactics , he decided to join battle with them . First he spoke a\n",
      "few words of encouragement to his soldiers , and pointed out to them the\n",
      "certainty of victory if they would but obey his commands . Castruccio\n",
      "had noticed how the enemy had placed all his best troops in the centre\n",
      "of the line of battle , and his less reliable men on the wings of the\n",
      "army ; whereupon he did exactly the opposite , putting his most valiant\n",
      "men on the flanks , while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he\n",
      "moved to the centre . Observing this order of battle , he drew out of his\n",
      "lines and quickly came in sight of the hostile army , who , as usual , had\n",
      "come in their insolence to defy him . He then commanded his centre\n",
      "squadrons to march slowly , whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the\n",
      "wings . Thus , when they came into contact with the enemy , only the wings\n",
      "of the two armies became engaged , whilst the center battalions remained\n",
      "out of action , for these two portions of the line of battle were\n",
      "separated from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach\n",
      "each other . By this expedient the more valiant part of Castruccio ’ s men\n",
      "were opposed to the weaker part of the enemy ’ s troops , and the most\n",
      "efficient men of the enemy were disengaged ; and thus the Florentines\n",
      "were unable to fight with those who were arrayed opposite to them , or\n",
      "to give any assistance to their own flanks . So , without much\n",
      "difficulty , Castruccio put the enemy to flight on both flanks , and the\n",
      "centre battalions took to flight when they found themselves exposed to\n",
      "attack , without having a chance of displaying their valour . The defeat\n",
      "was complete , and the loss in men very heavy , there being more than ten\n",
      "thousand men killed with many officers and knights of the Guelph party\n",
      "in Tuscany , and also many princes who had come to help them , among whom\n",
      "were Piero , the brother of King Ruberto , and Carlo , his nephew , and\n",
      "Filippo , the lord of Taranto . On the part of Castruccio the loss did\n",
      "not amount to more than three hundred men , among whom was Francesco ,\n",
      "the son of Uguccione , who , being young and rash , was killed in the\n",
      "first onset .\n",
      "\n",
      "This victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that\n",
      "Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him , because it\n",
      "appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of\n",
      "power , but rather than diminished it . Being of this mind , he only\n",
      "waited for an opportunity to give effect to it . This occurred on the\n",
      "death of Pier Agnolo Micheli , a man of great repute and abilities in\n",
      "Lucca , the murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge .\n",
      "On the sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer , they were\n",
      "driven off by Castruccio , and the murderer escaped . This affair coming\n",
      "to the knowledge of Uguccione , who was then at Pisa , it appeared to him\n",
      "a proper opportunity to punish Castruccio . He therefore sent for his\n",
      "son Neri , who was the governor of Lucca , and commissioned him to take\n",
      "Castruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death . Castruccio ,\n",
      "fearing no evil , went to the governor in a friendly way , was\n",
      "entertained at supper , and then thrown into prison . But Neri , fearing\n",
      "to put him to death lest the people should be incensed , kept him alive ,\n",
      "in order to hear further from his father concerning his intentions .\n",
      "Ugucionne cursed the hesitation and cowardice of his son , and at once\n",
      "set out from Pisa to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the\n",
      "business in his own way ; but he had not yet reached the baths when the\n",
      "Pisans rebelled and put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo\n",

      "close their gates against him . But the Lucchese , having heard of what\n",
      "had happened at Pisa , availed themselves of this opportunity to demand\n",
      "the liberation of Castruccio , notwithstanding that Uguccione had\n",
      "arrived in their city . They first began to speak of it in private\n",
      "circles , afterwards openly in the squares and streets ; then they raised\n",
      "a tumult , and with arms in their hands went to Uguccione and demanded\n",
      "that Castruccio should be set at liberty . Uguccione , fearing that worse\n",
      "might happen , released him from prison . Whereupon Castruccio gathered\n",
      "his friends around him , and with the help of the people attacked\n",
      "Uguccione ; who , finding he had no resource but in flight , rode away\n",
      "with his friends to Lombardy , to the lords of Scale , where he died in\n",
      "poverty .\n",

      "and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people\n",
      "that they appointed him captain of their army for one year . Having\n",
      "obtained this , and wishing to gain renown in war , he planned the\n",
      "recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of\n",
      "Uguccione , and with the help of the Pisans , with whom he had concluded\n",
      "a treaty , he marched to Serezzana . To capture this place he constructed\n",
      "a fort against it , which is called to-day Zerezzanello ; in the course\n",
      "of two months Castruccio captured the town . With the reputation gained\n",
      "at that siege , he rapidly seized Massa , Carrara , and Lavenza , and in a\n",
      "short time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana . In order to close the\n",
      "pass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana , he besieged Pontremoli and\n",
      "wrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini , who was the\n",
      "lord of it . After this victory he returned to Lucca , and was welcomed\n",
      "by the whole people . And now Castruccio , deeming it imprudent any\n",
      "longer to defer making himself a prince , got himself created the lord\n",
      "of Lucca by the help of Pazzino del Poggio , Puccinello dal Portico ,\n",
      "Francesco Boccansacchi , and Cecco Guinigi , all of whom he had\n",

      "the Romans , came into Italy to assume the Imperial crown , and\n",

      "Frederick , having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian\n",
      "affairs , returned to Germany . All the Tuscan and Lombardian\n",
      "Ghibellines , who followed the imperial lead , had recourse to Castruccio\n",
      "for help and counsel , and all promised him the governorship of his\n",

      "Tuscany by the aid of these men and of his own forces ; and in order to\n",
      "gain greater weight in affairs , he entered into a league with Messer\n",
      "Matteo Visconti , the Prince of Milan , and organized for him the forces\n",
      "of his city and the country districts . As Lucca had five gates , he\n",
      "divided his own country districts into five parts , which he supplied\n",
      "with arms , and enrolled the men under captains and ensigns , so that he\n",
      "could quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldiers , without\n",
      "those whom he could summon to his assistance from Pisa . While he\n",
      "surrounded himself with these forces and allies , it happened at Messer\n",
      "Matteo Visconti was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza , who had driven\n",
      "out the Ghibellines with the assistance of a Florentine army and the\n",
      "King Ruberto . Messer Matteo called upon Castruccio to invade the\n",
      "Florentines in their own territories , so that , being attacked at home ,\n",
      "they should be compelled to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to\n",
      "defend themselves . Castruccio invaded the Valdarno , and seized\n",
      "Fucecchio and San Miniato , inflicting immense damage upon the country .\n",
      "Whereupon the Florentines recalled their army , which had scarcely\n",
      "reached Tuscany , when Castruccio was forced by other necessities to\n",
      "return to Lucca .\n",
      "\n",
      "There resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family , who were so\n",
      "powerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio , but even advance\n",
      "him to the dignity of prince ; and it appearing to them they had not\n",
      "received such rewards for their services as they deserved , they incited\n",
      "other families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca . They\n",
      "found their opportunity one morning , and arming themselves , they set\n",
      "upon the lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and\n",
      "killed him . They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt , but Stefano\n",
      "di Poggio , a peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion ,\n",
      "intervened and compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms ;\n",
      "and he offered to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him\n",
      "what they desired . Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater\n",
      "intelligence than they had taken them up . Castruccio , having heard the\n",
      "news of what had happened at Lucca , at once put Pagolo Guinigi in\n",
      "command of the army , and with a troop of cavalry set out for home .\n",
      "Contrary to his expectations , he found the rebellion at an end , yet he\n",
      "posted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city . As\n",
      "it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to\n",
      "him , he sought him out , and without saying anything on his own behalf ,\n",
      "for he did not recognize any need for doing so , he begged Castruccio to\n",
      "pardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth , their\n",
      "former friendships , and the obligations which Castruccio was under to\n",
      "their house . To this Castruccio graciously responded , and begged\n",
      "Stefano to reassure himself , declaring that it gave him more pleasure\n",
      "to find the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to\n",
      "hear of its inception . He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to\n",
      "him , saying that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of\n",
      "showing his clemency and liberality . Upon the word of Stefano and\n",
      "Castruccio they surrendered , and with Stefano were immediately thrown\n",
      "into prison and put to death . Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered\n",
      "San Miniato , whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace ,\n",
      "as it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to\n",
      "leave him . He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce ,\n",
      "which they readily entertained , for they were weary of the war , and\n",
      "desirous of getting rid of the expenses of it . A treaty was concluded\n",
      "with them for two years , by which both parties agreed to keep the\n",
      "conquests they had made . Castruccio thus released from this trouble ,\n",
      "turned his attention to affairs in Lucca , and in order that he should\n",
      "not again be subject to the perils from which he had just escaped , he ,\n",
      "under various pretences and reasons , first wiped out all those who by\n",
      "their ambition might aspire to the principality ; not sparing one of\n",
      "them , but depriving them of country and property , and those whom he had\n",
      "in his hands of life also , stating that he had found by experience that\n",
      "none of them were to be trusted . Then for his further security he\n",
      "raised a fortress in Lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom\n",
      "he had killed or hunted out of the state .\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines , and strengthened his\n",
      "position in Lucca , he neglected no opportunity , short of open war , of\n",
      "increasing his importance elsewhere . It appeared to him that if he\n",
      "could get possession of Pistoia , he would have one foot in Florence ,\n",
      "which was his great desire . He , therefore , in various ways made friends\n",
      "with the mountaineers , and worked matters so in Pistoia that both\n",
      "parties confided their secrets to him . Pistoia was divided , as it\n",
      "always had been , into the Bianchi and Neri parties ; the head of the\n",
      "Bianchi was Bastiano di Possente , and of the Neri , Jacopo da Gia . Each\n",
      "of these men held secret communications with Castruccio , and each\n",
      "desired to drive the other out of the city ; and , after many\n",
      "threatenings , they came to blows . Jacopo fortified himself at the\n",
      "Florentine gate , Bastiano at that of the Lucchese side of the city ;\n",
      "both trusted more in Castruccio than in the Florentines , because they\n",
      "believed that Castruccio was far more ready and willing to fight than\n",
      "the Florentines , and they both sent to him for assistance . He gave\n",
      "promises to both , saying to Bastiano that he would come in person , and\n",
      "to Jacopo that he would send his pupil , Pagolo Guinigi . At the\n",
      "appointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa , and went himself\n",
      "direct to Pistoia ; at midnight both of them met outside the city , and\n",
      "both were admitted as friends . Thus the two leaders entered , and at a\n",
      "signal given by Castruccio , one killed Jacopo da Gia , and the other\n",
      "Bastiano di Possente , and both took prisoners or killed the partisans\n",
      "of either faction . Without further opposition Pistoia passed into the\n",
      "hands of Castruccio , who , having forced the Signoria to leave the\n",
      "palace , compelled the people to yield obedience to him , making them\n",
      "many promises and remitting their old debts . The countryside flocked to\n",
      "the city to see the new prince , and all were filled with hope and\n",
      "quickly settled down , influenced in a great measure by his great\n",
      "valour .\n",
      "\n",
      "About this time great disturbances arose in Rome , owing to the dearness\n",
      "of living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon .\n",
      "The German governor , Enrico , was much blamed for what happened—murders\n",
      "and tumults following each other daily , without his being able to put\n",
      "an end to them . This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should\n",
      "call in Ruberto , the King of Naples , who would drive the Germans out of\n",
      "the city , and bring back the Pope . Having no nearer friend to whom he\n",
      "could apply for help than Castruccio , he sent to him , begging him not\n",
      "only to give him assistance , but also to come in person to Rome .\n",
      "Castruccio considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the\n",
      "emperor this service , because he believed that he himself would not be\n",
      "safe if at any time the emperor ceased to hold Rome . Leaving Pagolo\n",
      "Guinigi in command at Lucca , Castruccio set out for Rome with six\n",
      "hundred horsemen , where he was received by Enrico with the greatest\n",
      "distinction . In a short time the presence of Castruccio obtained such\n",
      "respect for the emperor that , without bloodshed or violence , good order\n",
      "was restored , chiefly by reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from\n",
      "the country round Pisa large quantities of corn , and thus removed the\n",
      "source of the trouble . When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders ,\n",
      "and admonished others , voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico .\n",
      "Castruccio received many honours , and was made a Roman senator . This\n",
      "dignity was assumed with the greatest pomp , Castruccio being clothed in\n",
      "a brocaded toga , which had the following words embroidered on its\n",
      "front : “ I am what God wills. ” Whilst on the back was : “ What God desires\n",
      "shall be . ”\n",
      "\n",
      "During this time the Florentines , who were much enraged that Castruccio\n",
      "should have seized Pistoia during the truce , considered how they could\n",
      "tempt the city to rebel , to do which they thought would not be\n",
      "difficult in his absence . Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were\n",
      "Baldo Cecchi and Jacopo Baldini , both men of leading and ready to face\n",
      "danger . These men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia ,\n",
      "and with the aid of the Florentines entered the city by night , and\n",
      "after driving out some of Castruccio ’ s officials and partisans , and\n",
      "killing others , they restored the city to its freedom . The news of this\n",
      "greatly angered Castruccio , and taking leave of Enrico , he pressed on\n",
      "in great haste to Pistoia . When the Florentines heard of his return ,\n",
      "knowing that he would lose no time , they decided to intercept him with\n",
      "their forces in the Val di Nievole , under the belief that by doing so\n",
      "they would cut off his road to Pistoia . Assembling a great army of the\n",
      "supporters of the Guelph cause , the Florentines entered the Pistoian\n",
      "territories . On the other hand , Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his\n",
      "army ; and having heard where the Florentines ’ lay , he decided not to\n",
      "encounter it in the plains of Pistoia , nor to await it in the plains of\n",
      "Pescia , but , as far as he possibly could , to attack it boldly in the\n",
      "Pass of Serravalle . He believed that if he succeeded in this design ,\n",
      "victory was assured , although he was informed that the Florentines had\n",
      "thirty thousand men , whilst he had only twelve thousand . Although he\n",
      "had every confidence in his own abilities and the valour of his troops ,\n",
      "yet he hesitated to attack his enemy in the open lest he should be\n",
      "overwhelmed by numbers . Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and\n",
      "Pistoia , situated on a hill which blocks the Val di Nievole , not in the\n",
      "exact pass , but about a bowshot beyond ; the pass itself is in places\n",
      "narrow and steep , whilst in general it ascends gently , but is still\n",
      "narrow , especially at the summit where the waters divide , so that\n",
      "twenty men side by side could hold it . The lord of Serravalle was\n",
      "Manfred , a German , who , before Castruccio became lord of Pistoia , had\n",
      "been allowed to remain in possession of the castle , it being common to\n",
      "the Lucchese and the Pistoians , and unclaimed by either—neither of them\n",
      "wishing to displace Manfred as long as he kept his promise of\n",
      "neutrality , and came under obligations to no one . For these reasons ,\n",
      "and also because the castle was well fortified , he had always been able\n",
      "to maintain his position . It was here that Castruccio had determined to\n",
      "fall upon his enemy , for here his few men would have the advantage , and\n",
      "there was no fear lest , seeing the large masses of the hostile force\n",
      "before they became engaged , they should not stand . As soon as this\n",
      "trouble with Florence arose , Castruccio saw the immense advantage which\n",
      "possession of this castle would give him , and having an intimate\n",
      "friendship with a resident in the castle , he managed matters so with\n",
      "him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted into the castle\n",
      "the night before the attack on the Florentines , and the castellan put\n",
      "to death .\n",
      "\n",
      "Castruccio , having prepared everything , had now to encourage the\n",
      "Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away\n",
      "from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole , therefore he did not move his\n",
      "army from Montecarlo . Thus the Florentines hurried on until they\n",
      "reached their encampment under Serravalle , intending to cross the hill\n",
      "on the following morning . In the meantime , Castruccio had seized the\n",
      "castle at night , had also moved his army from Montecarlo , and marching\n",
      "from thence at midnight in dead silence , had reached the foot of\n",
      "Serravalle : thus he and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the\n",
      "hill at the same time in the morning . Castruccio sent forward his\n",
      "infantry by the main road , and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a\n",
      "path on the left towards the castle . The Florentines sent forward four\n",
      "hundred cavalry ahead of their army which was following , never\n",
      "expecting to find Castruccio in possession of the hill , nor were they\n",
      "aware of his having seized the castle . Thus it happened that the\n",
      "Florentine horsemen mounting the hill were completely taken by surprise\n",
      "when they discovered the infantry of Castruccio , and so close were they\n",
      "upon it they had scarcely time to pull down their visors . It was a case\n",
      "of unready soldiers being attacked by ready , and they were assailed\n",
      "with such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own ,\n",
      "although some few of them got through . When the noise of the fighting\n",
      "reached the Florentine camp below , it was filled with confusion . The\n",
      "cavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed : the captains were\n",
      "unable to get their men either backward or forward , owing to the\n",
      "narrowness of the pass , and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought\n",
      "to be done or what could be done . In a short time the cavalry who were\n",
      "engaged with the enemy ’ s infantry were scattered or killed without\n",
      "having made any effective defence because of their unfortunate\n",
      "position , although in sheer desperation they had offered a stout\n",
      "resistance . Retreat had been impossible , with the mountains on both\n",
      "flanks , whilst in front were their enemies , and in the rear their\n",
      "friends . When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a\n",
      "decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight , he sent one thousand\n",
      "infantrymen round by the castle , with orders to join the four hundred\n",
      "horsemen he had previously dispatched there , and commanded the whole\n",
      "force to fall upon the flank of the enemy . These orders they carried\n",
      "out with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack ,\n",
      "but gave way , and were soon in full retreat—conquered more by their\n",
      "unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy . Those in the\n",
      "rear turned towards Pistoia , and spread through the plains , each man\n",
      "seeking only his own safety . The defeat was complete and very\n",
      "sanguinary . Many captains were taken prisoners , among whom were Bandini\n",
      "dei Rossi , Francesco Brunelleschi , and Giovanni della Tosa , all\n",
      "Florentine noblemen , with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on\n",
      "the Florentine side , having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the\n",
      "Guelphs . Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out\n",
      "the friends of the Guelphs , and surrendered to Castruccio . He was not\n",
      "content with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both\n",
      "sides of the Arno , but marched his army into the plain of Peretola ,\n",
      "about two miles from Florence . Here he remained many days , dividing the\n",
      "spoils , and celebrating his victory with feasts and games , holding\n",
      "horse races , and foot races for men and women . He also struck medals in\n",
      "commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines . He endeavoured to\n",
      "corrupt some of the citizens of Florence , who were to open the city\n",
      "gates at night ; but the conspiracy was discovered , and the\n",
      "participators in it taken and beheaded , among whom were Tommaso Lupacci\n",
      "and Lambertuccio Frescobaldi . This defeat caused the Florentines great\n",
      "anxiety , and despairing of preserving their liberty , they sent envoys\n",
      "to King Ruberto of Naples , offering him the dominion of their city ; and\n",
      "he , knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph\n",
      "cause was to him , accepted it . He agreed with the Florentines to\n",
      "receive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins , and\n",
      "he sent his son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen .\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the\n",
      "pressure of Castruccio ’ s army , owing to his being compelled to leave\n",
      "his positions before Florence and march on Pisa , in order to suppress a\n",
      "conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi ,\n",
      "one of the first men in Pisa , who could not endure that his fatherland\n",
      "should be under the dominion of the Lucchese . He had formed this\n",
      "conspiracy , intending to seize the citadel , kill the partisans of\n",
      "Castruccio , and drive out the garrison . As , however , in a conspiracy\n",
      "paucity of numbers is essential to secrecy , so for its execution a few\n",
      "are not sufficient , and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy\n",
      "Lanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio .\n",
      "This betrayal can not be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio\n",
      "Cerchi and Giovanni Guidi , two Florentine exiles who were suffering\n",
      "their banishment in Pisa . Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put\n",
      "him to death , and beheaded many other noble citizens , and drove their\n",
      "families into exile . It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and\n",
      "Pistoia were thoroughly disaffected ; he employed much thought and\n",
      "energy upon securing his position there , and this gave the Florentines\n",
      "their opportunity to reorganize their army , and to await the coming of\n",
      "Carlo , the son of the King of Naples . When Carlo arrived they decided\n",
      "to lose no more time , and assembled a great army of more than thirty\n",
      "thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry—having called to their aid\n",
      "every Guelph there was in Italy . They consulted whether they should\n",
      "attack Pistoia or Pisa first , and decided that it would be better to\n",
      "march on the latter—a course , owing to the recent conspiracy , more\n",
      "likely to succeed , and of more advantage to them , because they believed\n",
      "that the surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa .\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early part of May 1328 , the Florentines put in motion this army\n",
      "and quickly occupied Lastra , Signa , Montelupo , and Empoli , passing from\n",
      "thence on to San Miniato . When Castruccio heard of the enormous army\n",
      "which the Florentines were sending against him , he was in no degree\n",
      "alarmed , believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would\n",
      "deliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands , for he had no reason to\n",
      "think that his enemy would make a better fight , or had better prospects\n",
      "of success , than at Pisa or Serravalle . He assembled twenty thousand\n",
      "foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen , and with this army went to\n",
      "Fucecchio , whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand\n",
      "infantry . Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in the\n",
      "Pisan district , owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and\n",
      "Gusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain .\n",
      "Moreover , the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they\n",
      "divided their forces , nor could they approach it either from the\n",
      "direction of Lucca or Pisa , nor could they get through to Pisa , or\n",
      "attack Castruccio ’ s forces except at a disadvantage . In one case they\n",
      "would find themselves placed between his two armies , the one under his\n",
      "own command and the other under Pagolo , and in the other case they\n",
      "would have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy ,\n",
      "an undertaking of great hazard . In order to tempt the Florentines to\n",
      "take this latter course , Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of\n",
      "the river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio , leaving a wide\n",
      "expanse of land between them and the river .\n",
      "\n",
      "The Florentines , having occupied San Miniato , held a council of war to\n",
      "decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio , and ,\n",
      "having weighed the difficulties of both courses , they decided upon the\n",
      "latter . The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable , yet\n",
      "the water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the\n",
      "saddles of the horsemen . On the morning of 10 June 1328 , the\n",
      "Florentines commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of\n",
      "cavalry and ten thousand infantry . Castruccio , whose plan of action was\n",
      "fixed , and who well knew what to do , at once attacked the Florentines\n",
      "with five thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen , not allowing\n",
      "them to issue from the river before he charged them ; he also sent one\n",
      "thousand light infantry up the river bank , and the same number down the\n",
      "Arno . The infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their\n",
      "arms and the water that they were not able to mount the banks of the\n",
      "river , whilst the cavalry had made the passage of the river more\n",
      "difficult for the others , by reason of the few who had crossed having\n",
      "broken up the bed of the river , and this being deep with mud , many of\n",
      "the horses rolled over with their riders and many of them had stuck so\n",
      "fast that they could not move . When the Florentine captains saw the\n",
      "difficulties their men were meeting , they withdrew them and moved\n",
      "higher up the river , hoping to find the river bed less treacherous and\n",
      "the banks more adapted for landing . These men were met at the bank by\n",
      "the forces which Castruccio had already sent forward , who , being light\n",
      "armed with bucklers and javelins in their hands , let fly with\n",
      "tremendous shouts into the faces and bodies of the cavalry . The horses ,\n",
      "alarmed by the noise and the wounds , would not move forward , and\n",
      "trampled each other in great confusion . The fight between the men of\n",
      "Castruccio and those of the enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp\n",
      "and terrible ; both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither\n",
      "would yield . The soldiers of Castruccio fought to drive the others back\n",
      "into the river , whilst the Florentines strove to get a footing on land\n",
      "in order to make room for the others pressing forward , who if they\n",
      "could but get out of the water would be able to fight , and in this\n",
      "obstinate conflict they were urged on by their captains . Castruccio\n",
      "shouted to his men that these were the same enemies whom they had\n",
      "before conquered at Serravalle , whilst the Florentines reproached each\n",
      "other that the many should be overcome by the few . At length\n",
      "Castruccio , seeing how long the battle had lasted , and that both his\n",
      "men and the enemy were utterly exhausted , and that both sides had many\n",
      "killed and wounded , pushed forward another body of infantry to take up\n",
      "a position at the rear of those who were fighting ; he then commanded\n",
      "these latter to open their ranks as if they intended to retreat , and\n",
      "one part of them to turn to the right and another to the left . This\n",
      "cleared a space of which the Florentines at once took advantage , and\n",
      "thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield . But when these\n",
      "tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with Castruccio ’ s\n",
      "reserves they could not stand against them and at once fell back into\n",
      "the river . The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained any\n",
      "decisive advantage over the other , because Castruccio , knowing his\n",
      "inferiority in this arm , had commanded his leaders only to stand on the\n",
      "defensive against the attacks of their adversaries , as he hoped that\n",
      "when he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work\n",
      "of the cavalry . This fell out as he had hoped , for when he saw the\n",
      "Florentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder\n",
      "of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy . This they did with\n",
      "lance and javelin , and , joined by their own cavalry , fell upon the\n",
      "enemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight . The Florentine\n",
      "captains , having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in\n",
      "crossing the river , had attempted to make their infantry cross lower\n",
      "down the river , in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio ’ s army . But\n",
      "here , also , the banks were steep and already lined by the men of\n",
      "Castruccio , and this movement was quite useless . Thus the Florentines\n",
      "were so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them\n",
      "escaped , and Castruccio was again covered with glory . Many captains\n",
      "were taken prisoners , and Carlo , the son of King Ruberto , with\n",
      "Michelagnolo Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi , the Florentine\n",
      "commissioners , fled to Empoli . If the spoils were great , the slaughter\n",
      "was infinitely greater , as might be expected in such a battle . Of the\n",
      "Florentines there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men ,\n",
      "whilst Castruccio lost one thousand five hundred and seventy men .\n",
      "\n",
      "But Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his\n",
      "life just at the time when she should have preserved it , and thus\n",
      "ruined all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry\n",
      "into effect , and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but\n",
      "death could have stopped him . Castruccio was in the thick of the battle\n",
      "the whole of the day ; and when the end of it came , although fatigued\n",
      "and overheated , he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on\n",
      "their return from victory and personally thank them . He was also on the\n",
      "watch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day ;\n",
      "he being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be\n",
      "the first man in the saddle and the last out of it . Here Castruccio\n",
      "stood exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the\n",
      "Arno , and which is often very unhealthy ; from this he took a chill , of\n",
      "which he thought nothing , as he was accustomed to such troubles ; but it\n",
      "was the cause of his death . On the following night he was attacked with\n",
      "high fever , which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must\n",
      "prove fatal . Castruccio , therefore , called Pagolo Guinigi to him , and\n",
      "addressed him as follows :\n",
      "\n",
      "“ If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the\n",
      "midst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my\n",
      "successes promised , I should have laboured less , and I should have left\n",
      "thee , if a smaller state , at least with fewer enemies and perils ,\n",
      "because I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and\n",
      "Pisa . I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians , nor outraged the\n",
      "Florentines with so many injuries . But I would have made both these\n",
      "peoples my friends , and I should have lived , if no longer , at least\n",
      "more peacefully , and have left you a state without a doubt smaller , but\n",
      "one more secure and established on a surer foundation . But Fortune , who\n",
      "insists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs , did not endow me\n",
      "with sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first , nor the time\n",
      "to surmount it . Thou hast heard , for many have told thee , and I have\n",
      "never concealed it , how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a\n",
      "boy—a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should\n",
      "feel—and how I was brought up by him , and loved as though I had been\n",
      "born of his blood ; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and\n",
      "capable of availing myself of all that fortune , of which thou hast been\n",
      "witness . When thy good father came to die , he committed thee and all\n",
      "his possessions to my care , and I have brought thee up with that love ,\n",
      "and increased thy estate with that care , which I was bound to show . And\n",
      "in order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy\n",
      "father left , but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained ,\n",
      "I have never married , so that the love of children should never deflect\n",
      "my mind from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father .\n",
      "Thus I leave thee a vast estate , of which I am well content , but I am\n",
      "deeply concerned , inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure .\n",
      "Thou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands , which will never rest\n",
      "contented under thy government . Thou hast also Pisa , where the men are\n",
      "of nature changeable and unreliable , who , although they may be\n",
      "sometimes held in subjection , yet they will ever disdain to serve under\n",
      "a Lucchese . Pistoia is also disloyal to thee , she being eaten up with\n",
      "factions and deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs\n",
      "recently inflicted upon them . Thou hast for neighbours the offended\n",
      "Florentines , injured by us in a thousand ways , but not utterly\n",
      "destroyed , who will hail the news of my death with more delight than\n",
      "they would the acquisition of all Tuscany . In the Emperor and in the\n",
      "princes of Milan thou canst place no reliance , for they are far\n",
      "distant , slow , and their help is very long in coming . Therefore , thou\n",
      "hast no hope in anything but in thine own abilities , and in the memory\n",
      "of my valour , and in the prestige which this latest victory has brought\n",
      "thee ; which , as thou knowest how to use it with prudence , will assist\n",
      "thee to come to terms with the Florentines , who , as they are suffering\n",
      "under this great defeat , should be inclined to listen to thee . And\n",
      "whereas I have sought to make them my enemies , because I believed that\n",
      "war with them would conduce to my power and glory , thou hast every\n",
      "inducement to make friends of them , because their alliance will bring\n",
      "thee advantages and security . It is of the greatest important in this\n",
      "world that a man should know himself , and the measure of his own\n",
      "strength and means ; and he who knows that he has not a genius for\n",
      "fighting must learn how to govern by the arts of peace . And it will be\n",
      "well for thee to rule thy conduct by my counsel , and to learn in this\n",
      "way to enjoy what my life-work and dangers have gained ; and in this\n",
      "thou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to believe that what I\n",
      "have told thee is true . And thou wilt be doubly indebted to me , in that\n",
      "I have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it . ”\n",
      "\n",
      "After this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa , Pistoia ,\n",
      "and Lucca , who had been fighting at his side , and whilst recommending\n",
      "Pagolo to them , and making them swear obedience to him as his\n",
      "successor , he died . He left a happy memory to those who had known him ,\n",
      "and no prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he\n",
      "was . His obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning , and he\n",
      "was buried in San Francesco at Lucca . Fortune was not so friendly to\n",
      "Pagolo Guinigi as she had been to Castruccio , for he had not the\n",
      "abilities . Not long after the death of Castruccio , Pagolo lost Pisa ,\n",
      "and then Pistoia , and only with difficulty held on to Lucca . This\n",
      "latter city continued in the family of Guinigi until the time of the\n",
      "great-grandson of Pagolo .\n",
      "\n",
      "From what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a\n",
      "man of exceptional abilities , not only measured by men of his own time ,\n",
      "but also by those of an earlier date . In stature he was above the\n",
      "ordinary height , and perfectly proportioned . He was of a gracious\n",
      "presence , and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke\n",
      "with him rarely left him displeased . His hair was inclined to be red ,\n",
      "and he wore it cut short above the ears , and , whether it rained or\n",
      "snowed , he always went without a hat . He was delightful among friends ,\n",
      "but terrible to his enemies ; just to his subjects ; ready to play false\n",
      "with the unfaithful , and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he\n",
      "desired to subdue , because he was wont to say that it was the victory\n",
      "that brought the glory , not the methods of achieving it . No one was\n",
      "bolder in facing danger , none more prudent in extricating himself . He\n",
      "was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear\n",
      "nothing ; that God is a lover of strong men , because one always sees\n",
      "that the weak are chastised by the strong . He was also wonderfully\n",
      "sharp or biting though courteous in his answers ; and as he did not look\n",
      "for any indulgence in this way of speaking from others , so he was not\n",
      "angered with others did not show it to him . It has often happened that\n",
      "he has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him , as on\n",
      "the following occasions . He had caused a ducat to be given for a\n",
      "partridge , and was taken to task for doing so by a friend , to whom\n",
      "Castruccio had said : “ You would not have given more than a penny . ”\n",
      "“ That is true , ” answered the friend . Then said Castruccio to him : “ A\n",
      "ducat is much less to me. ” Having about him a flatterer on whom he had\n",
      "spat to show that he scorned him , the flatterer said to him : “ Fisherman\n",
      "are willing to let the waters of the sea saturate them in order that\n",
      "they may take a few little fishes , and I allow myself to be wetted by\n",
      "spittle that I may catch a whale ” ; and this was not only heard by\n",
      "Castruccio with patience but rewarded . When told by a priest that it\n",
      "was wicked for him to live so sumptuously , Castruccio said : “ If that be\n",
      "a vice then you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our\n",
      "saints. ” Passing through a street he saw a young man as he came out of\n",
      "a house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio , and said to him :\n",
      "“ Thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out , but when thou goest\n",
      "into such places. ” A friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo\n",
      "and was told : “ Fool , do you think that I wish to untie a thing which\n",
      "gave so much trouble to fasten. ” Castruccio said to one who professed\n",
      "to be a philosopher : “ You are like the dogs who always run after those\n",
      "who will give them the best to eat , ” and was answered : “ We are rather\n",
      "like the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest\n",
      "need of them. ” Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn , Castruccio was much\n",
      "disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up , and was reproached for\n",
      "cowardice by one of those with him , who said that he did not fear\n",
      "anything . Castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that , since\n",
      "every man valued his soul for what is was worth . Being asked by one\n",
      "what he ought to do to gain estimation , he said : “ When thou goest to a\n",
      "banquet take care that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon\n",
      "another. ” To a person who was boasting that he had read many things ,\n",
      "Castruccio said : “ He knows better than to boast of remembering many\n",
      "things. ” Someone bragged that he could drink much without becoming\n",
      "intoxicated . Castruccio replied : “ An ox does the same. ” Castruccio was\n",
      "acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate relations , and being\n",
      "blamed by a friend who told him that it was undignified for him to be\n",
      "taken in by a woman , he said : “ She has not taken me in , I have taken\n",
      "her. ” Being also blamed for eating very dainty foods , he answered :\n",
      "“ Thou dost not spend as much as I do ? ” and being told that it was true ,\n",
      "he continued : “ Then thou art more avaricious than I am gluttonous . ”\n",
      "Being invited by Taddeo Bernardi , a very rich and splendid citizen of\n",
      "Luca , to supper , he went to the house and was shown by Taddeo into a\n",
      "chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones representing flowers\n",
      "and foliage of the most beautiful colouring . Castruccio gathered some\n",
      "saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon Taddeo , and seeing him much\n",
      "disturbed by this , said to him : “ I knew not where to spit in order to\n",
      "offend thee less. ” Being asked how Caesar died he said : “ God willing I\n",
      "will die as he did. ” Being one night in the house of one of his\n",
      "gentlemen where many ladies were assembled , he was reproved by one of\n",
      "his friends for dancing and amusing himself with them more than was\n",
      "usual in one of his station , so he said : “ He who is considered wise by\n",
      "day will not be considered a fool at night. ” A person came to demand a\n",
      "favour of Castruccio , and thinking he was not listening to his plea\n",
      "threw himself on his knees to the ground , and being sharply reproved by\n",
      "Castruccio , said : “ Thou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast\n",
      "thy ears in thy feet , ” whereupon he obtained double the favour he had\n",
      "asked . Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy one ,\n",
      "seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled\n",
      "blindfolded . Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous\n",
      "words , he said to him : “ When you have another request to make , send\n",
      "someone else to make it. ” Having been wearied by a similar man with a\n",
      "long oration who wound up by saying : “ Perhaps I have fatigued you by\n",
      "speaking so long , ” Castruccio said : “ You have not , because I have not\n",
      "listened to a word you said. ” He used to say of one who had been a\n",
      "beautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man , that he was\n",
      "dangerous , because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he\n",
      "took the wives from their husbands . To an envious man who laughed , he\n",
      "said : “ Do you laugh because you are successful or because another is\n",
      "unfortunate ? ” Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco\n",
      "Guinigi , one of his companions said to him : “ What shall I give you if\n",
      "you will let me give you a blow on the nose ? ” Castruccio answered : “ A\n",
      "helmet. ” Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been\n",
      "instrumental in raising him to power , and being told that he had done\n",
      "wrong to kill one of his old friends , he answered that people deceived\n",
      "themselves ; he had only killed a new enemy . Castruccio praised greatly\n",
      "those men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so , saying\n",
      "that they were like men who said they would go to sea , and then refused\n",
      "when the time came . He said that it always struck him with surprise\n",
      "that whilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first\n",
      "to learn if it were good , yet in choosing a wife they were content with\n",
      "only looking at her . He was once asked in what manner he would wish to\n",
      "be buried when he died , and answered : “ With the face turned downwards ,\n",
      "for I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down. ” On\n",
      "being asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order\n",
      "to save his soul , he answered that it had not , because it appeared\n",
      "strange to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione\n",
      "della Faggiuola to the Inferno . He was once asked when should a man eat\n",
      "to preserve his health , and replied : “ If the man be rich let him eat\n",
      "when he is hungry ; if he be poor , then when he can. ” Seeing one of his\n",
      "gentlemen make a member of his family lace him up , he said to him : “ I\n",
      "pray God that you will let him feed you also. ” Seeing that someone had\n",
      "written upon his house in Latin the words : “ May God preserve this house\n",
      "from the wicked , ” he said , “ The owner must never go in. ” Passing\n",
      "through one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door ,\n",
      "and remarked : “ That house will fly through the door. ” He was having a\n",
      "discussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning the\n",
      "property of some banished nobles , when a dispute arose between them ,\n",
      "and the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king . “ Is this\n",
      "king of yours a bad man or a good one ? ” asked Castruccio , and was told\n",
      "that he was a good one , whereupon he said , “ Why should you suggest that\n",
      "I should be afraid of a good man ? ”\n",
      "\n",
      "I could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and\n",
      "weighty , but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony to his\n",
      "high qualities . He lived forty-four years , and was in every way a\n",
      "prince . And as he was surrounded by many evidences of his good fortune ,\n",
      "so he also desired to have near him some memorials of his bad fortune ;\n",
      "therefore the manacles with which he was chained in prison are to be\n",
      "seen to this day fixed up in the tower of his residence , where they\n",
      "were placed by him to testify forever to his days of adversity . As in\n",
      "his life he was inferior neither to Philip of Macedon , the father of\n",
      "Alexander , nor to Scipio of Rome , so he died in the same year of his\n",
      "age as they did , and he would doubtless have excelled both of them had\n",
      "Fortune decreed that he should be born , not in Lucca , but in Macedonia\n",
      "or Rome .\n",

      "CHAPTER I . HOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE , AND BY WHAT MEANS THEY ARE ACQUIRED All states , powers , held hold rule men either republics principalities . Principalities either hereditary , family long established ; new . The new either entirely new , Milan Francesco Sforza , , , members annexed hereditary state prince acquired , kingdom Naples King Spain . Such dominions thus acquired either accustomed live prince , live freedom ; acquired either arms prince , others , else fortune ability . CHAPTER II . CONCERNING HEREDITARY PRINCIPALITIES I leave discussion republics , inasmuch another place I written length , address principalities . In I keep order indicated , discuss principalities ruled preserved . I say fewer difficulties holding hereditary states , long accustomed family prince , new ones ; sufficient transgress customs ancestors , deal prudently circumstances arise , prince average powers maintain state , unless deprived extraordinary excessive force ; deprived , whenever anything sinister happens usurper , regain . We Italy , example , Duke Ferrara , could withstood attacks Venetians ’ 84 , Pope Julius ’ 10 , unless long established dominions . For hereditary prince less cause less necessity offend ; hence happens loved ; unless extraordinary vices cause hated , reasonable expect subjects naturally well disposed towards ; antiquity duration rule memories motives make change lost , one change always leaves toothing another . CHAPTER III . CONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES But difficulties occur new principality . And firstly , entirely new , , , member state , taken collectively , may called composite , changes arise chiefly inherent difficulty new principalities ; men change rulers willingly , hoping better , hope induces take arms rules : wherein deceived , afterwards find experience gone bad worse . This follows also another natural common necessity , always causes new prince burden submitted soldiery infinite hardships must put upon new acquisition . In way enemies injured seizing principality , able keep friends put able satisfy way expected , take strong measures , feeling bound . For , although one may strong armed forces , yet entering province one always need goodwill natives . For reasons Louis Twelfth , King France , quickly occupied Milan , quickly lost ; turn first time needed Lodovico ’ forces ; opened gates , finding deceived hopes future benefit , would endure ill-treatment new prince . It true , acquiring rebellious provinces second time , lightly lost afterwards , prince , little reluctance , takes opportunity rebellion punish delinquents , clear suspects , strengthen weakest places . Thus cause France lose Milan first time enough Duke Lodovico [ 1 ] raise insurrections borders ; cause lose second time necessary bring whole world , armies defeated driven Italy ; followed causes mentioned . [ 1 ] Duke Lodovico Lodovico Moro , son Francesco Sforza , married Beatrice ’ Este . He ruled Milan 1494 1500 , died 1510 . Nevertheless Milan taken France first second time . The general reasons first discussed ; remains name second , see resources , one situation would maintaining securely acquisition King France . Now I say dominions , acquired , added ancient state acquires , either country language , . When , easier hold , especially accustomed self-government ; hold securely enough destroyed family prince ruling ; two peoples , preserving things old conditions , unlike customs , live quietly together , one seen Brittany , Burgundy , Gascony , Normandy , bound France long time : , although may difference language , nevertheless customs alike , people easily able get amongst . He annexed , wishes hold , bear mind two considerations : one , family former lord extinguished ; , neither laws taxes altered , short time become entirely one body old principality . But states acquired country differing language , customs , laws , difficulties , good fortune great energy needed hold , one greatest real helps would acquired go reside . This would make position secure durable , made Turk Greece , , notwithstanding measures taken holding state , settled , would able keep . Because , one spot , disorders seen spring , one quickly remedy ; one hand , heard great , one longer remedy . Besides , country pillaged officials ; subjects satisfied prompt recourse prince ; thus , wishing good , cause love , wishing otherwise , fear . He would attack state outside must utmost caution ; long prince resides wrested greatest difficulty . The better course send colonies one two places , may keys state , necessary either else keep great number cavalry infantry . A prince spend much colonies , little expense send keep , offends minority citizens takes lands houses give new inhabitants ; offends , remaining poor scattered , never able injure ; whilst rest uninjured easily kept quiet , time anxious err fear happen despoiled . In conclusion , I say colonies costly , faithful , injure less , injured , said , poor scattered , hurt . Upon , one remark men ought either well treated crushed , avenge lighter injuries , serious ones ; therefore injury done man ought kind one stand fear revenge . But maintaining armed men place colonies one spends much , consume garrison income state , acquisition turns loss , many exasperated , whole state injured ; shifting garrison become acquainted hardship , become hostile , enemies , whilst beaten ground , yet able hurt . For every reason , therefore , guards useless colony useful . Again , prince holds country differing respects ought make head defender less powerful neighbours , weaken powerful amongst , taking care foreigner powerful shall , accident , get footing ; always happen one introduced discontented , either excess ambition fear , one seen already . The Romans brought Greece Ætolians ; every country obtained footing brought inhabitants . And usual course affairs , soon powerful foreigner enters country , subject states drawn , moved hatred feel ruling power . So respect subject states take trouble gain , whole quickly rally state acquired . He take care get hold much power much authority , forces , goodwill , easily keep powerful , remain entirely master country . And properly manage business soon lose acquired , whilst hold endless difficulties troubles . The Romans , countries annexed , observed closely measures ; sent colonies maintained friendly relations [ 2 ] minor powers , without increasing strength ; kept greater , allow strong foreign powers gain authority . Greece appears sufficient example . The Achaeans Ætolians kept friendly , kingdom Macedonia humbled , Antiochus driven ; yet merits Achaeans Ætolians never secured permission increase power , persuasions Philip ever induce Romans friends without first humbling , influence Antiochus make agree retain lordship country . Because Romans instances prudent princes ought , regard present troubles , also future ones , must prepare every energy , , foreseen , easy remedy ; wait approach , medicine longer time malady become incurable ; happens , physicians say happens hectic fever , beginning malady easy cure difficult detect , course time , either detected treated beginning , becomes easy detect difficult cure . Thus happens affairs state , evils arise foreseen ( given wise man see ) , quickly redressed , , foreseen , permitted grow way every one see , longer remedy . Therefore , Romans , foreseeing troubles , dealt , , even avoid war , would let come head , knew war avoided , put advantage others ; moreover wished fight Philip Antiochus Greece Italy ; could avoided , wish ; ever please forever mouths wise ones time : —Let us enjoy benefits time—but rather benefits valour prudence , time drives everything , able bring good well evil , evil well good . [ 2 ] See remark introduction word “ intrattenere . ” But let us turn France inquire whether done things mentioned . I speak Louis [ 3 ] ( Charles ) [ 4 ] one whose conduct better observed , held possession Italy longest period ; see done opposite things ought done retain state composed divers elements . [ 3 ] Louis XII , King France , “ The Father People , ” born 1462 , died 1515 . [ 4 ] Charles VIII , King France , born 1470 , died 1498 . King Louis brought Italy ambition Venetians , desired obtain half state Lombardy intervention . I blame course taken king , , wishing get foothold Italy , friends there—seeing rather every door shut owing conduct Charles—he forced accept friendships could get , would succeeded quickly design matters made mistakes . The king , however , acquired Lombardy , regained authority Charles lost : Genoa yielded ; Florentines became friends ; Marquess Mantua , Duke Ferrara , Bentivogli , lady Forli , Lords Faenza , Pesaro , Rimini , Camerino , Piombino , Lucchese , Pisans , Sienese—everybody made advances become friend . Then could Venetians realize rashness course taken , , order might secure two towns Lombardy , made king master two-thirds Italy . Let one consider little difficulty king could maintained position Italy observed rules laid , kept friends secure protected ; although numerous weak timid , afraid Church , Venetians , thus would always forced stand , means could easily made secure remained powerful . But sooner Milan contrary assisting Pope Alexander occupy Romagna . It never occurred action weakening , depriving friends thrown lap , whilst aggrandized Church adding much temporal power spiritual , thus giving greater authority . And committed prime error , obliged follow , much , put end ambition Alexander , prevent becoming master Tuscany , forced come Italy . And enough aggrandized Church , deprived friends , , wishing kingdom Naples , divided King Spain , prime arbiter Italy takes associate , ambitious country malcontents somewhere shelter ; whereas could left kingdom pensioner king , drove , put one able drive , Louis , turn . The wish acquire truth natural common , men always , praised blamed ; , yet wish means , folly blame . Therefore , France could attacked Naples forces ought done ; could , ought divided . And partition made Venetians Lombardy justified excuse got foothold Italy , partition merited blame , excuse necessity . Therefore Louis made five errors : destroyed minor powers , increased strength one greater powers Italy , brought foreign power , settle country , send colonies . Which errors , lived , enough injure made sixth taking away dominions Venetians ; , aggrandized Church , brought Spain Italy , would reasonable necessary humble ; first taken steps , ought never consented ruin , , powerful , would always kept others designs Lombardy , Venetians would never consented except become masters ; also others would wish take Lombardy France order give Venetians , run counter would courage . And one say : “ King Louis yielded Romagna Alexander kingdom Spain avoid war , ” I answer reasons given blunder ought never perpetrated avoid war , avoided , deferred disadvantage . And another allege pledge king given Pope would assist enterprise , exchange dissolution marriage [ 5 ] cap Rouen , [ 6 ] I reply I shall write later concerning faith princes , ought kept . [ 5 ] Louis XII divorced wife , Jeanne , daughter Louis XI , married 1499 Anne Brittany , widow Charles VIII , order retain Duchy Brittany crown . [ 6 ] The Archbishop Rouen . He Georges ’ Amboise , created cardinal Alexander VI . Born 1460 , died 1510 . Thus King Louis lost Lombardy followed conditions observed taken possession countries wished retain . Nor miracle , much reasonable quite natural . And matters I spoke Nantes Rouen , Valentino , Cesare Borgia , son Pope Alexander , usually called , occupied Romagna , Cardinal Rouen observing Italians understand war , I replied French understand statecraft , meaning otherwise would allowed Church reach greatness . And fact seen greatness Church Spain Italy caused France , ruin may attributed . From general rule drawn never rarely fails : cause another becoming powerful ruined ; predominancy brought either astuteness else force , distrusted raised power . CHAPTER IV . WHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS , CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER , DID NOT REBEL AGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH Considering difficulties men hold newly acquired state , might wonder , seeing Alexander Great became master Asia years , died whilst scarcely settled ( whence might appear reasonable whole empire would rebelled ) , nevertheless successors maintained , meet difficulty arose among ambitions . I answer principalities one record found governed two different ways ; either prince , body servants , assist govern kingdom ministers favour permission ; prince barons , hold dignity antiquity blood grace prince . Such barons states subjects , recognize lords hold natural affection . Those states governed prince servants hold prince consideration , country one recognized superior , yield obedience another minister official , bear particular affection . The examples two governments time Turk King France . The entire monarchy Turk governed one lord , others servants ; , dividing kingdom sanjaks , sends different administrators , shifts changes chooses . But King France placed midst ancient body lords , acknowledged subjects , beloved ; prerogatives , king take away except peril . Therefore , considers states recognize great difficulties seizing state Turk , , conquered , great ease holding . The causes difficulties seizing kingdom Turk usurper called princes kingdom , hope assisted designs revolt lord around . This arises reasons given ; ministers , slaves bondmen , corrupted great difficulty , one expect little advantage corrupted , carry people , reasons assigned . Hence , attacks Turk must bear mind find united , rely strength revolt others ; , Turk conquered , routed field way replace armies , nothing fear family prince , , exterminated , remains one fear , others credit people ; conqueror rely victory , ought fear . The contrary happens kingdoms governed like France , one easily enter gaining baron kingdom , one always finds malcontents desire change . Such men , reasons given , open way state render victory easy ; wish hold afterwards , meet infinite difficulties , assisted crushed . Nor enough exterminated family prince , lords remain make heads fresh movements , unable either satisfy exterminate , state lost whenever time brings opportunity . Now consider nature government Darius , find similar kingdom Turk , therefore necessary Alexander , first overthrow field , take country . After victory , Darius killed , state remained secure Alexander , reasons . And successors united would enjoyed securely ease , tumults raised kingdom except provoked . But impossible hold tranquillity states constituted like France . Hence arose frequent rebellions Romans Spain , France , Greece , owing many principalities states , , long memory endured , Romans always held insecure possession ; power long continuance empire memory passed away , Romans became secure possessors . And fighting afterwards amongst , one able attach parts country , according authority assumed ; family former lord exterminated , none Romans acknowledged . When things remembered one marvel ease Alexander held Empire Asia , difficulties others keep acquisition , Pyrrhus many ; occasioned little abundance ability conqueror , want uniformity subject state . CHAPTER V . CONCERNING THE WAY TO GOVERN CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH LIVED UNDER THEIR OWN LAWS BEFORE THEY WERE ANNEXED Whenever states acquired stated accustomed live laws freedom , three courses wish hold : first ruin , next reside person , third permit live laws , drawing tribute , establishing within oligarchy keep friendly . Because government , created prince , knows stand without friendship interest , utmost support ; therefore would keep city accustomed freedom hold easily means citizens way . There , example , Spartans Romans . The Spartans held Athens Thebes , establishing oligarchy : nevertheless lost . The Romans , order hold Capua , Carthage , Numantia , dismantled , lose . They wished hold Greece Spartans held , making free permitting laws , succeed . So hold compelled dismantle many cities country , truth safe way retain otherwise ruining . And becomes master city accustomed freedom destroy , may expect destroyed , rebellion always watchword liberty ancient privileges rallying point , neither time benefits ever cause forget . And whatever may provide , never forget name privileges unless disunited dispersed , every chance immediately rally , Pisa hundred years held bondage Florentines . But cities countries accustomed live prince , family exterminated , , one hand accustomed obey hand old prince , agree making one amongst , know govern . For reason slow take arms , prince gain secure much easily . But republics vitality , greater hatred , desire vengeance , never permit allow memory former liberty rest ; safest way destroy reside . CHAPTER VI . CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED BY ONE ’ S OWN ARMS AND ABILITY Let one surprised , speaking entirely new principalities I shall , I adduce highest examples prince state ; men , walking almost always paths beaten others , following imitation deeds , yet unable keep entirely ways others attain power imitate . A wise man ought always follow paths beaten great men , imitate supreme , ability equal , least savour . Let act like clever archers , designing hit mark yet appears far distant , knowing limits strength bow attains , take aim much higher mark , reach strength arrow great height , able aid high aim hit mark wish reach . I say , therefore , entirely new principalities , new prince , less difficulty found keeping , accordingly less ability acquired state . Now , fact becoming prince private station presupposes either ability fortune , clear one things mitigate degree many difficulties . Nevertheless , relied least fortune established strongest . Further , facilitates matters prince , state , compelled reside person . But come , ability fortune , risen princes , I say Moses , Cyrus , Romulus , Theseus , like excellent examples . And although one may discuss Moses , mere executor God , yet ought admired , favour made worthy speak God . But considering Cyrus others acquired founded kingdoms , found admirable ; particular deeds conduct shall considered , found inferior Moses , although great preceptor . And examining actions lives one see owed anything fortune beyond opportunity , brought material mould form seemed best . Without opportunity powers mind would extinguished , without powers opportunity would come vain . It necessary , therefore , Moses find people Israel Egypt enslaved oppressed Egyptians , order disposed follow delivered bondage . It necessary Romulus remain Alba , abandoned birth , order become King Rome founder fatherland . It necessary Cyrus find Persians discontented government Medes , Medes soft effeminate long peace . Theseus could shown ability found Athenians dispersed . These opportunities , therefore , made men fortunate , high ability enabled recognize opportunity whereby country ennobled made famous . Those valorous ways become princes , like men , acquire principality difficulty , keep ease . The difficulties acquiring rise part new rules methods forced introduce establish government security . And ought remembered nothing difficult take hand , perilous conduct , uncertain success , take lead introduction new order things , innovator enemies done well old conditions , lukewarm defenders may well new . This coolness arises partly fear opponents , laws side , partly incredulity men , readily believe new things long experience . Thus happens whenever hostile opportunity attack like partisans , whilst others defend lukewarmly , wise prince endangered along . It necessary , therefore , desire discuss matter thoroughly , inquire whether innovators rely depend others : say , whether , consummate enterprise , use prayers use force ? In first instance always succeed badly , never compass anything ; rely use force , rarely endangered . Hence armed prophets conquered , unarmed ones destroyed . Besides reasons mentioned , nature people variable , whilst easy persuade , difficult fix persuasion . And thus necessary take measures , believe longer , may possible make believe force . If Moses , Cyrus , Theseus , Romulus unarmed could enforced constitutions long—as happened time Fra Girolamo Savonarola , ruined new order things immediately multitude believed longer , means keeping steadfast believed making unbelievers believe . Therefore great difficulties consummating enterprise , dangers ascent , yet ability overcome ; overcome , envied success exterminated , begin respected , continue afterwards powerful , secure , honoured , happy . To great examples I wish add lesser one ; still bears resemblance , I wish suffice like kind : Hiero Syracusan . [ 1 ] This man rose private station Prince Syracuse , , either , owe anything fortune opportunity ; Syracusans , oppressed , chose captain , afterwards rewarded made prince . He great ability , even private citizen , one writes says wanted nothing kingdom king . This man abolished old soldiery , organized new , gave old alliances , made new ones ; soldiers allies , foundations able build edifice : thus , whilst endured much trouble acquiring , little keeping . [ 1 ] Hiero II , born 307 B.C. , died 216 B.C . CHAPTER VII . CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED EITHER BY THE ARMS OF OTHERS OR BY GOOD FORTUNE Those solely good fortune become princes private citizens little trouble rising , much keeping atop ; difficulties way , fly , many reach summit . Such state given either money favour bestows ; happened many Greece , cities Ionia Hellespont , princes made Darius , order might hold cities security glory ; also emperors , corruption soldiers , citizens came empire . Such stand simply elevated upon goodwill fortune elevated them—two inconstant unstable things . Neither knowledge requisite position ; , unless men great worth ability , reasonable expect know command , always lived private condition ; besides , hold forces keep friendly faithful . States rise unexpectedly , , like things nature born grow rapidly , leave foundations correspondencies [ 1 ] fixed way first storm overthrow ; unless , said , unexpectedly become princes men much ability know prepared hold fortune thrown laps , foundations , others laid _before_ became princes , must lay _afterwards_ . [ 1 ] “ Le radici e corrispondenze , ” roots ( i.e . foundations ) correspondencies relations states—a common meaning “ correspondence ” “ correspondency ” sixteenth seventeenth centuries . Concerning two methods rising prince ability fortune , I wish adduce two examples within recollection , Francesco Sforza [ 2 ] Cesare Borgia . Francesco , proper means great ability , private person rose Duke Milan , acquired thousand anxieties kept little trouble . On hand , Cesare Borgia , called people Duke Valentino , acquired state ascendancy father , decline lost , notwithstanding taken every measure done ought done wise able man fix firmly roots states arms fortunes others bestowed . [ 2 ] Francesco Sforza , born 1401 , died 1466 . He married Bianca Maria Visconti , natural daughter Filippo Visconti , Duke Milan , whose death procured elevation duchy . Machiavelli accredited agent Florentine Republic Cesare Borgia ( 1478-1507 ) transactions led assassinations Orsini Vitelli Sinigalia , along letters chiefs Florence left account , written ten years _The Prince_ , proceedings duke “ Descritione del modo tenuto dal duca Valentino nello ammazzare Vitellozzo Vitelli , ” etc. , translation appended present work . Because , stated , first laid foundations may able great ability lay afterwards , laid trouble architect danger building . If , therefore , steps taken duke considered , seen laid solid foundations future power , I consider superfluous discuss , I know better precepts give new prince example actions ; dispositions avail , fault , extraordinary extreme malignity fortune . Alexander Sixth , wishing aggrandize duke , son , many immediate prospective difficulties . Firstly , see way make master state state Church ; willing rob Church knew Duke Milan Venetians would consent , Faenza Rimini already protection Venetians . Besides , saw arms Italy , especially might assisted , hands would fear aggrandizement Pope , namely , Orsini Colonnesi following . It behoved , therefore , upset state affairs embroil powers , make securely master part states . This easy , found Venetians , moved reasons , inclined bring back French Italy ; would oppose , would render easy dissolving former marriage King Louis . Therefore king came Italy assistance Venetians consent Alexander . He sooner Milan Pope soldiers attempt Romagna , yielded reputation king . The duke , therefore , acquired Romagna beaten Colonnesi , wishing hold advance , hindered two things : one , forces appear loyal , , goodwill France : say , feared forces Orsini , using , would stand , might hinder winning , might seize , king might also . Of Orsini warning , taking Faenza attacking Bologna , saw go unwillingly attack . And king , learned mind , taking Duchy Urbino , attacked Tuscany , king made desist undertaking ; hence duke decided depend upon arms luck others . For first thing weakened Orsini Colonnesi parties Rome , gaining adherents gentlemen , making gentlemen , giving good pay , , according rank , honouring office command way months attachment factions destroyed turned entirely duke . After awaited opportunity crush Orsini , scattered adherents Colonna house . This came soon used well ; Orsini , perceiving length aggrandizement duke Church ruin , called meeting Magione Perugia . From sprung rebellion Urbino tumults Romagna , endless dangers duke , overcame help French . Having restored authority , leave risk trusting either French outside forces , recourse wiles , knew well conceal mind , mediation Signor Pagolo—whom duke fail secure kinds attention , giving money , apparel , horses—the Orsini reconciled , simplicity brought power Sinigalia . [ 3 ] Having exterminated leaders , turned partisans friends , duke laid sufficiently good foundations power , Romagna Duchy Urbino ; people beginning appreciate prosperity , gained . And point worthy notice , imitated others , I willing leave . [ 3 ] Sinigalia , 31st December 1502 . When duke occupied Romagna found rule weak masters , rather plundered subjects ruled , gave cause disunion union , country full robbery , quarrels , every kind violence ; , wishing bring back peace obedience authority , considered necessary give good governor . Thereupon promoted Messer Ramiro ’ Orco , [ 4 ] swift cruel man , gave fullest power . This man short time restored peace unity greatest success . Afterwards duke considered advisable confer excessive authority , doubt would become odious , set court judgment country , excellent president , wherein cities advocates . And knew past severity caused hatred , , clear minds people , gain entirely , desired show , cruelty practised , originated , natural sternness minister . Under pretence took Ramiro , one morning caused executed left piazza Cesena block bloody knife side . The barbarity spectacle caused people satisfied dismayed . [ 4 ] Ramiro ’ Orco . Ramiro de Lorqua . But let us return whence started . I say duke , finding sufficiently powerful partly secured immediate dangers armed way , great measure crushed forces vicinity could injure wished proceed conquest , next consider France , knew king , late aware mistake , would support . And time began seek new alliances temporize France expedition making towards kingdom Naples Spaniards besieging Gaeta . It intention secure , would quickly accomplished Alexander lived . Such line action present affairs . But future fear , first place , new successor Church might friendly might seek take Alexander given , decided act four ways . Firstly , exterminating families lords despoiled , take away pretext Pope . Secondly , winning gentlemen Rome , able curb Pope aid , observed . Thirdly , converting college . Fourthly , acquiring much power Pope die could measures resist first shock . Of four things , death Alexander , accomplished three . For killed many dispossessed lords could lay hands , escaped ; Roman gentlemen , numerous party college . And fresh acquisition , intended become master Tuscany , already possessed Perugia Piombino , Pisa protection . And longer study France ( French already driven kingdom Naples Spaniards , way compelled buy goodwill ) , pounced upon Pisa . After , Lucca Siena yielded , partly hatred partly fear Florentines ; Florentines would remedy continued prosper , prospering year Alexander died , acquired much power reputation would stood , longer depended luck forces others , solely power ability . But Alexander died five years first drawn sword . He left duke state Romagna alone consolidated , rest air , two powerful hostile armies , sick unto death . Yet duke boldness ability , knew well men lost , firm foundations short time laid , armies back , good health , would overcome difficulties . And seen foundations good , Romagna awaited month . In Rome , although half alive , remained secure ; whilst Baglioni , Vitelli , Orsini might come Rome , could effect anything . If could made Pope wished , least one wish would elected . But sound health death Alexander , [ 5 ] everything would different . On day Julius Second [ 6 ] elected , told thought everything might occur death father , provided remedy , except never anticipated , death happen , would point die . [ 5 ] Alexander VI died fever , 18th August 1503 . [ 6 ] Julius II Giuliano della Rovere , Cardinal San Pietro ad Vincula , born 1443 , died 1513 . When actions duke recalled , I know blame , rather appears , I said , I ought offer imitation , fortune arms others , raised government . Because , lofty spirit far-reaching aims , could regulated conduct otherwise , shortness life Alexander sickness frustrated designs . Therefore , considers necessary secure new principality , win friends , overcome either force fraud , make beloved feared people , followed revered soldiers , exterminate power reason hurt , change old order things new , severe gracious , magnanimous liberal , destroy disloyal soldiery create new , maintain friendship kings princes way must help zeal offend caution , find lively example actions man . Only blamed election Julius Second , made bad choice , , said , able elect Pope mind , could hindered elected Pope ; ought never consented election cardinal injured cause fear became pontiffs . For men injure either fear hatred . Those injured , amongst others , San Pietro ad Vincula , Colonna , San Giorgio , Ascanio . [ 7 ] The rest , becoming Pope , fear , Rouen Spaniards excepted ; latter relationship obligations , former influence , kingdom France relations . Therefore , everything , duke ought created Spaniard Pope , , failing , ought consented Rouen San Pietro ad Vincula . He believes new benefits cause great personages forget old injuries deceived . Therefore , duke erred choice , cause ultimate ruin . [ 7 ] San Giorgio Raffaello Riario . Ascanio Ascanio Sforza . CHAPTER VIII . CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY BY WICKEDNESS Although prince may rise private station two ways , neither entirely attributed fortune genius , yet manifest I must silent , although one could copiously treated I discuss republics . These methods , either wicked nefarious ways , one ascends principality , favour fellow-citizens private person becomes prince country . And speaking first method , illustrated two examples—one ancient , modern—and without entering subject , I consider two examples suffice may compelled follow . Agathocles , Sicilian , [ 1 ] became King Syracuse private low abject position . This man , son potter , changes fortunes always led infamous life . Nevertheless , accompanied infamies much ability mind body , devoted military profession , rose ranks Praetor Syracuse . Being established position , deliberately resolved make prince seize violence , without obligation others , conceded assent , came understanding purpose Amilcar , Carthaginian , , army , fighting Sicily . One morning assembled people senate Syracuse , discuss things relating Republic , given signal soldiers killed senators richest people ; dead , seized held princedom city without civil commotion . And although twice routed Carthaginians , ultimately besieged , yet able defend city , leaving part men defence , others attacked Africa , short time raised siege Syracuse . The Carthaginians , reduced extreme necessity , compelled come terms Agathocles , , leaving Sicily , content possession Africa . [ 1 ] Agathocles Sicilian , born 361 B.C. , died 289 B.C . Therefore , considers actions genius man see nothing , little , attributed fortune , inasmuch attained pre-eminence , shown , favour one , step step military profession , steps gained thousand troubles perils , afterwards boldly held many hazardous dangers . Yet called talent slay fellow-citizens , deceive friends , without faith , without mercy , without religion ; methods may gain empire , glory . Still , courage Agathocles entering extricating dangers considered , together greatness mind enduring overcoming hardships , seen esteemed less notable captain . Nevertheless , barbarous cruelty inhumanity infinite wickedness permit celebrated among excellent men . What achieved attributed either fortune genius . In times , rule Alexander Sixth , Oliverotto da Fermo , left orphan many years , brought maternal uncle , Giovanni Fogliani , early days youth sent fight Pagolo Vitelli , , trained discipline , might attain high position military profession . After Pagolo died , fought brother Vitellozzo , short time , endowed wit vigorous body mind , became first man profession . But appearing paltry thing serve others , resolved , aid citizens Fermo , slavery country dearer liberty , help Vitelleschi , seize Fermo . So wrote Giovanni Fogliani , away home many years , wished visit city , measure look upon patrimony ; although laboured acquire anything except honour , yet , order citizens see spent time vain , desired come honourably , would accompanied one hundred horsemen , friends retainers ; entreated Giovanni arrange received honourably Fermians , would honour , also Giovanni , brought . Giovanni , therefore , fail attentions due nephew , caused honourably received Fermians , lodged house , , passed days , arranged necessary wicked designs , Oliverotto gave solemn banquet invited Giovanni Fogliani chiefs Fermo . When viands entertainments usual banquets finished , Oliverotto artfully began certain grave discourses , speaking greatness Pope Alexander son Cesare , enterprises , discourse Giovanni others answered ; rose , saying matters ought discussed private place , betook chamber , whither Giovanni rest citizens went . No sooner seated soldiers issued secret places slaughtered Giovanni rest . After murders Oliverotto , mounted horseback , rode town besieged chief magistrate palace , fear people forced obey , form government , made prince . He killed malcontents able injure , strengthened new civil military ordinances , way , year held principality , secure city Fermo , become formidable neighbours . And destruction would difficult Agathocles allowed overreached Cesare Borgia , took Orsini Vitelli Sinigalia , stated . Thus one year committed parricide , strangled , together Vitellozzo , made leader valour wickedness . Some may wonder happen Agathocles , like , infinite treacheries cruelties , live long secure country , defend external enemies , never conspired citizens ; seeing many others , means cruelty , never able even peaceful times hold state , still less doubtful times war . I believe follows severities [ 2 ] badly properly used . Those may called properly used , evil possible speak well , applied one blow necessary one ’ security , persisted afterwards unless turned advantage subjects . The badly employed , notwithstanding may commencement , multiply time rather decrease . Those practise first system able , aid God man , mitigate degree rule , Agathocles . It impossible follow maintain . [ 2 ] Mr Burd suggests word probably comes near modern equivalent Machiavelli ’ thought speaks “ crudelta ” obvious “ cruelties . ” Hence remarked , seizing state , usurper ought examine closely injuries necessary inflict , one stroke repeat daily ; thus unsettling men able reassure , win benefits . He otherwise , either timidity evil advice , always compelled keep knife hand ; neither rely subjects , attach , owing continued repeated wrongs . For injuries ought done one time , , tasted less , offend less ; benefits ought given little little , flavour may last longer . And things , prince ought live amongst people way unexpected circumstances , whether good evil , shall make change ; necessity comes troubled times , late harsh measures ; mild ones help , considered forced , one obligation . CHAPTER IX . CONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY But coming point—where leading citizen becomes prince country , wickedness intolerable violence , favour fellow citizens—this may called civil principality : genius fortune altogether necessary attain , rather happy shrewdness . I say principality obtained either favour people favour nobles . Because cities two distinct parties found , arises people wish ruled oppressed nobles , nobles wish rule oppress people ; two opposite desires arises cities one three results , either principality , self-government , anarchy . A principality created either people nobles , accordingly one opportunity ; nobles , seeing withstand people , begin cry reputation one , make prince , shadow give vent ambitions . The people , finding resist nobles , also cry reputation one , make prince defended authority . He obtains sovereignty assistance nobles maintains difficulty comes aid people , former finds many around consider equals , neither rule manage liking . But reaches sovereignty popular favour finds alone , none around , , prepared obey . Besides , one fair dealing , without injury others , satisfy nobles , satisfy people , object righteous nobles , latter wishing oppress , former desire oppressed . It added also prince never secure hostile people , many , whilst nobles secure , number . The worst prince may expect hostile people abandoned ; hostile nobles fear abandonment , also rise ; , affairs far-seeing astute , always come forward time save , obtain favours expect prevail . Further , prince compelled live always people , well without nobles , able make unmake daily , give take away authority pleases . Therefore , make point clearer , I say nobles ought looked mainly two ways : say , either shape course way binds entirely fortune , . Those bind , rapacious , ought honoured loved ; bind may dealt two ways ; may fail pusillanimity natural want courage , case ought make use , especially good counsel ; thus , whilst prosperity honour , adversity fear . But ambitious ends shun binding , token giving thought , prince ought guard , fear open enemies , adversity always help ruin . Therefore , one becomes prince favour people ought keep friendly , easily seeing ask oppressed . But one , opposition people , becomes prince favour nobles , ought , everything , seek win people , may easily takes protection . Because men , receive good expecting evil , bound closely benefactor ; thus people quickly become devoted raised principality favours ; prince win affections many ways , vary according circumstances one give fixed rules , I omit ; , I repeat , necessary prince people friendly , otherwise security adversity . Nabis , [ 1 ] Prince Spartans , sustained attack Greece , victorious Roman army , defended country government ; overcoming peril necessary make secure , would sufficient people hostile . And let one impugn statement trite proverb “ He builds people , builds mud , ” true private citizen makes foundation , persuades people free oppressed enemies magistrates ; wherein would find often deceived , happened Gracchi Rome Messer Giorgio Scali [ 2 ] Florence . But granted prince established , command , man courage , undismayed adversity , fail qualifications , , resolution energy , keeps whole people encouraged—such one never find deceived , shown laid foundations well . [ 1 ] Nabis , tyrant Sparta , conquered Romans Flamininus 195 B.C . ; killed 192 B.C . [ 2 ] Messer Giorgio Scali . This event found Machiavelli ’ “ Florentine History , ” Book III . These principalities liable danger passing civil absolute order government , princes either rule personally magistrates . In latter case government weaker insecure , rests entirely goodwill citizens raised magistracy , , especially troubled times , destroy government great ease , either intrigue open defiance ; prince chance amid tumults exercise absolute authority , citizens subjects , accustomed receive orders magistrates , mind obey amid confusions , always doubtful times scarcity men trust . For prince rely upon observes quiet times , citizens need state , every one agrees ; promise , death far distant wish die ; troubled times , state need citizens , finds . And much experiment dangerous , inasmuch tried . Therefore wise prince ought adopt course citizens always every sort kind circumstance need state , always find faithful . CHAPTER X . CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO BE MEASURED It necessary consider another point examining character principalities : , whether prince power , case need , support resources , whether always need assistance others . And make quite clear I say I consider able support resources , either abundance men money , raise sufficient army join battle one comes attack ; I consider always need others show enemy field , forced defend sheltering behind walls . The first case discussed , speak recur . In second case one say nothing except encourage princes provision fortify towns , account defend country . And whoever shall fortify town well , shall managed concerns subjects way stated , often repeated , never attacked without great caution , men always adverse enterprises difficulties seen , seen easy thing attack one town well fortified , hated people . The cities Germany absolutely free , little country around , yield obedience emperor suits , fear power may near , fortified way every one thinks taking assault would tedious difficult , seeing proper ditches walls , sufficient artillery , always keep public depots enough one year ’ eating , drinking , firing . And beyond , keep people quiet without loss state , always means giving work community labours life strength city , pursuit people supported ; also hold military exercises repute , moreover many ordinances uphold . Therefore , prince strong city , made odious , attacked , one attack driven disgrace ; , affairs world changeable , almost impossible keep army whole year field without interfered . And whoever reply : If people property outside city , see burnt , remain patient , long siege self-interest make forget prince ; I answer powerful courageous prince overcome difficulties giving one time hope subjects evil long , another time fear cruelty enemy , preserving adroitly subjects seem bold . Further , enemy would naturally arrival burn ruin country time spirits people still hot ready defence ; , therefore , much less ought prince hesitate ; time , spirits cooled , damage already done , ills incurred , longer remedy ; therefore much ready unite prince , appearing obligations houses burnt possessions ruined defence . For nature men bound benefits confer much receive . Therefore , everything well considered , difficult wise prince keep minds citizens steadfast first last , fail support defend . CHAPTER XI . CONCERNING ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES It remains speak ecclesiastical principalities , touching difficulties prior getting possession , acquired either capacity good fortune , held without either ; sustained ancient ordinances religion , all-powerful , character principalities may held matter princes behave live . These princes alone states defend ; subjects rule ; states , although unguarded , taken , subjects , although ruled , care , neither desire ability alienate . Such principalities secure happy . But upheld powers , human mind reach , I shall speak , , exalted maintained God , would act presumptuous rash man discuss . Nevertheless , one ask comes Church attained greatness temporal power , seeing Alexander backwards Italian potentates ( called potentates , every baron lord , though smallest ) valued temporal power slightly—yet king France trembles , able drive Italy , ruin Venetians—although may manifest , appear superfluous recall measure memory . Before Charles , King France , passed Italy , [ 1 ] country dominion Pope , Venetians , King Naples , Duke Milan , Florentines . These potentates two principal anxieties : one , foreigner enter Italy arms ; , none seize territory . Those anxiety Pope Venetians . To restrain Venetians union others necessary , defence Ferrara ; keep Pope made use barons Rome , , divided two factions , Orsini Colonnesi , always pretext disorder , , standing arms hands eyes Pontiff , kept pontificate weak powerless . And although might arise sometimes courageous pope , Sixtus , yet neither fortune wisdom could rid annoyances . And short life pope also cause weakness ; ten years , average life pope , difficulty lower one factions ; , speak , one people almost destroy Colonnesi , another would arise hostile Orsini , would support opponents , yet would time ruin Orsini . This reason temporal powers pope little esteemed Italy . [ 1 ] Charles VIII invaded Italy 1494 . Alexander Sixth arose afterwards , pontiffs ever showed pope money arms able prevail ; instrumentality Duke Valentino , reason entry French , brought things I discussed actions duke . And although intention aggrandize Church , duke , nevertheless , contributed greatness Church , , death ruin duke , became heir labours . Pope Julius came afterwards found Church strong , possessing Romagna , barons Rome reduced impotence , , chastisements Alexander , factions wiped ; also found way open accumulate money manner never practised Alexander ’ time . Such things Julius followed , improved upon , intended gain Bologna , ruin Venetians , drive French Italy . All enterprises prospered , much credit , inasmuch everything strengthen Church private person . He kept also Orsini Colonnesi factions within bounds found ; although among mind make disturbance , nevertheless held two things firm : one , greatness Church , terrified ; , allowing cardinals , caused disorders among . For whenever factions cardinals remain quiet long , cardinals foster factions Rome , barons compelled support , thus ambitions prelates arise disorders tumults among barons . For reasons Holiness Pope Leo [ 2 ] found pontificate powerful , hoped , others made great arms , make still greater venerated goodness infinite virtues . [ 2 ] Pope Leo X Cardinal de ’ Medici . CHAPTER XII . HOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE , AND CONCERNING MERCENARIES Having discoursed particularly characteristics principalities beginning I proposed discuss , considered degree causes good bad , shown methods many sought acquire hold , remains discuss generally means offence defence belong . We seen necessary prince foundations well laid , otherwise follows necessity go ruin . The chief foundations states , new well old composite , good laws good arms ; good laws state well armed , follows well armed good laws . I shall leave laws discussion shall speak arms . I say , therefore , arms prince defends state either , mercenaries , auxiliaries , mixed . Mercenaries auxiliaries useless dangerous ; one holds state based arms , stand neither firm safe ; disunited , ambitious , without discipline , unfaithful , valiant friends , cowardly enemies ; neither fear God fidelity men , destruction deferred long attack ; peace one robbed , war enemy . The fact , attraction reason keeping field trifle stipend , sufficient make willing die . They ready enough soldiers whilst make war , war comes take run foe ; I little trouble prove , ruin Italy caused nothing else resting hopes many years mercenaries , although formerly made display appeared valiant amongst , yet foreigners came showed . Thus Charles , King France , allowed seize Italy chalk hand ; [ 1 ] told us sins cause told truth , sins imagined , I related . And sins princes , princes also suffered penalty . [ 1 ] “ With chalk hand , ” “ col gesso. ” This one _bons mots_ Alexander VI , refers ease Charles VIII seized Italy , implying necessary send quartermasters chalk billets soldiers conquer country . _Cf_ . “ The History Henry VII , ” Lord Bacon : “ King Charles conquered realm Naples , lost , kind felicity dream . He passed whole length Italy without resistance : true Pope Alexander wont say : That Frenchmen came Italy chalk hands , mark lodgings , rather swords fight . ” I wish demonstrate infelicity arms . The mercenary captains either capable men ; , trust , always aspire greatness , either oppressing , master , others contrary intentions ; captain skilful , ruined usual way . And urged whoever armed act way , whether mercenary , I reply arms resorted , either prince republic , prince ought go person perform duty captain ; republic send citizens , one sent turn satisfactorily , ought recall , one worthy , hold laws leave command . And experience shown princes republics , single-handed , making greatest progress , mercenaries nothing except damage ; difficult bring republic , armed arms , sway one citizens bring one armed foreign arms . Rome Sparta stood many ages armed free . The Switzers completely armed quite free . Of ancient mercenaries , example , Carthaginians , oppressed mercenary soldiers first war Romans , although Carthaginians citizens captains . After death Epaminondas , Philip Macedon made captain soldiers Thebans , victory took away liberty . Duke Filippo dead , Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza Venetians , , overcome enemy Caravaggio , [ 2 ] allied crush Milanese , masters . His father , Sforza , engaged Queen Johanna [ 3 ] Naples , left unprotected , forced throw arms King Aragon , order save kingdom . And Venetians Florentines formerly extended dominions arms , yet captains make princes , defended , I reply Florentines case favoured chance , able captains , might stood fear , conquered , opposed , others turned ambitions elsewhere . One conquer Giovanni Acuto , [ 4 ] since conquer fidelity proved ; every one acknowledge , conquered , Florentines would stood discretion . Sforza Bracceschi always , watched . Francesco turned ambition Lombardy ; Braccio Church kingdom Naples . But let us come happened short ago . The Florentines appointed captain Pagolo Vitelli , prudent man , private position risen greatest renown . If man taken Pisa , nobody deny would proper Florentines keep , became soldier enemies means resisting , held must obey . The Venetians , achievements considered , seen acted safely gloriously long sent war men , armed gentlemen plebians valiantly . This turned enterprises land , began fight land forsook virtue followed custom Italy . And beginning expansion land , much territory , great reputation , much fear captains ; expanded , Carmignuola , [ 5 ] taste mistake ; , found valiant man ( beat Duke Milan leadership ) , , hand , knowing lukewarm war , feared would longer conquer , reason willing , able , let go ; , lose acquired , compelled , order secure , murder . They afterwards captains Bartolomeo da Bergamo , Roberto da San Severino , count Pitigliano , [ 6 ] like , dread loss gain , happened afterwards Vaila , [ 7 ] one battle lost eight hundred years acquired much trouble . Because arms conquests come slowly , long delayed inconsiderable , losses sudden portentous . [ 2 ] Battle Caravaggio , 15th September 1448 . [ 3 ] Johanna II Naples , widow Ladislao , King Naples . [ 4 ] Giovanni Acuto . An English knight whose name Sir John Hawkwood . He fought English wars France , knighted Edward III ; afterwards collected body troops went Italy . These became famous “ White Company. ” He took part many wars , died Florence 1394 . He born 1320 Sible Hedingham , village Essex . He married Domnia , daughter Bernabo Visconti . [ 5 ] Carmignuola . Francesco Bussone , born Carmagnola 1390 , executed Venice , 5th May 1432 . [ 6 ] Bartolomeo Colleoni Bergamo ; died 1457 . Roberto San Severino ; died fighting Venice Sigismund , Duke Austria , 1487 . “ Primo capitano Italia. ” —Machiavelli . Count Pitigliano ; Nicolo Orsini , born 1442 , died 1510 . [ 7 ] Battle Vaila 1509 . And examples I reached Italy , ruled many years mercenaries , I wish discuss seriously , order , seen rise progress , one may better prepared counteract . You must understand empire recently come repudiated Italy , Pope acquired temporal power , Italy divided states , reason many great cities took arms nobles , , formerly favoured emperor , oppressing , whilst Church favouring gain authority temporal power : many others citizens became princes . From came pass Italy fell partly hands Church republics , , Church consisting priests republic citizens unaccustomed arms , commenced enlist foreigners . The first gave renown soldiery Alberigo da Conio , [ 8 ] Romagnian . From school man sprang , among others , Braccio Sforza , time arbiters Italy . After came captains till directed arms Italy ; end valour , overrun Charles , robbed Louis , ravaged Ferdinand , insulted Switzers . The principle guided , first , lower credit infantry might increase . They , subsisting pay without territory , unable support many soldiers , infantry give authority ; led employ cavalry , moderate force maintained honoured ; affairs brought pass , army twenty thousand soldiers , found two thousand foot soldiers . They , besides , used every art lessen fatigue danger soldiers , killing fray , taking prisoners liberating without ransom . They attack towns night , garrisons towns attack encampments night ; surround camp either stockade ditch , campaign winter . All things permitted military rules , devised avoid , I said , fatigue dangers ; thus brought Italy slavery contempt . [ 8 ] Alberigo da Conio . Alberico da Barbiano , Count Cunio Romagna . He leader famous “ Company St George , ” composed entirely Italian soldiers . He died 1409 . CHAPTER XIII . CONCERNING AUXILIARIES , MIXED SOLDIERY , AND ONE ’ S OWN Auxiliaries , useless arm , employed prince called forces aid defend , done Pope Julius recent times ; , , enterprise Ferrara , poor proof mercenaries , turned auxiliaries , stipulated Ferdinand , King Spain , [ 1 ] assistance men arms . These arms may useful good , calls always disadvantageous ; losing , one undone , winning , one captive . [ 1 ] Ferdinand V ( F. II Aragon Sicily , F. III Naples ) , surnamed “ The Catholic , ” born 1452 , died 1516 . And although ancient histories may full examples , I wish leave recent one Pope Julius Second , peril fail perceived ; , wishing get Ferrara , threw entirely hands foreigner . But good fortune brought third event , reap fruit rash choice ; , auxiliaries routed Ravenna , Switzers risen driven conquerors ( expectation , others ) , came pass become prisoner enemies , fled , auxiliaries , conquered arms . The Florentines , entirely without arms , sent ten thousand Frenchmen take Pisa , whereby ran danger time troubles . The Emperor Constantinople , [ 2 ] oppose neighbours , sent ten thousand Turks Greece , , war finished , willing quit ; beginning servitude Greece infidels . [ 2 ] Joannes Cantacuzenus , born 1300 , died 1383 . Therefore , let desire conquer make use arms , much hazardous mercenaries , ruin ready made ; united , yield obedience others ; mercenaries , conquered , time better opportunities needed injure ; one community , found paid , third party , made head , able assume enough authority injure . In conclusion , mercenaries dastardy dangerous ; auxiliaries , valour . The wise prince , therefore , always avoided arms turned ; willing rather lose conquer others , deeming real victory gained arms others . I shall never hesitate cite Cesare Borgia actions . This duke entered Romagna auxiliaries , taking French soldiers , captured Imola Forli ; afterwards , forces appearing reliable , turned mercenaries , discerning less danger , enlisted Orsini Vitelli ; presently , handling finding doubtful , unfaithful , dangerous , destroyed turned men . And difference one forces easily seen one considers difference reputation duke , French , Orsini Vitelli , relied soldiers , whose fidelity could always count found ever increasing ; never esteemed highly every one saw complete master forces . I intending go beyond Italian recent examples , I unwilling leave Hiero , Syracusan , one I named . This man , I said , made head army Syracusans , soon found mercenary soldiery , constituted like Italian condottieri , use ; appearing could neither keep let go , cut pieces , afterwards made war forces aliens . I wish also recall memory instance Old Testament applicable subject . David offered Saul fight Goliath , Philistine champion , , give courage , Saul armed weapons ; David rejected soon back , saying could make use , wished meet enemy sling knife . In conclusion , arms others either fall back , weigh , bind fast . Charles Seventh , [ 3 ] father King Louis Eleventh , [ 4 ] good fortune valour liberated France English , recognized necessity armed forces , established kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms infantry . Afterwards son , King Louis , abolished infantry began enlist Switzers , mistake , followed others , , seen , source peril kingdom ; , raised reputation Switzers , entirely diminished value arms , destroyed infantry altogether ; men-at-arms subordinated others , , accustomed fight along Switzers , appear conquer without . Hence arises French stand Switzers , without Switzers come well others . The armies French thus become mixed , partly mercenary partly national , arms together much better mercenaries alone auxiliaries alone , much inferior one ’ forces . And example proves , kingdom France would unconquerable ordinance Charles enlarged maintained . [ 3 ] Charles VII France , surnamed “ The Victorious , ” born 1403 , died 1461 . [ 4 ] Louis XI , son , born 1423 , died 1483 . But scanty wisdom man , entering affair looks well first , discern poison hidden , I said hectic fevers . Therefore , rules principality recognize evils upon , truly wise ; insight given . And first disaster Roman Empire [ 5 ] examined , found commenced enlisting Goths ; time vigour Roman Empire began decline , valour raised passed away others . [ 5 ] “ Many speakers House night debate reduction armaments seemed show lamentable ignorance conditions British Empire maintains existence . When Mr Balfour replied allegations Roman Empire sank weight military obligations , said ‘ wholly unhistorical. ’ He might well added Roman power zenith every citizen acknowledged liability fight State , began decline soon obligation longer recognised. ” —_Pall Mall Gazette_ , 15th May 1906 . I conclude , therefore , principality secure without forces ; contrary , entirely dependent good fortune , valour adversity would defend . And always opinion judgment wise men nothing uncertain unstable fame power founded strength . And one ’ forces composed either subjects , citizens , dependents ; others mercenaries auxiliaries . And way make ready one ’ forces easily found rules suggested shall reflected upon , one consider Philip , father Alexander Great , many republics princes armed organized , rules I entirely commit . CHAPTER XIV . THAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR A prince ought aim thought , select anything else study , war rules discipline ; sole art belongs rules , force upholds born princes , often enables men rise private station rank . And , contrary , seen princes thought ease arms lost states . And first cause losing neglect art ; enables acquire state master art . Francesco Sforza , martial , private person became Duke Milan ; sons , avoiding hardships troubles arms , dukes became private persons . For among evils unarmed brings , causes despised , one ignominies prince ought guard , shown later . Because nothing proportionate armed unarmed ; reasonable armed yield obedience willingly unarmed , unarmed man secure among armed servants . Because , one disdain suspicion , possible work well together . And therefore prince understand art war , misfortunes already mentioned , respected soldiers , rely . He ought never , therefore , thoughts subject war , peace addict exercise war ; two ways , one action , study . As regards action , ought things keep men well organized drilled , follow incessantly chase , accustoms body hardships , learns something nature localities , gets find mountains rise , valleys open , plains lie , understand nature rivers marshes , take greatest care . Which knowledge useful two ways . Firstly , learns know country , better able undertake defence ; afterwards , means knowledge observation locality , understands ease may necessary study hereafter ; hills , valleys , plains , rivers marshes , instance , Tuscany , certain resemblance countries , knowledge aspect one country one easily arrive knowledge others . And prince lacks skill lacks essential desirable captain possess , teaches surprise enemy , select quarters , lead armies , array battle , besiege towns advantage . Philopoemen , [ 1 ] Prince Achaeans , among praises writers bestowed , commended time peace never anything mind rules war ; country friends , often stopped reasoned : “ If enemy upon hill , find army , would advantage ? How one best advance meet , keeping ranks ? If wish retreat , ought pursue ? ” And would set forth , went , chances could befall army ; would listen opinion state , confirming reasons , continual discussions could never arise , time war , unexpected circumstances could deal . [ 1 ] Philopoemen , “ last Greeks , ” born 252 B.C. , died 183 B.C . But exercise intellect prince read histories , study actions illustrious men , see borne war , examine causes victories defeat , avoid latter imitate former ; illustrious man , took exemplar one praised famous , whose achievements deeds always kept mind , said Alexander Great imitated Achilles , Caesar Alexander , Scipio Cyrus . And whoever reads life Cyrus , written Xenophon , recognize afterwards life Scipio imitation glory , chastity , affability , humanity , liberality Scipio conformed things written Cyrus Xenophon . A wise prince ought observe rules , never peaceful times stand idle , increase resources industry way may available adversity , fortune chances may find prepared resist blows . CHAPTER XV . CONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN , AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES , ARE PRAISED OR BLAMED It remains see ought rules conduct prince towards subject friends . And I know many written point , I expect I shall considered presumptuous mentioning , especially discussing I shall depart methods people . But , intention write thing shall useful apprehends , appears appropriate follow real truth matter imagination ; many pictured republics principalities fact never known seen , one lives far distant one ought live , neglects done ought done , sooner effects ruin preservation ; man wishes act entirely professions virtue soon meets destroys among much evil . Hence necessary prince wishing hold know wrong , make use according necessity . Therefore , putting one side imaginary things concerning prince , discussing real , I say men spoken , chiefly princes highly placed , remarkable qualities bring either blame praise ; thus one reputed liberal , another miserly , using Tuscan term ( avaricious person language still desires possess robbery , whilst call one miserly deprives much use ) ; one reputed generous , one rapacious ; one cruel , one compassionate ; one faithless , another faithful ; one effeminate cowardly , another bold brave ; one affable , another haughty ; one lascivious , another chaste ; one sincere , another cunning ; one hard , another easy ; one grave , another frivolous ; one religious , another unbelieving , like . And I know every one confess would praiseworthy prince exhibit qualities considered good ; neither entirely possessed observed , human conditions permit , necessary sufficiently prudent may know avoid reproach vices would lose state ; also keep , possible , would lose ; possible , may less hesitation abandon . And , need make uneasy incurring reproach vices without state saved difficulty , everything considered carefully , found something looks like virtue , followed , would ruin ; whilst something else , looks like vice , yet followed brings security prosperity . CHAPTER XVI . CONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS Commencing first above-named characteristics , I say would well reputed liberal . Nevertheless , liberality exercised way bring reputation , injures ; one exercises honestly exercised , may become known , avoid reproach opposite . Therefore , one wishing maintain among men name liberal obliged avoid attribute magnificence ; prince thus inclined consume acts property , compelled end , wish maintain name liberal , unduly weigh people , tax , everything get money . This soon make odious subjects , becoming poor little valued one ; thus , liberality , offended many rewarded , affected first trouble imperilled whatever may first danger ; recognizing , wishing draw back , runs reproach miserly . Therefore , prince , able exercise virtue liberality way recognized , except cost , wise ought fear reputation mean , time come considered liberal , seeing economy revenues enough , defend attacks , able engage enterprises without burdening people ; thus comes pass exercises liberality towards take , numberless , meanness towards give , . We seen great things done time except considered mean ; rest failed . Pope Julius Second assisted reaching papacy reputation liberality , yet strive afterwards keep , made war King France ; made many wars without imposing extraordinary tax subjects , supplied additional expenses long thriftiness . The present King Spain would undertaken conquered many enterprises reputed liberal . A prince , therefore , provided rob subjects , defend , become poor abject , forced become rapacious , ought hold little account reputation mean , one vices enable govern . And one say : Caesar obtained empire liberality , many others reached highest positions liberal , considered , I answer : Either prince fact , way become one . In first case liberality dangerous , second necessary considered liberal ; Caesar one wished become pre-eminent Rome ; survived becoming , moderated expenses , would destroyed government . And one reply : Many princes , done great things armies , considered liberal , I reply : Either prince spends subjects ’ else others . In first case ought sparing , second ought neglect opportunity liberality . And prince goes forth army , supporting pillage , sack , extortion , handling belongs others , liberality necessary , otherwise would followed soldiers . And neither subjects ’ ready giver , Cyrus , Caesar , Alexander ; take away reputation squander others , adds ; squandering injures . And nothing wastes rapidly liberality , even whilst exercise lose power , become either poor despised , else , avoiding poverty , rapacious hated . And prince guard , things , despised hated ; liberality leads . Therefore wiser reputation meanness brings reproach without hatred , compelled seeking reputation liberality incur name rapacity begets reproach hatred . CHAPTER XVII . CONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY , AND WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO BE LOVED THAN FEARED Coming qualities mentioned , I say every prince ought desire considered clement cruel . Nevertheless ought take care misuse clemency . Cesare Borgia considered cruel ; notwithstanding , cruelty reconciled Romagna , unified , restored peace loyalty . And rightly considered , seen much merciful Florentine people , , avoid reputation cruelty , permitted Pistoia destroyed . [ 1 ] Therefore prince , long keeps subjects united loyal , ought mind reproach cruelty ; examples merciful , much mercy , allow disorders arise , follow murders robberies ; wont injure whole people , whilst executions originate prince offend individual . [ 1 ] During rioting Cancellieri Panciatichi factions 1502 1503 . And princes , impossible new prince avoid imputation cruelty , owing new states full dangers . Hence Virgil , mouth Dido , excuses inhumanity reign owing new , saying : “ Res dura , et regni novitas talia cogunt Moliri , et late fines custode tueri. ” [ 2 ] Nevertheless ought slow believe act , show fear , proceed temperate manner prudence humanity , much confidence may make incautious much distrust render intolerable . [ 2 ] . . . , fate A throne unsettled , infant state , Bid defend realms pow ’ rs , And guard severities shores . Christopher Pitt . Upon question arises : whether better loved feared feared loved ? It may answered one wish , , difficult unite one person , much safer feared loved , , two , either must dispensed . Because asserted general men , ungrateful , fickle , false , cowardly , covetous , long succeed entirely ; offer blood , property , life , children , said , need far distant ; approaches turn . And prince , relying entirely promises , neglected precautions , ruined ; friendships obtained payments , greatness nobility mind , may indeed earned , secured , time need relied upon ; men less scruple offending one beloved one feared , love preserved link obligation , owing baseness men , broken every opportunity advantage ; fear preserves dread punishment never fails . Nevertheless prince ought inspire fear way , win love , avoids hatred ; endure well feared whilst hated , always long abstains property citizens subjects women . But necessary proceed life someone , must proper justification manifest cause , things must keep hands property others , men quickly forget death father loss patrimony . Besides , pretexts taking away property never wanting ; begun live robbery always find pretexts seizing belongs others ; reasons taking life , contrary , difficult find sooner lapse . But prince army , control multitude soldiers , quite necessary disregard reputation cruelty , without would never hold army united disposed duties . Among wonderful deeds Hannibal one enumerated : led enormous army , composed many various races men , fight foreign lands , dissensions arose either among prince , whether bad good fortune . This arose nothing else inhuman cruelty , , boundless valour , made revered terrible sight soldiers , without cruelty , virtues sufficient produce effect . And short-sighted writers admire deeds one point view another condemn principal cause . That true virtues would sufficient may proved case Scipio , excellent man , times within memory man , , nevertheless , army rebelled Spain ; arose nothing great forbearance , gave soldiers license consistent military discipline . For upbraided Senate Fabius Maximus , called corrupter Roman soldiery . The Locrians laid waste legate Scipio , yet avenged , insolence legate punished , owing entirely easy nature . Insomuch someone Senate , wishing excuse , said many men knew much better err correct errors others . This disposition , continued command , would destroyed time fame glory Scipio ; , control Senate , injurious characteristic concealed , contributed glory . Returning question feared loved , I come conclusion , men loving according fearing according prince , wise prince establish control others ; must endeavour avoid hatred , noted . CHAPTER XVIII . [ 1 ] CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH [ 1 ] “ The present chapter given greater offence portion Machiavelli ’ writings. ” Burd , “ Il Principe , ” p. 297 . Every one admits praiseworthy prince keep faith , live integrity craft . Nevertheless experience princes done great things held good faith little account , known circumvent intellect men craft , end overcome relied word . You must know two ways contesting , [ 2 ] one law , force ; first method proper men , second beasts ; first frequently sufficient , necessary recourse second . Therefore necessary prince understand avail beast man . This figuratively taught princes ancient writers , describe Achilles many princes old given Centaur Chiron nurse , brought discipline ; means solely , teacher one half beast half man , necessary prince know make use natures , one without durable . A prince , therefore , compelled knowingly adopt beast , ought choose fox lion ; lion defend snares fox defend wolves . Therefore , necessary fox discover snares lion terrify wolves . Those rely simply lion understand . Therefore wise lord , ought , keep faith observance may turned , reasons caused pledge exist longer . If men entirely good precept would hold , bad , keep faith , bound observe . Nor ever wanting prince legitimate reasons excuse non-observance . Of endless modern examples could given , showing many treaties engagements made void effect faithlessness princes ; known best employ fox succeeded best . [ 2 ] “ Contesting , ” _i.e_ . “ striving mastery. ” Mr Burd points passage imitated directly Cicero ’ “ De Officiis ” : “ Nam cum sint duo genera decertandi , unum per disceptationem , alterum per vim ; cumque illud proprium sit hominis , hoc beluarum ; confugiendum est ad posterius , si uti non licet superiore . ” But necessary know well disguise characteristic , great pretender dissembler ; men simple , subject present necessities , seeks deceive always find someone allow deceived . One recent example I pass silence . Alexander Sixth nothing else deceive men , ever thought otherwise , always found victims ; never man greater power asserting , greater oaths would affirm thing , yet would observe less ; nevertheless deceits always succeeded according wishes , [ 3 ] well understood side mankind . [ 3 ] “ Nondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni ( ad votum ) . ” The words “ ad votum ” omitted Testina addition , 1550 . Alexander never said , Cesare never said . Italian Proverb . Therefore unnecessary prince good qualities I enumerated , necessary appear . And I shall dare say also , always observe injurious , appear useful ; appear merciful , faithful , humane , religious , upright , , mind framed require , may able know change opposite . And understand , prince , especially new one , observe things men esteemed , often forced , order maintain state , act contrary fidelity , [ 4 ] friendship , humanity , religion . Therefore necessary mind ready turn accordingly winds variations fortune force , yet , I said , diverge good avoid , , compelled , know set . [ 4 ] “ Contrary fidelity ” “ faith , ” “ contro alla fede , ” “ tutto fede , ” “ altogether faithful , ” next paragraph . It noteworthy two phrases , “ contro alla fede ” “ tutto fede , ” omitted Testina edition , published sanction papal authorities . It may meaning attached word “ fede ” “ faith , ” _i.e_ . Catholic creed , rendered “ fidelity ” “ faithful. ” Observe word “ religione ” suffered stand text Testina , used signify indifferently every shade belief , witness “ religion , ” phrase inevitably employed designate Huguenot heresy . South Sermon IX , p. 69 , ed . 1843 , comments passage follows : “ That great patron Coryphaeus tribe , Nicolo Machiavel , laid master rule political scheme : ‘ That show religion helpful politician , reality hurtful pernicious . ’ ” For reason prince ought take care never lets anything slip lips replete above-named five qualities , may appear sees hears altogether merciful , faithful , humane , upright , religious . There nothing necessary appear last quality , inasmuch men judge generally eye hand , belongs everybody see , come touch . Every one sees appear , really know , dare oppose opinion many , majesty state defend ; actions men , especially princes , prudent challenge , one judges result . For reason , let prince credit conquering holding state , means always considered honest , praised everybody ; vulgar always taken thing seems comes ; world vulgar , find place many ground rest . One prince [ 5 ] present time , well name , never preaches anything else peace good faith , hostile , either , kept , would deprived reputation kingdom many time . [ 5 ] Ferdinand Aragon . “ When Machiavelli writing _The Prince_ would clearly impossible mention Ferdinand ’ name without giving offence. ” Burd ’ “ Il Principe , ” p. 308 . CHAPTER XIX . THAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED Now , concerning characteristics mention made , I spoken important ones , others I wish discuss briefly generality , prince must consider , part said , avoid things make hated contemptible ; often shall succeeded fulfilled part , need fear danger reproaches . It makes hated things , I said , rapacious , violator property women subjects , must abstain . And neither property honor touched , majority men live content , contend ambition , curb ease many ways . It makes contemptible considered fickle , frivolous , effeminate , mean-spirited , irresolute , prince guard rock ; endeavour show actions greatness , courage , gravity , fortitude ; private dealings subjects let show judgments irrevocable , maintain reputation one hope either deceive get round . That prince highly esteemed conveys impression , highly esteemed easily conspired ; , provided well known excellent man revered people , attacked difficulty . For reason prince ought two fears , one within , account subjects , without , account external powers . From latter defended well armed good allies , well armed good friends , affairs always remain quiet within quiet without , unless already disturbed conspiracy ; even affairs outside disturbed , carried preparations lived I said , long despair , resist every attack , I said Nabis Spartan . But concerning subjects , affairs outside disturbed fear conspire secretly , prince easily secure avoiding hated despised , keeping people satisfied , necessary accomplish , I said length . And one efficacious remedies prince conspiracies hated despised people , conspires prince always expects please removal ; conspirator look forward offending , courage take course , difficulties confront conspirator infinite . And experience shows , many conspiracies , successful ; conspires act alone , take companion except believes malcontents , soon opened mind malcontent given material content , denouncing look every advantage ; , seeing gain course assured , seeing doubtful full dangers , must rare friend , thoroughly obstinate enemy prince , keep faith . And , reduce matter small compass , I say , side conspirator , nothing fear , jealousy , prospect punishment terrify ; side prince majesty principality , laws , protection friends state defend ; , adding things popular goodwill , impossible one rash conspire . For whereas general conspirator fear execution plot , case also fear sequel crime ; account people enemy , thus hope escape . Endless examples could given subject , I content one , brought pass within memory fathers . Messer Annibale Bentivogli , prince Bologna ( grandfather present Annibale ) , murdered Canneschi , conspired , one family survived Messer Giovanni , [ 1 ] childhood : immediately assassination people rose murdered Canneschi . This sprung popular goodwill house Bentivogli enjoyed days Bologna ; great , although none remained death Annibale able rule state , Bolognese , information one Bentivogli family Florence , time considered son blacksmith , sent Florence gave government city , ruled Messer Giovanni came due course government . [ 1 ] Giovanni Bentivogli , born Bologna 1438 , died Milan 1508 . He ruled Bologna 1462 1506 . Machiavelli ’ strong condemnation conspiracies may get edge recent experience ( February 1513 ) , arrested tortured alleged complicity Boscoli conspiracy . For reason I consider prince ought reckon conspiracies little account people hold esteem ; hostile , bears hatred towards , ought fear everything everybody . And well-ordered states wise princes taken every care drive nobles desperation , keep people satisfied contented , one important objects prince . Among best ordered governed kingdoms times France , found many good institutions depend liberty security king ; first parliament authority , founded kingdom , knowing ambition nobility boldness , considered bit mouths would necessary hold ; , side , knowing hatred people , founded fear , nobles , wished protect , yet anxious particular care king ; therefore , take away reproach would liable nobles favouring people , people favouring nobles , set arbiter , one could beat great favour lesser without reproach king . Neither could better prudent arrangement , greater source security king kingdom . From one draw another important conclusion , princes ought leave affairs reproach management others , keep grace hands . And , I consider prince ought cherish nobles , make hated people . It may appear , perhaps , examined lives deaths Roman emperors many would example contrary opinion , seeing lived nobly showed great qualities soul , nevertheless lost empire killed subjects conspired . Wishing , therefore , answer objections , I recall characters emperors , show causes ruin different alleged ; time I submit consideration things noteworthy studies affairs times . It seems sufficient take emperors succeeded empire Marcus philosopher Maximinus ; Marcus son Commodus , Pertinax , Julian , Severus son Antoninus Caracalla , Macrinus , Heliogabalus , Alexander , Maximinus . There first note , whereas principalities ambition nobles insolence people contended , Roman emperors third difficulty put cruelty avarice soldiers , matter beset difficulties ruin many ; hard thing give satisfaction soldiers people ; people loved peace , reason loved unaspiring prince , whilst soldiers loved warlike prince bold , cruel , rapacious , qualities quite willing exercise upon people , could get double pay give vent greed cruelty . Hence arose emperors always overthrown , either birth training , great authority , , especially came new principality , recognizing difficulty two opposing humours , inclined give satisfaction soldiers , caring little injuring people . Which course necessary , , princes help hated someone , ought , first place , avoid hated every one , compass , ought endeavour utmost diligence avoid hatred powerful . Therefore , emperors inexperience need special favour adhered readily soldiers people ; course turned advantageous , accordingly prince knew maintain authority . From causes arose Marcus , Pertinax , Alexander , men modest life , lovers justice , enemies cruelty , humane , benignant , came sad end except Marcus ; alone lived died honoured , succeeded throne hereditary title , owed nothing either soldiers people ; afterwards , possessed many virtues made respected , always kept orders places whilst lived , neither hated despised . But Pertinax created emperor wishes soldiers , , accustomed live licentiously Commodus , could endure honest life Pertinax wished reduce ; thus , given cause hatred , hatred added contempt old age , overthrown beginning administration . And noted hatred acquired much good works bad ones , therefore , I said , prince wishing keep state often forced evil ; body corrupt think need maintain yourself—it may either people soldiers nobles—you submit humours gratify , good works harm . But let us come Alexander , man great goodness , among praises accorded , fourteen years held empire one ever put death unjudged ; nevertheless , considered effeminate man allowed governed mother , became despised , army conspired , murdered . Turning opposite characters Commodus , Severus , Antoninus Caracalla , Maximinus , find cruel rapacious-men , satisfy soldiers , hesitate commit every kind iniquity people ; , except Severus , came bad end ; Severus much valour , keeping soldiers friendly , although people oppressed , reigned successfully ; valour made much admired sight soldiers people latter kept way astonished awed former respectful satisfied . And actions man , new prince , great , I wish show briefly knew well counterfeit fox lion , natures , I said , necessary prince imitate . Knowing sloth Emperor Julian , persuaded army Sclavonia , captain , would right go Rome avenge death Pertinax , killed praetorian soldiers ; pretext , without appearing aspire throne , moved army Rome , reached Italy known started . On arrival Rome , Senate , fear , elected emperor killed Julian . After remained Severus , wished make master whole empire , two difficulties ; one Asia , Niger , head Asiatic army , caused proclaimed emperor ; west Albinus , also aspired throne . And considered dangerous declare hostile , decided attack Niger deceive Albinus . To latter wrote , elected emperor Senate , willing share dignity sent title Caesar ; , moreover , Senate made Albinus colleague ; things accepted Albinus true . But Severus conquered killed Niger , settled oriental affairs , returned Rome complained Senate Albinus , little recognizing benefits received , treachery sought murder , ingratitude compelled punish . Afterwards sought France , took government life . He , therefore , carefully examine actions man find valiant lion cunning fox ; find feared respected every one , hated army ; need wondered , new man , able hold empire well , supreme renown always protected hatred people might conceived violence . But son Antoninus eminent man , excellent qualities , made admirable sight people acceptable soldiers , warlike man , enduring fatigue , despiser delicate food luxuries , caused beloved armies . Nevertheless , ferocity cruelties great unheard , endless single murders , killed large number people Rome Alexandria . He became hated whole world , also feared around , extent murdered midst army centurion . And must noted such-like deaths , deliberately inflicted resolved desperate courage , avoided princes , one fear die inflict ; prince may fear less rare ; careful grave injury employs around service state . Antoninus taken care , contumeliously killed brother centurion , also daily threatened , yet retained bodyguard ; , turned , rash thing , proved emperor ’ ruin . But let us come Commodus , easy hold empire , , son Marcus , inherited , follow footsteps father please people soldiers ; , nature cruel brutal , gave amusing soldiers corrupting , might indulge rapacity upon people ; hand , maintaining dignity , often descending theatre compete gladiators , vile things , little worthy imperial majesty , fell contempt soldiers , hated one party despised , conspired killed . It remains discuss character Maximinus . He warlike man , armies , disgusted effeminacy Alexander , I already spoken , killed elected Maximinus throne . This possess long , two things made hated despised ; one , kept sheep Thrace , brought contempt ( well known , considered great indignity every one ) , , accession dominions deferred going Rome taking possession imperial seat ; also gained reputation utmost ferocity , prefects Rome elsewhere empire , practised many cruelties , whole world moved anger meanness birth fear barbarity . First Africa rebelled , Senate people Rome , Italy conspired , may added army ; latter , besieging Aquileia meeting difficulties taking , disgusted cruelties , fearing less found many , murdered . I wish discuss Heliogabalus , Macrinus , Julian , , thoroughly contemptible , quickly wiped ; I bring discourse conclusion saying princes times difficulty giving inordinate satisfaction soldiers far less degree , , notwithstanding one give indulgence , soon done ; none princes armies veterans governance administration provinces , armies Roman Empire ; whereas necessary give satisfaction soldiers people , necessary princes , except Turk Soldan , satisfy people rather soldiers , people powerful . From I excepted Turk , always keeps round twelve thousand infantry fifteen thousand cavalry depend security strength kingdom , necessary , putting aside every consideration people , keep friends . The kingdom Soldan similar ; entirely hands soldiers , follows , without regard people , must keep friends . But must note state Soldan unlike principalities , reason like Christian pontificate , called either hereditary newly formed principality ; sons old prince heirs , elected position authority , sons remain noblemen . And ancient custom , called new principality , none difficulties met new ones ; although prince new , constitution state old , framed receive hereditary lord . But returning subject discourse , I say whoever consider acknowledge either hatred contempt fatal above-named emperors , recognized also happened , number acting one way number another , one way came happy end rest unhappy ones . Because would useless dangerous Pertinax Alexander , new princes , imitate Marcus , heir principality ; likewise would utterly destructive Caracalla , Commodus , Maximinus imitated Severus , sufficient valour enable tread footsteps . Therefore prince , new principality , imitate actions Marcus , , , necessary follow Severus , ought take Severus parts necessary found state , Marcus proper glorious keep state may already stable firm . CHAPTER XX . ARE FORTRESSES , AND MANY OTHER THINGS TO WHICH PRINCES OFTEN RESORT , ADVANTAGEOUS OR HURTFUL ? 1 . Some princes , hold securely state , disarmed subjects ; others kept subject towns distracted factions ; others fostered enmities ; others laid gain distrusted beginning governments ; built fortresses ; overthrown destroyed . And although one give final judgment things unless one possesses particulars states decision made , nevertheless I speak comprehensively matter admit . 2 . There never new prince disarmed subjects ; rather found disarmed always armed , , arming , arms become , men distrusted become faithful , faithful kept , subjects become adherents . And whereas subjects armed , yet arm benefited , others handled freely , difference treatment , quite understand , makes former dependents , latter , considering necessary danger service reward , excuse . But disarm , offend showing distrust , either cowardice want loyalty , either opinions breeds hatred . And remain unarmed , follows turn mercenaries , character already shown ; even good would sufficient defend powerful enemies distrusted subjects . Therefore , I said , new prince new principality always distributed arms . Histories full examples . But prince acquires new state , adds province old one , necessary disarm men state , except adherents acquiring ; , time opportunity , rendered soft effeminate ; matters managed way armed men state shall soldiers old state living near . 3 . Our forefathers , reckoned wise , accustomed say necessary hold Pistoia factions Pisa fortresses ; idea fostered quarrels tributary towns keep possession easily . This may well enough times Italy way balanced , I believe accepted precept to-day , I believe factions ever use ; rather certain enemy comes upon divided cities quickly lost , weakest party always assist outside forces able resist . The Venetians , moved , I believe , reasons , fostered Guelph Ghibelline factions tributary cities ; although never allowed come bloodshed , yet nursed disputes amongst , citizens , distracted differences , unite . Which , saw , afterwards turn expected , , rout Vaila , one party took courage seized state . Such methods argue , therefore , weakness prince , factions never permitted vigorous principality ; methods enabling one easily manage subjects useful times peace , war comes policy proves fallacious . 4 . Without doubt princes become great overcome difficulties obstacles confronted , therefore fortune , especially desires make new prince great , greater necessity earn renown hereditary one , causes enemies arise form designs , order may opportunity overcoming , mount higher , ladder enemies raised . For reason many consider wise prince , opportunity , ought craft foster animosity , , crushed , renown may rise higher . 5 . Princes , especially new ones , found fidelity assistance men beginning rule distrusted among beginning trusted . Pandolfo Petrucci , Prince Siena , ruled state distrusted others . But question one speak generally , varies much individual ; I say , men commencement princedom hostile , description need assistance support , always gained greatest ease , tightly held serve prince fidelity , inasmuch know necessary cancel deeds bad impression formed ; thus prince always extracts profit , serving much security , may neglect affairs . And since matter demands , I must fail warn prince , means secret favours acquired new state , must well consider reasons induced favour ; natural affection towards , discontent government , keep friendly great trouble difficulty , impossible satisfy . And weighing well reasons examples taken ancient modern affairs , shall find easier prince make friends men contented former government , therefore enemies , , discontented , favourable encouraged seize . 6 . It custom princes , order hold states securely , build fortresses may serve bridle bit might design work , place refuge first attack . I praise system made use formerly . Notwithstanding , Messer Nicolo Vitelli times seen demolish two fortresses Citta di Castello might keep state ; Guido Ubaldo , Duke Urbino , returning dominion , whence driven Cesare Borgia , razed foundations fortresses province , considered without would difficult lose ; Bentivogli returning Bologna came similar decision . Fortresses , therefore , useful according circumstances ; good one way injure another . And question reasoned thus : prince fear people foreigners ought build fortresses , fear foreigners people ought leave alone . The castle Milan , built Francesco Sforza , made , make , trouble house Sforza disorder state . For reason best possible fortress is—not hated people , , although may hold fortresses , yet save people hate , never wanting foreigners assist people taken arms . It seen times fortresses use prince , unless Countess Forli , [ 1 ] Count Girolamo , consort , killed ; means able withstand popular attack wait assistance Milan , thus recover state ; posture affairs time foreigners could assist people . But fortresses little value afterwards Cesare Borgia attacked , people , enemy , allied foreigners . Therefore , would safer , , hated people fortresses . All things considered , I shall praise builds fortresses well , I shall blame whoever , trusting , cares little hated people . [ 1 ] Catherine Sforza , daughter Galeazzo Sforza Lucrezia Landriani , born 1463 , died 1509 . It Countess Forli Machiavelli sent envoy 1499 . A letter Fortunati countess announces appointment : “ I signori , ” wrote Fortunati , “ learn would send . They tell Nicolo Machiavelli , learned young Florentine noble , secretary Lords Ten , leave once. ” _Cf_ . “ Catherine Sforza , ” Count Pasolini , translated P. Sylvester , 1898 . CHAPTER XXI . HOW A PRINCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF SO AS TO GAIN RENOWN Nothing makes prince much esteemed great enterprises setting fine example . We time Ferdinand Aragon , present King Spain . He almost called new prince , risen , fame glory , insignificant king foremost king Christendom ; consider deeds find great extraordinary . In beginning reign attacked Granada , enterprise foundation dominions . He quietly first without fear hindrance , held minds barons Castile occupied thinking war anticipating innovations ; thus perceive means acquiring power authority . He able money Church people sustain armies , long war lay foundation military skill since distinguished . Further , always using religion plea , undertake greater schemes , devoted pious cruelty driving clearing kingdom Moors ; could admirable example , one rare . Under cloak assailed Africa , came Italy , finally attacked France ; thus achievements designs always great , kept minds people suspense admiration occupied issue . And actions arisen way , one , men never given time work steadily . Again , much assists prince set unusual examples internal affairs , similar related Messer Bernabo da Milano , , opportunity , one civil life extraordinary thing , either good bad , would take method rewarding punishing , would much spoken . And prince ought , things , always endeavour every action gain reputation great remarkable man . A prince also respected either true friend downright enemy , say , , without reservation , declares favour one party ; course always advantageous standing neutral ; two powerful neighbours come blows , character , one conquers , either fear . In either case always advantageous declare make war strenuously ; , first case , declare , invariably fall prey conqueror , pleasure satisfaction conquered , reasons offer , anything protect shelter . Because conquers want doubtful friends aid time trial ; loses harbour willingly , sword hand , court fate . Antiochus went Greece , sent Ætolians drive Romans . He sent envoys Achaeans , friends Romans , exhorting remain neutral ; hand Romans urged take arms . This question came discussed council Achaeans , legate Antiochus urged stand neutral . To Roman legate answered : “ As said , better advantageous state interfere war , nothing erroneous ; interfering left , without favour consideration , guerdon conqueror. ” Thus always happen friend demand neutrality , whilst friend entreat declare arms . And irresolute princes , avoid present dangers , generally follow neutral path , generally ruined . But prince declares gallantly favour one side , party allies conquers , although victor may powerful may mercy , yet indebted , established bond amity ; men never shameless become monument ingratitude oppressing . Victories never complete victor must show regard , especially justice . But ally loses , may sheltered , whilst able may aid , become companions fortune may rise . In second case , fight character anxiety may conquer , much greater prudence allied , assist destruction one aid another , wise , would saved ; conquering , impossible assistance , remains discretion . And noted prince ought take care never make alliance one powerful purposes attacking others , unless necessity compels , said ; conquers discretion , princes ought avoid much possible discretion one . The Venetians joined France Duke Milan , alliance , caused ruin , could avoided . But avoided , happened Florentines Pope Spain sent armies attack Lombardy , case , reasons , prince ought favour one parties . Never let Government imagine choose perfectly safe courses ; rather let expect take doubtful ones , found ordinary affairs one never seeks avoid one trouble without running another ; prudence consists knowing distinguish character troubles , choice take lesser evil . A prince ought also show patron ability , honour proficient every art . At time encourage citizens practise callings peaceably , commerce agriculture , every following , one deterred improving possessions fear lest taken away another opening trade fear taxes ; prince ought offer rewards whoever wishes things designs way honour city state . Further , ought entertain people festivals spectacles convenient seasons year ; every city divided guilds societies , [ 1 ] ought hold bodies esteem , associate sometimes , show example courtesy liberality ; nevertheless , always maintaining majesty rank , must never consent abate anything . [ 1 ] “ Guilds societies , ” “ arti tribu. ” “ Arti ” craft trade guilds , _cf_ . Florio : “ Arte . . . whole company trade city corporation town. ” The guilds Florence admirably described Mr Edgcumbe Staley work subject ( Methuen , 1906 ) . Institutions somewhat similar character , called “ artel , ” exist Russia to-day , _cf_ . Sir Mackenzie Wallace ’ “ Russia , ” ed . 1905 : “ The sons . . . always working season members artel . In larger towns artels much complex kind— permanent associations , possessing large capital , pecuniarily responsible acts individual members. ” The word “ artel , ” despite apparent similarity , , Mr Aylmer Maude assures , connection “ ars ” “ arte. ” Its root verb “ rotisya , ” bind oneself oath ; generally admitted another form “ rota , ” signifies “ regimental company. ” In words underlying idea body men united oath . “ Tribu ” possibly gentile groups , united common descent , included individuals connected marriage . Perhaps words “ sects ” “ clans ” would appropriate . CHAPTER XXII . CONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES The choice servants little importance prince , good according discrimination prince . And first opinion one forms prince , understanding , observing men around ; capable faithful may always considered wise , known recognize capable keep faithful . But otherwise one form good opinion , prime error made choosing . There none knew Messer Antonio da Venafro servant Pandolfo Petrucci , Prince Siena , would consider Pandolfo clever man Venafro servant . Because three classes intellects : one comprehends ; another appreciates others comprehended ; third neither comprehends showing others ; first excellent , second good , third useless . Therefore , follows necessarily , Pandolfo first rank , second , whenever one judgment know good bad said done , although may initiative , yet recognize good bad servant , one praise correct ; thus servant hope deceive , kept honest . But enable prince form opinion servant one test never fails ; see servant thinking interests , seeking inwardly profit everything , man never make good servant , ever able trust ; state another hands ought never think , always prince , never pay attention matters prince concerned . On hand , keep servant honest prince ought study , honouring , enriching , kindnesses , sharing honours cares ; time let see stand alone , many honours may make desire , many riches make wish , many cares may make dread chances . When , therefore , servants , princes towards servants , thus disposed , trust , otherwise , end always disastrous either one . CHAPTER XXIII . HOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED I wish leave important branch subject , danger princes difficulty preserved , unless careful discriminating . It flatterers , courts full , men self-complacent affairs , way deceived , preserved difficulty pest , wish defend run danger falling contempt . Because way guarding oneself flatterers except letting men understand tell truth offend ; every one may tell truth , respect abates . Therefore wise prince ought hold third course choosing wise men state , giving liberty speaking truth , things inquires , none others ; ought question upon everything , listen opinions , afterwards form conclusions . With councillors , separately collectively , ought carry way know , freely shall speak , shall preferred ; outside , listen one , pursue thing resolved , steadfast resolutions . He otherwise either overthrown flatterers , often changed varying opinions falls contempt . I wish subject adduce modern example . Fra Luca , man affairs Maximilian , [ 1 ] present emperor , speaking majesty , said : He consulted one , yet never got way anything . This arose following practice opposite ; emperor secretive man—he communicate designs one , receive opinions . But carrying effect become revealed known , obstructed men around , , pliant , diverted . Hence follows things one day undoes next , one ever understands wishes intends , one rely resolutions . [ 1 ] Maximilian I , born 1459 , died 1519 , Emperor Holy Roman Empire . He married , first , Mary , daughter Charles Bold ; death , Bianca Sforza ; thus became involved Italian politics . A prince , therefore , ought always take counsel , wishes others wish ; ought rather discourage every one offering advice unless asks ; , however , ought constant inquirer , afterwards patient listener concerning things inquired ; also , learning one , consideration , told truth , let anger felt . And think prince conveys impression wisdom ability , good advisers around , beyond doubt deceived , axiom never fails : prince wise never take good advice , unless chance yielded affairs entirely one person happens prudent man . In case indeed may well governed , would long , governor would short time take away state . But prince inexperienced take counsel one never get united counsels , know unite . Each counsellors think interests , prince know control see . And found otherwise , men always prove untrue unless kept honest constraint . Therefore must inferred good counsels , whencesoever come , born wisdom prince , wisdom prince good counsels . CHAPTER XXIV . WHY THE PRINCES OF ITALY HAVE LOST THEIR STATES The previous suggestions , carefully observed , enable new prince appear well established , render secure fixed state long seated . For actions new prince narrowly observed hereditary one , seen able gain men bind far tighter ancient blood ; men attracted present past , find present good enjoy seek ; also make utmost defence prince fails things . Thus double glory established new principality , adorned strengthened good laws , good arms , good allies , good example ; double disgrace , born prince , shall lose state want wisdom . And seigniors considered lost states Italy times , King Naples , Duke Milan , others , found , firstly , one common defect regard arms causes discussed length ; next place , one seen , either people hostile , people friendly , known secure nobles . In absence defects states power enough keep army field lost . Philip Macedon , father Alexander Great , conquered Titus Quintius , much territory compared greatness Romans Greece attacked , yet warlike man knew attract people secure nobles , sustained war enemies many years , end lost dominion cities , nevertheless retained kingdom . Therefore , let princes accuse fortune loss principalities many years ’ possession , rather sloth , quiet times never thought could change ( common defect man make provision calm tempest ) , afterwards bad times came thought flight defending , hoped people , disgusted insolence conquerors , would recall . This course , others fail , may good , bad neglected expedients , since would never wish fall trusted able find someone later restore . This either happen , , , security , deliverance avail depend upon ; reliable , certain , durable depend valour . CHAPTER XXV . WHAT FORTUNE CAN EFFECT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO WITHSTAND HER It unknown many men , still , opinion affairs world wise governed fortune God men wisdom direct one even help ; would us believe necessary labour much affairs , let chance govern . This opinion credited times great changes affairs seen , may still seen , every day , beyond human conjecture . Sometimes pondering , I degree inclined opinion . Nevertheless , extinguish free , I hold true Fortune arbiter one-half actions , [ 1 ] still leaves us direct half , perhaps little less . [ 1 ] Frederick Great accustomed say : “ The older one gets convinced one becomes Majesty King Chance three-quarters business miserable universe. ” Sorel ’ “ Eastern Question . ” I compare one raging rivers , flood overflows plains , sweeping away trees buildings , bearing away soil place place ; everything flies , yield violence , without able way withstand ; yet , though nature , follow therefore men , weather becomes fair , shall make provision , defences barriers , manner , rising , waters may pass away canal , force neither unrestrained dangerous . So happens fortune , shows power valour prepared resist , thither turns forces knows barriers defences raised constrain . And consider Italy , seat changes , given impulse , see open country without barriers without defence . For defended proper valour , Germany , Spain , France , either invasion would made great changes made would come . And I consider enough say concerning resistance fortune general . But confining particular , I say prince may seen happy to-day ruined to-morrow without shown change disposition character . This , I believe , arises firstly causes already discussed length , namely , prince relies entirely fortune lost changes . I believe also successful directs actions according spirit times , whose actions accord times successful . Because men seen , affairs lead end every man , namely , glory riches , get various methods ; one caution , another haste ; one force , another skill ; one patience , another opposite ; one succeeds reaching goal different method . One also see two cautious men one attain end , fail ; similarly , two men different observances equally successful , one cautious , impetuous ; arises nothing else whether conform methods spirit times . This follows I said , two men working differently bring effect , two working similarly , one attains object . Changes estate also issue , , one governs caution patience , times affairs converge way administration successful , fortune made ; times affairs change , ruined change course action . But man often found sufficiently circumspect know accommodate change , deviate nature inclines , also , always prospered acting one way , persuaded well leave ; , therefore , cautious man , time turn adventurous , know , hence ruined ; changed conduct times fortune would changed . Pope Julius Second went work impetuously affairs , found times circumstances conform well line action always met success . Consider first enterprise Bologna , Messer Giovanni Bentivogli still alive . The Venetians agreeable , King Spain , enterprise still discussion King France ; nevertheless personally entered upon expedition accustomed boldness energy , move made Spain Venetians stand irresolute passive , latter fear , former desire recover kingdom Naples ; hand , drew King France , king , observed movement , desiring make Pope friend humble Venetians , found impossible refuse . Therefore Julius impetuous action accomplished pontiff simple human wisdom could done ; waited Rome could get away , plans arranged everything fixed , pontiff would done , would never succeeded . Because King France would made thousand excuses , others would raised thousand fears . I leave actions alone , alike , succeeded , shortness life let experience contrary ; circumstances arisen required go cautiously , ruin would followed , would never deviated ways nature inclined . I conclude , therefore , fortune changeful mankind steadfast ways , long two agreement men successful , unsuccessful fall . For part I consider better adventurous cautious , fortune woman , wish keep necessary beat ill-use ; seen allows mastered adventurous rather go work coldly . She , therefore , always , woman-like , lover young men , less cautious , violent , audacity command . CHAPTER XXVI . AN EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE BARBARIANS Having carefully considered subject discourses , wondering within whether present times propitious new prince , whether elements would give opportunity wise virtuous one introduce new order things would honour good people country , appears many things concur favour new prince I never knew time fit present . And , I said , necessary people Israel captive make manifest ability Moses ; Persians oppressed Medes discover greatness soul Cyrus ; Athenians dispersed illustrate capabilities Theseus : present time , order discover virtue Italian spirit , necessary Italy reduced extremity , enslaved Hebrews , oppressed Persians , scattered Athenians ; without head , without order , beaten , despoiled , torn , overrun ; endured every kind desolation . Although lately spark may shown one , made us think ordained God redemption , nevertheless afterwards seen , height career , fortune rejected ; Italy , left without life , waits shall yet heal wounds put end ravaging plundering Lombardy , swindling taxing kingdom Tuscany , cleanse sores long festered . It seen entreats God send someone shall deliver wrongs barbarous insolencies . It seen also ready willing follow banner someone raise . Nor seen present one place hope illustrious house , [ 1 ] valour fortune , favoured God Church chief , could made head redemption . This difficult recall actions lives men I named . And although great wonderful men , yet men , one opportunity present offers , enterprises neither easier , God friend He . [ 1 ] Giuliano de Medici . He created cardinal Leo X . In 1523 Giuliano elected Pope , took title Clement VII . With us great justice , war necessary , arms hallowed hope . Here greatest willingness , willingness great difficulties great follow men I directed attention . Further , extraordinarily ways God manifested beyond example : sea divided , cloud led way , rock poured forth water , rained manna , everything contributed greatness ; ought rest . God willing everything , thus take away free share glory belongs us . And wondered none above-named Italians able accomplish expected illustrious house ; many revolutions Italy , many campaigns , always appeared military virtue exhausted , happened old order things good , none us known find new one . And nothing honours man establish new laws new ordinances newly risen . Such things well founded dignified make revered admired , Italy wanting opportunities bring use every form . Here great valour limbs whilst fails head . Look attentively duels hand-to-hand combats , superior Italians strength , dexterity , subtlety . But comes armies bear comparison , springs entirely insufficiency leaders , since capable obedient , one seems know , never one distinguished rest , either valour fortune , others would yield . Hence long time , much fighting past twenty years , whenever army wholly Italian , always given poor account ; first witness Il Taro , afterwards Allesandria , Capua , Genoa , Vaila , Bologna , Mestri . [ 2 ] [ 2 ] The battles Il Taro , 1495 ; Alessandria , 1499 ; Capua , 1501 ; Genoa , 1507 ; Vaila , 1509 ; Bologna , 1511 ; Mestri , 1513 . If , therefore , illustrious house wishes follow remarkable men redeemed country , necessary things , true foundation every enterprise , provided forces , faithful , truer , better soldiers . And although singly good , altogether much better find commanded prince , honoured , maintained expense . Therefore necessary prepared arms , defended foreigners Italian valour . And although Swiss Spanish infantry may considered formidable , nevertheless defect , reason third order would able oppose , might relied upon overthrow . For Spaniards resist cavalry , Switzers afraid infantry whenever encounter close combat . Owing , may seen , Spaniards unable resist French cavalry , Switzers overthrown Spanish infantry . And although complete proof latter shown , nevertheless evidence battle Ravenna , Spanish infantry confronted German battalions , follow tactics Swiss ; Spaniards , agility body aid shields , got pikes Germans stood danger , able attack , Germans stood helpless , , cavalry dashed , would . It possible , therefore , knowing defects infantries , invent new one , resist cavalry afraid infantry ; need create new order arms , variation upon old . And kind improvements confer reputation power upon new prince . This opportunity , therefore , ought allowed pass letting Italy last see liberator appear . Nor one express love would received provinces suffered much foreign scourings , thirst revenge , stubborn faith , devotion , tears . What door would closed ? Who would refuse obedience ? What envy would hinder ? What Italian would refuse homage ? To us barbarous dominion stinks . Let , therefore , illustrious house take charge courage hope enterprises undertaken , standard native country may ennobled , auspices may verified saying Petrarch : Virtu contro al Furore Prendera l ’ arme , e fia il combatter corto : Che l ’ antico valore Negli italici cuor non e ancor morto . Virtue fury shall advance fight , And ’ th ’ combat soon shall put flight : For old Roman valour dead , Nor th ’ Italians ’ brests extinguished . Edward Dacre , 1640 . DESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE DUKE VALENTINO WHEN MURDERING VITELLOZZO VITELLI , OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO , THE SIGNOR PAGOLO , AND THE DUKE DI GRAVINA ORSINI BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI The Duke Valentino returned Lombardy , clear King France calumnies raised Florentines concerning rebellion Arezzo towns Val di Chiana , arrived Imola , whence intended army enter upon campaign Giovanni Bentivogli , tyrant Bologna : intended bring city domination , make head Romagnian duchy . These matters coming knowledge Vitelli Orsini following , appeared duke would become powerful , feared , seized Bologna , would seek destroy order might become supreme Italy . Upon meeting called Magione district Perugia , came cardinal , Pagolo , Duke di Gravina Orsini , Vitellozzo Vitelli , Oliverotto da Fermo , Gianpagolo Baglioni , tyrant Perugia , Messer Antonio da Venafro , sent Pandolfo Petrucci , Prince Siena . Here discussed power courage duke necessity curbing ambitions , might otherwise bring danger rest ruined . And decided abandon Bentivogli , strive win Florentines ; sent men one place another , promising one party assistance another encouragement unite common enemy . This meeting reported throughout Italy , discontented duke , among people Urbino , took hope effecting revolution . Thus arose , men ’ minds thus unsettled , decided certain men Urbino seize fortress San Leo , held duke , captured following means . The castellan fortifying rock causing timber taken ; conspirators watched , certain beams carried rock upon bridge , prevented drawn inside , took opportunity leaping upon bridge thence fortress . Upon capture effected , whole state rebelled recalled old duke , encouraged , much capture fort , Diet Magione , expected get assistance . Those heard rebellion Urbino thought would lose opportunity , assembled men take town , remain hands duke state ; sent Florence beg republic join destroying common firebrand , showing risk lessened ought wait another opportunity . But Florentines , hatred , sundry reasons , Vitelli Orsini , would ally , sent Nicolo Machiavelli , secretary , offer shelter assistance duke enemies . The duke found full fear Imola , , everybody ’ expectation , soldiers gone enemy found disarmed war door . But recovering courage offers Florentines , decided temporize fighting soldiers remained , negotiate reconciliation , also get assistance . This latter obtained two ways , sending King France men enlisting men-at-arms others turned cavalry sort : gave money . Notwithstanding , enemies drew near , approached Fossombrone , encountered men duke , aid Orsini Vitelli , routed . When happened , duke resolved see could close trouble offers reconciliation , perfect dissembler fail practices make insurgents understand wished every man acquired anything keep , enough title prince , whilst others might principality . And duke succeeded well sent Signor Pagolo negotiate reconciliation , brought army standstill . But duke stop preparations , took every care provide cavalry infantry , preparations might apparent others , sent troops separate parties every part Romagna . In meanwhile came also five hundred French lancers , although found sufficiently strong take vengeance enemies open war , considered would safer advantageous outwit , reason stop work reconciliation . And might effected duke concluded peace confirmed former covenants ; gave four thousand ducats ; promised injure Bentivogli ; formed alliance Giovanni ; moreover would force come personally presence unless pleased . On hand , promised restore duchy Urbino places seized , serve expeditions , make war ally one without permission . This reconciliation completed , Guido Ubaldo , Duke Urbino , fled Venice , first destroyed fortresses state ; , trusting people , wish fortresses , think could defend , held enemy , since means check would kept upon friends . But Duke Valentino , completed convention , dispersed men throughout Romagna , set Imola end November together French men-at-arms : thence went Cesena , stayed time negotiate envoys Vitelli Orsini , assembled men duchy Urbino , enterprise take part ; nothing concluded , Oliverotto da Fermo sent propose duke wished undertake expedition Tuscany ready ; wish , would besiege Sinigalia . To duke replied wish enter war Tuscany , thus become hostile Florentines , willing proceed Sinigalia . It happened long afterwards town surrendered , fortress would yield castellan would give one duke person ; therefore exhorted come . This appeared good opportunity duke , , invited , going , would awaken suspicions . And reassure , allowed French men-at-arms Lombardy depart , except hundred lancers Mons . di Candales , brother-in-law . He left Cesena middle December , went Fano , utmost cunning cleverness persuaded Vitelli Orsini wait Sinigalia , pointing lack compliance would cast doubt upon sincerity permanency reconciliation , man wished make use arms councils friends . But Vitellozzo remained stubborn , death brother warned offend prince afterwards trust ; nevertheless , persuaded Pagolo Orsini , duke corrupted gifts promises , agreed wait . Upon duke , departure Fano , 30th December 1502 , communicated designs eight trusted followers , among Don Michele Monsignor ’ Euna , afterwards cardinal ; ordered , soon Vitellozzo , Pagolo Orsini , Duke di Gravina , Oliverotto arrive , followers pairs take one one , entrusting certain men certain pairs , entertain reached Sinigalia ; permitted leave came duke ’ quarters , seized . The duke afterwards ordered horsemen infantry , two thousand cavalry ten thousand footmen , assemble daybreak Metauro , river five miles distant Fano , await . He found , therefore , last day December Metauro men , sent cavalcade two hundred horsemen , moved forward infantry , accompanied rest men-at-arms . Fano Sinigalia two cities La Marca situated shore Adriatic Sea , fifteen miles distant , goes towards Sinigalia mountains right hand , bases touched sea places . The city Sinigalia distant foot mountains little bow-shot shore mile . On side opposite city runs little river bathes part walls looking towards Fano , facing high road . Thus draws near Sinigalia comes good space road along mountains , reaches river passes Sinigalia . If turns left hand along bank , goes distance bow-shot , arrives bridge crosses river ; almost abreast gate leads Sinigalia , straight line , transversely . Before gate stands collection houses square bank river forms one side . The Vitelli Orsini received orders wait duke , honour person , sent away men several castles distant Sinigalia six miles , room could made men duke ; left Sinigalia Oliverotto band , consisted one thousand infantry one hundred fifty horsemen , quartered suburb mentioned . Matters thus arranged , Duke Valentino left Sinigalia , leaders cavalry reached bridge pass , opened , one portion wheeled towards river towards country , way left middle infantry passed , without stopping , town . Vitellozzo , Pagolo , Duke di Gravina mules , accompanied horsemen , went towards duke ; Vitellozo , unarmed wearing cape lined green , appeared dejected , conscious approaching death—a circumstance , view ability man former fortune , caused amazement . And said parted men setting Sinigalia meet duke acted last parting . He recommended house fortunes captains , advised nephews fortune house , virtues fathers kept mind . These three , therefore , came duke saluted respectfully , received goodwill ; placed commissioned look . But duke noticing Oliverotto , remained band Sinigalia , missing—for Oliverotto waiting square quarters near river , keeping men order drilling them—signalled eye Don Michelle , care Oliverotto committed , take measures Oliverotto escape . Therefore Don Michele rode joined Oliverotto , telling right keep men quarters , might taken men duke ; advised send quarters come meet duke .

After news , 18th January 1502 , castle Pieve , also strangled way . THE LIFE OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI OF LUCCA WRITTEN BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI And sent friends ZANOBI BUONDELMONTI And LUIGI ALAMANNI CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI 1284-1328 It appears , dearest Zanobi Luigi , wonderful thing considered matter , men , larger number , performed great deeds world , excelled others day , birth beginning baseness obscurity ; aggrieved Fortune outrageous way . They either exposed mercy wild beasts , mean parentage shame given sons Jove deity . It would wearisome relate persons may well known everybody , , tales would particularly edifying read , omitted . I believe lowly beginnings great men occur Fortune desirous showing world men owe much little wisdom , begins show hand wisdom really take part career : thus success must attributed . Castruccio Castracani Lucca one men great deeds , measured times lived city born ; , like many others , neither fortunate distinguished birth , course history show . It appeared desirable recall memory , I discerned indications valour fortune make great exemplar men . I think also I ought call attention actions , men I know delight noble deeds . The family Castracani formerly numbered among noble families Lucca , days I speak somewhat fallen estate , often happens world . To family born son Antonio , became priest order San Michele Lucca , reason honoured title Messer Antonio . He sister , married Buonaccorso Cenami , Buonaccorso dying became widow , wishing marry went live brother . Messer Antonio vineyard behind house resided , bounded sides gardens , person could access without difficulty . One morning , shortly sunrise , Madonna Dianora , sister Messer Antonio called , occasion go vineyard usual gather herbs seasoning dinner , hearing slight rustling among leaves vine turned eyes direction , heard something resembling cry infant . Whereupon went towards , saw hands face baby lying enveloped leaves seemed crying mother . Partly wondering partly fearing , yet full compassion , lifted carried house , washed clothed clean linen customary , showed Messer Antonio returned home . When heard happened saw child less surprised compassionate sister . They discussed done , seeing priest children , finally determined bring . They nurse , reared loved child . They baptized , gave name Castruccio father . As years passed Castruccio grew handsome , gave evidence wit discretion , learnt quickness beyond years lessons Messer Antonio imparted . Messer Antonio intended make priest , time would inducted canonry benefices , instruction given object ; Antonio discovered character Castruccio quite unfitted priesthood . As soon Castruccio reached age fourteen began take less notice chiding Messer Antonio Madonna Dianora longer fear ; left reading ecclesiastical books , turned playing arms , delighting nothing much learning uses , running , leaping , wrestling boys . In exercises far excelled companions courage bodily strength , time turn books , pleased told wars mighty deeds men . Messer Antonio beheld vexation sorrow . There lived city Lucca gentleman Guinigi family , named Messer Francesco , whose profession arms riches , bodily strength , valour excelled men Lucca . He often fought command Visconti Milan , Ghibelline valued leader party Lucca . This gentleman resided Lucca accustomed assemble others mornings evenings balcony Podesta , top square San Michele , finest square Lucca , often seen Castruccio taking part children street games I spoken . Noticing Castruccio far excelled boys , appeared exercise royal authority , loved obeyed , Messer Francesco became greatly desirous learning . Being informed circumstances bringing Castruccio felt greater desire near . Therefore called one day asked whether would willingly live house gentleman , would learn ride horses use arms , house priest , would learn nothing masses services Church . Messer Francesco could see pleased Castruccio greatly hear horses arms spoken , even though stood silent , blushing modestly ; encouraged Messer Francesco speak , answered , master agreeable , nothing would please give priestly studies take soldier . This reply delighted Messer Francesco , short time obtained consent Messer Antonio , driven yield knowledge nature lad , fear would able hold much longer . Thus Castruccio passed house Messer Antonio priest house Messer Francesco Guinigi soldier , astonishing find short time manifested virtue bearing accustomed associate true gentleman . In first place became accomplished horseman , could manage ease fiery charger , jousts tournaments , although still youth , observed beyond others , excelled exercises strength dexterity . But enhanced much charm accomplishments , delightful modesty enabled avoid offence either act word others , deferential great men , modest equals , courteous inferiors . These gifts made beloved , Guinigi family , Lucca . When Castruccio reached eighteenth year , Ghibellines driven Pavia Guelphs , Messer Francesco sent Visconti assist Ghibellines , went Castruccio , charge forces . Castruccio gave ample proof prudence courage expedition , acquiring greater reputation captain , name fame known , Pavia , throughout Lombardy . Castruccio , returned Lucca far higher estimation left , omit use means power gain many friends could , neglecting none arts necessary purpose . About time Messer Francesco died , leaving son thirteen years age named Pagolo , appointed Castruccio son ’ tutor administrator estate . Before died Francesco called Castruccio , prayed show Pagolo goodwill ( Francesco ) always shown HIM , render son gratitude able repay father . Upon death Francesco , Castruccio became governor tutor Pagolo , increased enormously power position , created certain amount envy Lucca place former universal goodwill , many men suspected harbouring tyrannical intentions . Among leading man Giorgio degli Opizi , head Guelph party . This man hoped death Messer Francesco become chief man Lucca , seemed Castruccio , great abilities already showed , holding position governor , deprived opportunity ; therefore began sow seeds rob Castruccio eminence . Castruccio first treated scorn , afterwards grew alarmed , thinking Messer Giorgio might able bring disgrace deputy King Ruberto Naples driven Lucca . The Lord Pisa time Uguccione Faggiuola Arezzo , first place elected captain afterwards became lord . There resided Paris exiled Ghibellines Lucca , Castruccio held communications object effecting restoration help Uguccione . Castruccio also brought plans friends Lucca would endure authority Opizi . Having fixed upon plan followed , Castruccio cautiously fortified tower Onesti , filling supplies munitions war , order might stand siege days case need . When night came agreed upon Uguccione , occupied plain mountains Pisa many men , signal given , without observed Uguccione approached gate San Piero set fire portcullis . Castruccio raised great uproar within city , calling people arms forcing open gate side . Uguccione entered men , poured town , killed Messer Giorgio family many friends supporters . The governor driven , government reformed according wishes Uguccione , detriment city , found one hundred families exiled time . Of fled , part went Florence part Pistoia , city headquarters Guelph party , reason became hostile Uguccione Lucchese . As appeared Florentines others Guelph party Ghibellines absorbed much power Tuscany , determined restore exiled Guelphs Lucca . They assembled large army Val di Nievole , seized Montecatini ; thence marched Montecarlo , order secure free passage Lucca . Upon Uguccione assembled Pisan Lucchese forces , number German cavalry drew Lombardy , moved quarters Florentines , upon appearance enemy withdrew Montecarlo , posted Montecatini Pescia . Uguccione took position near Montecarlo , within two miles enemy , slight skirmishes horse parties daily occurrence . Owing illness Uguccione , Pisans Lucchese delayed coming battle enemy . Uguccione , finding growing worse , went Montecarlo cured , left command army hands Castruccio . This change brought ruin Guelphs , , thinking hostile army lost captain lost head , grew over-confident . Castruccio observed , allowed days pass order encourage belief ; also showed signs fear , allow munitions camp used . On side , Guelphs grew insolent saw evidences fear , every day drew order battle front army Castruccio . Presently , deeming enemy sufficiently emboldened , mastered tactics , decided join battle . First spoke words encouragement soldiers , pointed certainty victory would obey commands . Castruccio noticed enemy placed best troops centre line battle , less reliable men wings army ; whereupon exactly opposite , putting valiant men flanks , could strongly rely moved centre . Observing order battle , drew lines quickly came sight hostile army , , usual , come insolence defy . He commanded centre squadrons march slowly , whilst moved rapidly forward wings . Thus , came contact enemy , wings two armies became engaged , whilst center battalions remained action , two portions line battle separated long interval thus unable reach . By expedient valiant part Castruccio ’ men opposed weaker part enemy ’ troops , efficient men enemy disengaged ; thus Florentines unable fight arrayed opposite , give assistance flanks . So , without much difficulty , Castruccio put enemy flight flanks , centre battalions took flight found exposed attack , without chance displaying valour . The defeat complete , loss men heavy , ten thousand men killed many officers knights Guelph party Tuscany , also many princes come help , among Piero , brother King Ruberto , Carlo , nephew , Filippo , lord Taranto . On part Castruccio loss amount three hundred men , among Francesco , son Uguccione , , young rash , killed first onset . This victory greatly increased reputation Castruccio Uguccione conceived jealousy suspicion , appeared Uguccione victory given increase power , rather diminished . Being mind , waited opportunity give effect . This occurred death Pier Agnolo Micheli , man great repute abilities Lucca , murderer fled house Castruccio refuge . On sergeants captain going arrest murderer , driven Castruccio , murderer escaped . This affair coming knowledge Uguccione , Pisa , appeared proper opportunity punish Castruccio . He therefore sent son Neri , governor Lucca , commissioned take Castruccio prisoner banquet put death . Castruccio , fearing evil , went governor friendly way , entertained supper , thrown prison . But Neri , fearing put death lest people incensed , kept alive , order hear father concerning intentions . Ugucionne cursed hesitation cowardice son , set Pisa Lucca four hundred horsemen finish business way ; yet reached baths Pisans rebelled put deputy death created Count Gaddo della Gherardesca lord . Before Uguccione reached Lucca heard occurrences Pisa , appear wise turn back , lest Lucchese example Pisa close gates . But Lucchese , heard happened Pisa , availed opportunity demand liberation Castruccio , notwithstanding Uguccione arrived city . They first began speak private circles , afterwards openly squares streets ; raised tumult , arms hands went Uguccione demanded Castruccio set liberty . Uguccione , fearing worse might happen , released prison . Whereupon Castruccio gathered friends around , help people attacked Uguccione ; , finding resource flight , rode away friends Lombardy , lords Scale , died poverty . But Castruccio prisoner became almost prince Lucca , carried discreetly friends people appointed captain army one year . Having obtained , wishing gain renown war , planned recovery many towns rebelled departure Uguccione , help Pisans , concluded treaty , marched Serezzana . To capture place constructed fort , called to-day Zerezzanello ; course two months Castruccio captured town . With reputation gained siege , rapidly seized Massa , Carrara , Lavenza , short time overrun whole Lunigiana . In order close pass leads Lombardy Lunigiana , besieged Pontremoli wrested hands Messer Anastagio Palavicini , lord . After victory returned Lucca , welcomed whole people . And Castruccio , deeming imprudent longer defer making prince , got created lord Lucca help Pazzino del Poggio , Puccinello dal Portico , Francesco Boccansacchi , Cecco Guinigi , corrupted ; afterwards solemnly deliberately elected prince people . At time Frederick Bavaria , King Romans , came Italy assume Imperial crown , Castruccio , order might make friends , met head five hundred horsemen . Castruccio left deputy Lucca , Pagolo Guinigi , held high estimation , people ’ love memory father . Castruccio received great honour Frederick , many privileges conferred upon , appointed emperor ’ lieutenant Tuscany . At time Pisans great fear Gaddo della Gherardesca , driven Pisa , recourse assistance Frederick . Frederick created Castruccio lord Pisa , Pisans , dread Guelph party , particularly Florentines , constrained accept lord . Frederick , appointed governor Rome watch Italian affairs , returned Germany . All Tuscan Lombardian Ghibellines , followed imperial lead , recourse Castruccio help counsel , promised governorship country , enabled recover assistance . Among exiles Matteo Guidi , Nardo Scolari , Lapo Uberti , Gerozzo Nardi , Piero Buonaccorsi , exiled Florentines Ghibellines . Castruccio secret intention becoming master Tuscany aid men forces ; order gain greater weight affairs , entered league Messer Matteo Visconti , Prince Milan , organized forces city country districts . As Lucca five gates , divided country districts five parts , supplied arms , enrolled men captains ensigns , could quickly bring field twenty thousand soldiers , without could summon assistance Pisa . While surrounded forces allies , happened Messer Matteo Visconti attacked Guelphs Piacenza , driven Ghibellines assistance Florentine army King Ruberto . Messer Matteo called upon Castruccio invade Florentines territories , , attacked home , compelled draw army Lombardy order defend . Castruccio invaded Valdarno , seized Fucecchio San Miniato , inflicting immense damage upon country . Whereupon Florentines recalled army , scarcely reached Tuscany , Castruccio forced necessities return Lucca . There resided city Lucca Poggio family , powerful could elevate Castruccio , even advance dignity prince ; appearing received rewards services deserved , incited families rebel drive Castruccio Lucca . They found opportunity one morning , arming , set upon lieutenant Castruccio left maintain order killed . They endeavoured raise people revolt , Stefano di Poggio , peaceable old man taken hand rebellion , intervened compelled authority lay arms ; offered mediator Castruccio obtain desired . Therefore laid arms greater intelligence taken . Castruccio , heard news happened Lucca , put Pagolo Guinigi command army , troop cavalry set home . Contrary expectations , found rebellion end , yet posted men advantageous places throughout city . As appeared Stefano Castruccio ought much obliged , sought , without saying anything behalf , recognize need , begged Castruccio pardon members family reason youth , former friendships , obligations Castruccio house . To Castruccio graciously responded , begged Stefano reassure , declaring gave pleasure find tumult end ever caused anxiety hear inception . He encouraged Stefano bring family , saying thanked God given opportunity showing clemency liberality . Upon word Stefano Castruccio surrendered , Stefano immediately thrown prison put death . Meanwhile Florentines recovered San Miniato , whereupon seemed advisable Castruccio make peace , appear sufficiently secure Lucca leave . He approached Florentines proposal truce , readily entertained , weary war , desirous getting rid expenses . A treaty concluded two years , parties agreed keep conquests made . Castruccio thus released trouble , turned attention affairs Lucca , order subject perils escaped , , various pretences reasons , first wiped ambition might aspire principality ; sparing one , depriving country property , hands life also , stating found experience none trusted . Then security raised fortress Lucca stones towers killed hunted state . Whilst Castruccio made peace Florentines , strengthened position Lucca , neglected opportunity , short open war , increasing importance elsewhere . It appeared could get possession Pistoia , would one foot Florence , great desire . He , therefore , various ways made friends mountaineers , worked matters Pistoia parties confided secrets . Pistoia divided , always , Bianchi Neri parties ; head Bianchi Bastiano di Possente , Neri , Jacopo da Gia . Each men held secret communications Castruccio , desired drive city ; , many threatenings , came blows . Jacopo fortified Florentine gate , Bastiano Lucchese side city ; trusted Castruccio Florentines , believed Castruccio far ready willing fight Florentines , sent assistance . He gave promises , saying Bastiano would come person , Jacopo would send pupil , Pagolo Guinigi . At appointed time sent forward Pagolo way Pisa , went direct Pistoia ; midnight met outside city , admitted friends . Thus two leaders entered , signal given Castruccio , one killed Jacopo da Gia , Bastiano di Possente , took prisoners killed partisans either faction . Without opposition Pistoia passed hands Castruccio , , forced Signoria leave palace , compelled people yield obedience , making many promises remitting old debts . The countryside flocked city see new prince , filled hope quickly settled , influenced great measure great valour . About time great disturbances arose Rome , owing dearness living caused absence pontiff Avignon . The German governor , Enrico , much blamed happened—murders tumults following daily , without able put end . This caused Enrico much anxiety lest Romans call Ruberto , King Naples , would drive Germans city , bring back Pope . Having nearer friend could apply help Castruccio , sent , begging give assistance , also come person Rome . Castruccio considered ought hesitate render emperor service , believed would safe time emperor ceased hold Rome . Leaving Pagolo Guinigi command Lucca , Castruccio set Rome six hundred horsemen , received Enrico greatest distinction . In short time presence Castruccio obtained respect emperor , without bloodshed violence , good order restored , chiefly reason Castruccio sent sea country round Pisa large quantities corn , thus removed source trouble . When chastised Roman leaders , admonished others , voluntary obedience rendered Enrico . Castruccio received many honours , made Roman senator . This dignity assumed greatest pomp , Castruccio clothed brocaded toga , following words embroidered front : “ I God wills. ” Whilst back : “ What God desires shall . ” During time Florentines , much enraged Castruccio seized Pistoia truce , considered could tempt city rebel , thought would difficult absence . Among exiled Pistoians Florence Baldo Cecchi Jacopo Baldini , men leading ready face danger . These men kept communications friends Pistoia , aid Florentines entered city night , driving Castruccio ’ officials partisans , killing others , restored city freedom . The news greatly angered Castruccio , taking leave Enrico , pressed great haste Pistoia . When Florentines heard return , knowing would lose time , decided intercept forces Val di Nievole , belief would cut road Pistoia . Assembling great army supporters Guelph cause , Florentines entered Pistoian territories . On hand , Castruccio reached Montecarlo army ; heard Florentines ’ lay , decided encounter plains Pistoia , await plains Pescia , , far possibly could , attack boldly Pass Serravalle . He believed succeeded design , victory assured , although informed Florentines thirty thousand men , whilst twelve thousand . Although every confidence abilities valour troops , yet hesitated attack enemy open lest overwhelmed numbers . Serravalle castle Pescia Pistoia , situated hill blocks Val di Nievole , exact pass , bowshot beyond ; pass places narrow steep , whilst general ascends gently , still narrow , especially summit waters divide , twenty men side side could hold . The lord Serravalle Manfred , German , , Castruccio became lord Pistoia , allowed remain possession castle , common Lucchese Pistoians , unclaimed either—neither wishing displace Manfred long kept promise neutrality , came obligations one . For reasons , also castle well fortified , always able maintain position . It Castruccio determined fall upon enemy , men would advantage , fear lest , seeing large masses hostile force became engaged , stand . As soon trouble Florence arose , Castruccio saw immense advantage possession castle would give , intimate friendship resident castle , managed matters four hundred men admitted castle night attack Florentines , castellan put death . Castruccio , prepared everything , encourage Florentines persist desire carry seat war away Pistoia Val di Nievole , therefore move army Montecarlo . Thus Florentines hurried reached encampment Serravalle , intending cross hill following morning . In meantime , Castruccio seized castle night , also moved army Montecarlo , marching thence midnight dead silence , reached foot Serravalle : thus Florentines commenced ascent hill time morning . Castruccio sent forward infantry main road , troop four hundred horsemen path left towards castle . The Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead army following , never expecting find Castruccio possession hill , aware seized castle . Thus happened Florentine horsemen mounting hill completely taken surprise discovered infantry Castruccio , close upon scarcely time pull visors . It case unready soldiers attacked ready , assailed vigour difficulty could hold , although got . When noise fighting reached Florentine camp , filled confusion . The cavalry infantry became inextricably mixed : captains unable get men either backward forward , owing narrowness pass , amid tumult one knew ought done could done . In short time cavalry engaged enemy ’ infantry scattered killed without made effective defence unfortunate position , although sheer desperation offered stout resistance . Retreat impossible , mountains flanks , whilst front enemies , rear friends . When Castruccio saw men unable strike decisive blow enemy put flight , sent one thousand infantrymen round castle , orders join four hundred horsemen previously dispatched , commanded whole force fall upon flank enemy . These orders carried fury Florentines could sustain attack , gave way , soon full retreat—conquered unfortunate position valour enemy . Those rear turned towards Pistoia , spread plains , man seeking safety . The defeat complete sanguinary . Many captains taken prisoners , among Bandini dei Rossi , Francesco Brunelleschi , Giovanni della Tosa , Florentine noblemen , many Tuscans Neapolitans fought Florentine side , sent King Ruberto assist Guelphs . Immediately Pistoians heard defeat drove friends Guelphs , surrendered Castruccio . He content occupying Prato castles plains sides Arno , marched army plain Peretola , two miles Florence . Here remained many days , dividing spoils , celebrating victory feasts games , holding horse races , foot races men women . He also struck medals commemoration defeat Florentines . He endeavoured corrupt citizens Florence , open city gates night ; conspiracy discovered , participators taken beheaded , among Tommaso Lupacci Lambertuccio Frescobaldi . This defeat caused Florentines great anxiety , despairing preserving liberty , sent envoys King Ruberto Naples , offering dominion city ; , knowing immense importance maintenance Guelph cause , accepted . He agreed Florentines receive yearly tribute two hundred thousand florins , sent son Carlo Florence four thousand horsemen . Shortly Florentines relieved degree pressure Castruccio ’ army , owing compelled leave positions Florence march Pisa , order suppress conspiracy raised Benedetto Lanfranchi , one first men Pisa , could endure fatherland dominion Lucchese . He formed conspiracy , intending seize citadel , kill partisans Castruccio , drive garrison . As , however , conspiracy paucity numbers essential secrecy , execution sufficient , seeking adherents conspiracy Lanfranchi encountered person revealed design Castruccio . This betrayal passed without severe reproach Bonifacio Cerchi Giovanni Guidi , two Florentine exiles suffering banishment Pisa . Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto put death , beheaded many noble citizens , drove families exile . It appeared Castruccio Pisa Pistoia thoroughly disaffected ; employed much thought energy upon securing position , gave Florentines opportunity reorganize army , await coming Carlo , son King Naples . When Carlo arrived decided lose time , assembled great army thirty thousand infantry ten thousand cavalry—having called aid every Guelph Italy . They consulted whether attack Pistoia Pisa first , decided would better march latter—a course , owing recent conspiracy , likely succeed , advantage , believed surrender Pistoia would follow acquisition Pisa . In early part May 1328 , Florentines put motion army quickly occupied Lastra , Signa , Montelupo , Empoli , passing thence San Miniato . When Castruccio heard enormous army Florentines sending , degree alarmed , believing time arrived Fortune would deliver empire Tuscany hands , reason think enemy would make better fight , better prospects success , Pisa Serravalle . He assembled twenty thousand foot soldiers four thousand horsemen , army went Fucecchio , whilst sent Pagolo Guinigi Pisa five thousand infantry . Fucecchio stronger position town Pisan district , owing situation rivers Arno Gusciana slight elevation surrounding plain . Moreover , enemy could hinder victualled unless divided forces , could approach either direction Lucca Pisa , could get Pisa , attack Castruccio ’ forces except disadvantage . In one case would find placed two armies , one command Pagolo , case would cross Arno get close quarters enemy , undertaking great hazard . In order tempt Florentines take latter course , Castruccio withdrew men banks river placed walls Fucecchio , leaving wide expanse land river . The Florentines , occupied San Miniato , held council war decide whether attack Pisa army Castruccio , , weighed difficulties courses , decided upon latter . The river Arno time low enough fordable , yet water reached shoulders infantrymen saddles horsemen . On morning 10 June 1328 , Florentines commenced battle ordering forward number cavalry ten thousand infantry . Castruccio , whose plan action fixed , well knew , attacked Florentines five thousand infantry three thousand horsemen , allowing issue river charged ; also sent one thousand light infantry river bank , number Arno . The infantry Florentines much impeded arms water able mount banks river , whilst cavalry made passage river difficult others , reason crossed broken bed river , deep mud , many horses rolled riders many stuck fast could move . When Florentine captains saw difficulties men meeting , withdrew moved higher river , hoping find river bed less treacherous banks adapted landing . These men met bank forces Castruccio already sent forward , , light armed bucklers javelins hands , let fly tremendous shouts faces bodies cavalry . The horses , alarmed noise wounds , would move forward , trampled great confusion . The fight men Castruccio enemy succeeded crossing sharp terrible ; sides fought utmost desperation neither would yield . The soldiers Castruccio fought drive others back river , whilst Florentines strove get footing land order make room others pressing forward , could get water would able fight , obstinate conflict urged captains . Castruccio shouted men enemies conquered Serravalle , whilst Florentines reproached many overcome . At length Castruccio , seeing long battle lasted , men enemy utterly exhausted , sides many killed wounded , pushed forward another body infantry take position rear fighting ; commanded latter open ranks intended retreat , one part turn right another left . This cleared space Florentines took advantage , thus gained possession portion battlefield . But tired soldiers found close quarters Castruccio ’ reserves could stand fell back river . The cavalry either side yet gained decisive advantage , Castruccio , knowing inferiority arm , commanded leaders stand defensive attacks adversaries , hoped overcome infantry would able make short work cavalry . This fell hoped , saw Florentine army driven back across river ordered remainder infantry attack cavalry enemy . This lance javelin , , joined cavalry , fell upon enemy greatest fury soon put flight . The Florentine captains , seen difficulty cavalry met crossing river , attempted make infantry cross lower river , order attack flanks Castruccio ’ army . But , also , banks steep already lined men Castruccio , movement quite useless . Thus Florentines completely defeated points scarcely third escaped , Castruccio covered glory . Many captains taken prisoners , Carlo , son King Ruberto , Michelagnolo Falconi Taddeo degli Albizzi , Florentine commissioners , fled Empoli . If spoils great , slaughter infinitely greater , might expected battle . Of Florentines fell twenty thousand two hundred thirty-one men , whilst Castruccio lost one thousand five hundred seventy men . But Fortune growing envious glory Castruccio took away life time preserved , thus ruined plans long time worked carry effect , successful prosecution nothing death could stopped . Castruccio thick battle whole day ; end came , although fatigued overheated , stood gate Fucecchio welcome men return victory personally thank . He also watch attempt enemy retrieve fortunes day ; opinion duty good general first man saddle last . Here Castruccio stood exposed wind often rises midday banks Arno , often unhealthy ; took chill , thought nothing , accustomed troubles ; cause death . On following night attacked high fever , increased rapidly doctors saw must prove fatal . Castruccio , therefore , called Pagolo Guinigi , addressed follows : “ If I could believed Fortune would cut midst career leading glory successes promised , I laboured less , I left thee , smaller state , least fewer enemies perils , I content governorships Lucca Pisa . I neither subjugated Pistoians , outraged Florentines many injuries . But I would made peoples friends , I lived , longer , least peacefully , left state without doubt smaller , one secure established surer foundation . But Fortune , insists upon arbitrament human affairs , endow sufficient judgment recognize first , time surmount . Thou hast heard , many told thee , I never concealed , I entered house thy father whilst yet boy—a stranger ambitions every generous soul feel—and I brought , loved though I born blood ; governance I learned valiant capable availing fortune , thou hast witness . When thy good father came die , committed thee possessions care , I brought thee love , increased thy estate care , I bound show . And order thou shouldst possess estate thy father left , also fortune abilities gained , I never married , love children never deflect mind gratitude I owed children thy father . Thus I leave thee vast estate , I well content , I deeply concerned , inasmuch I leave thee unsettled insecure . Thou hast city Lucca thy hands , never rest contented thy government . Thou hast also Pisa , men nature changeable unreliable , , although may sometimes held subjection , yet ever disdain serve Lucchese . Pistoia also disloyal thee , eaten factions deeply incensed thy family reason wrongs recently inflicted upon . Thou hast neighbours offended Florentines , injured us thousand ways , utterly destroyed , hail news death delight would acquisition Tuscany . In Emperor princes Milan thou canst place reliance , far distant , slow , help long coming . Therefore , thou hast hope anything thine abilities , memory valour , prestige latest victory brought thee ; , thou knowest use prudence , assist thee come terms Florentines , , suffering great defeat , inclined listen thee . And whereas I sought make enemies , I believed war would conduce power glory , thou hast every inducement make friends , alliance bring thee advantages security . It greatest important world man know , measure strength means ; knows genius fighting must learn govern arts peace . And well thee rule thy conduct counsel , learn way enjoy life-work dangers gained ; thou wilt easily succeed thou hast learnt believe I told thee true . And thou wilt doubly indebted , I left thee realm taught thee keep . ” After came Castruccio citizens Pisa , Pistoia , Lucca , fighting side , whilst recommending Pagolo , making swear obedience successor , died . He left happy memory known , prince times ever loved devotion . His obsequies celebrated every sign mourning , buried San Francesco Lucca . Fortune friendly Pagolo Guinigi Castruccio , abilities . Not long death Castruccio , Pagolo lost Pisa , Pistoia , difficulty held Lucca . This latter city continued family Guinigi time great-grandson Pagolo . From related seen Castruccio man exceptional abilities , measured men time , also earlier date . In stature ordinary height , perfectly proportioned . He gracious presence , welcomed men urbanity spoke rarely left displeased . His hair inclined red , wore cut short ears , , whether rained snowed , always went without hat . He delightful among friends , terrible enemies ; subjects ; ready play false unfaithful , willing overcome fraud desired subdue , wont say victory brought glory , methods achieving . No one bolder facing danger , none prudent extricating . He accustomed say men ought attempt everything fear nothing ; God lover strong men , one always sees weak chastised strong . He also wonderfully sharp biting though courteous answers ; look indulgence way speaking others , angered others show . It often happened listened quietly others spoken sharply , following occasions . He caused ducat given partridge , taken task friend , Castruccio said : “ You would given penny . ” “ That true , ” answered friend . Then said Castruccio : “ A ducat much less me. ” Having flatterer spat show scorned , flatterer said : “ Fisherman willing let waters sea saturate order may take little fishes , I allow wetted spittle I may catch whale ” ; heard Castruccio patience rewarded . When told priest wicked live sumptuously , Castruccio said : “ If vice fare splendidly feasts saints. ” Passing street saw young man came house ill fame blush seen Castruccio , said : “ Thou shouldst ashamed thou comest , thou goest places. ” A friend gave curiously tied knot undo told : “ Fool , think I wish untie thing gave much trouble fasten. ” Castruccio said one professed philosopher : “ You like dogs always run give best eat , ” answered : “ We rather like doctors go houses greatest need them. ” Going water Pisa Leghorn , Castruccio much disturbed dangerous storm sprang , reproached cowardice one , said fear anything . Castruccio answered wonder , since every man valued soul worth . Being asked one ought gain estimation , said : “ When thou goest banquet take care thou dost seat one piece wood upon another. ” To person boasting read many things , Castruccio said : “ He knows better boast remembering many things. ” Someone bragged could drink much without becoming intoxicated . Castruccio replied : “ An ox same. ” Castruccio acquainted girl intimate relations , blamed friend told undignified taken woman , said : “ She taken , I taken her. ” Being also blamed eating dainty foods , answered : “ Thou dost spend much I ? ” told true , continued : “ Then thou art avaricious I gluttonous . ” Being invited Taddeo Bernardi , rich splendid citizen Luca , supper , went house shown Taddeo chamber hung silk paved fine stones representing flowers foliage beautiful colouring . Castruccio gathered saliva mouth spat upon Taddeo , seeing much disturbed , said : “ I knew spit order offend thee less. ” Being asked Caesar died said : “ God willing I die did. ” Being one night house one gentlemen many ladies assembled , reproved one friends dancing amusing usual one station , said : “ He considered wise day considered fool night. ” A person came demand favour Castruccio , thinking listening plea threw knees ground , sharply reproved Castruccio , said : “ Thou art reason acting thus thou hast thy ears thy feet , ” whereupon obtained double favour asked . Castruccio used say way hell easy one , seeing downward direction travelled blindfolded . Being asked favour one used many superfluous words , said : “ When another request make , send someone else make it. ” Having wearied similar man long oration wound saying : “ Perhaps I fatigued speaking long , ” Castruccio said : “ You , I listened word said. ” He used say one beautiful child afterwards became fine man , dangerous , first took husbands wives took wives husbands . To envious man laughed , said : “ Do laugh successful another unfortunate ? ” Whilst still charge Messer Francesco Guinigi , one companions said : “ What shall I give let give blow nose ? ” Castruccio answered : “ A helmet. ” Having put death citizen Lucca instrumental raising power , told done wrong kill one old friends , answered people deceived ; killed new enemy . Castruccio praised greatly men intended take wife , saying like men said would go sea , refused time came .
