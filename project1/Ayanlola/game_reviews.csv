"Teen, 17 years old",age 7+,Kids dont listent to the parents saying ''ThIs GaMe HaS sWoRdS tHaT mEaNs ThErE iS vIoLaNcE'' there is no violance but its good to not play all day play like idk 2 hours.I think minecraft is a child friendly game and is open to all ages thats my opinion.
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,I have been playing this game for many years and I have never gotten scared or had nightmares about the monsters and “violence”. There is no blood or anything very gruesome. All you do is hit the animal/monster. From Minecraft I learned how to build great houses (not that great :( ) and it allows me and my brother to be creative and build.
"Kid, 12 years old",age 7+,The game is great with no true inappropriate things
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,Are you sure you got common sense. I would give this game 3 MILLION stars! 7 dollars isn't a lot of money!
"Kid, 10 years old",age 5+,IDK WHAT TO SAY BUT DIS IS DA BEST GAME EVA
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,"This game is awesome with creativity, a way to build your own army of wolves and monsters to hunt, it is awesome and there is no blood so no violence and it allows you to express yourself with TNT. whats not to love. This game also has PG violence and U violence at the same time, you can venture into hell or just build structures, it is your choice."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,"GREAT game. Educational, but on some servers parents should turn off chat because some people post bad words and things like ""do you want to have sex""
YES, THESE SERVERS DO USE FILTERS ON CHAT, BUT SOME PEOPLE MOVE AROUND THESE RULES. But overall, mine craft is awesome!"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 8+,That Minecraft is the best educational and creative game ever!
"Teen, 13 years old",age 8+,It has added lots of PC features. But I still can't find a village! You can have dogs that teleport to you and spawn monsters in creative mode!! #1
"Kid, 9 years old",age 17+,Build a world and whatever you want.
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,
"Kid, 9 years old",age 5+,"I think this is a very good game. I have been playing it for about 3 years now and never had a nightmare of a bad dream. I think this game has no potential ""violence"" or ""scarynes"". I think this is a good game for building destroying and creativity"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 4+,This game is definitely worth the buy. It helps people exercise creativity and has so many possibilities.
"Teen, 17 years old",age 4+,"It is such a fun game, and it is perfect for children all ages!"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 5+,Great for all ages
"Teen, 17 years old",age 13+,My brother plays this game I seen him do some sketchy stuff on it he used TNT to explode a huge building
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,"This is a game that is all about being creative but still not wasting resources. In survival mode you can survive and create stuff, in creative mode you can build whatever you want. There is endless creativity with endless parameters. It is a fairly complex game so I would recommend it for ages 6 and up, but all in all its pretty simple, and has the goals of exploration and creativity. A must have educational game with endless lands, very little violence (You only kill animals, monsters, ect. to survive), and infinite possibilities."
"Teen, 15 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft PE is a great building/survival game with minimal violence. You can play one of two game modes: Creative and Survival. In creative mode you can not die and build anything you want from an unlimited supply of blocks. Neat-o. Nothing mature here. Then there's survival mode. In this mode you must collect recourses to build your shelter and must survive monsters in the night. The monsters are more comical due to their blocky textures and include pretty bizarre characters (you have your usual skeletons, zombies, and spiders but also have unique character such as creepers [creatures that blow themselves up] and endermen [a tall monster that can teleport around the map]). You can kill these creatures with swords/bow and arrows, but there is no blood (they only jump back from hits) and disappear instantly when they become deceased. If you play in the multiplayer mode, you can kill human characters, but they have the same mild death animation. I would allow a four year old to play creative mode, but I would recommend survival mode only for kids aged six and up due to some mild violence."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,"I love this game. It is fun to build things and mine. For kids 7 and under, I recommend only creative mode, but 8 and up should be allowed to do survival. If you let your younger child do survival, I recommend putting the setting on ""Peaceful Mode"" (no monsters at night.)"
"Teen, 17 years old",age 18+,Good
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,"best game ever, no blood, the ""violence and zombies"" are not realistic at all, teaches you some stuff about real life and fantasy at the same time, creative mode just builds creativity, mojang's biggest masterpiece ever!"
"Kid, 9 years old",age 2+,But laggy
"Kid, 12 years old",age 8+,"Parents say it has killing and is violent, but not really. You can play in creative mode, which is meant to easily build things. Or, you can play on survival, where you survive. You kill animals for food, but it is not violent."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 5+,Minecraft is a great game that is easy to play but very fun. The is nothing bad about the game but the is a tiny bit of violence in it but nothing to be concerned about.
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,I think that Minecraft PE is a little harder than PC because the controls are harder to use. I recommend PE for younger kids because its better for them to play on.
"Kid, 11 years old",age 9+,"Minecraft is an amazing game, allowing you to create amazing things, if I could, I would give this app 3 Quintilian stars. I don't know what Karen decided that if it has swords, it's violent, I've never had a single nightmare about Minecraft, and I've been playing for years."
"Kid, 8 years old",age 8+,"Minecraft is an epic game about building, crafting, mining THE BEST EVER"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 3+,I Know a 3 year old who loves this game 8+ are you serious???
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,It encourages creativity.
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,"BudderPug's Review:
I grew up playing this game with my sibling, and we both loved it!
We would always get so excited when an update would come out. (Each update makes the game more advanced)
This is an amazing sandbox style game to get creative with, I recommend it highly."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,Never played it? Give it a shot even adults love this classic!
"Kid, 11 years old",age 3+,"I think this app is appropriate for ages 3 and up, because it seems like a nice game to play and you can turn off the monsters from coming with the difficulty select. Overall, great app."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,I love Minecraft! Awesome!
"Teen, 13 years old",age 9+,"So I am also concerned about privacy in Minecraft, but overall, I LOVE IT! But there is the Enderman, who freaks kids out with one loud static sound. But then, here's the part that doesn't add up: The game introduces childer to RAIDS. Yes, you heard me right, LITERAL, WHOPPING, REAL RAIDS. Thanks to that introduction of the terror-inducing raids, we get spawn eggs: Vindicator, Vex, Ravager, Evoker, and Pillager. Here are some things that are harmful to kids to be introduced to raids with these spawn egg characters.
1. The Ravager looks somewhat similar to a war elephant a Pillager, Evoker, or Vindicator can mount on.
2. The evoker during actual raids, can summon up these crocodile-looking fangs, called 'fangs'. This is not real to summon an attack spell in real-life raids.
3. The Vindicators and Pillagers have axes and crossbows. This introduces kids to harmful raid weapons.
4. The Vex are depicted as cute, ghostly-looking faires with a sword in their hands. Then, they turn creepy, and evil when they attack which may scare children. Like when the Evoker does a magic attack spell, this doesn't happen in real-life-threatening raids.
And thus this concludes the list and the review.
And on a positive note; I love Minecraft as much as I do when I want to play it!"
"Teen, 17 years old",age 2+,"you can kill pregnant people! You can shoot everyone! :D Only let 2+ play this game. You can get addicted to this satanic evil, hypnotic, ghost, shitty game. Play it with your grandad, sister, papa, dream, idc who it is.
Watch 5 year olds die, watch dead bodies rot! minecraft! the best game for kids under 5! So, uh, ah.. Ah yes! there are hot npcs like creepers, hot boys and girls..
so online date with the new minecraft! careful, it's expensive! There's some naked people, but there's also some math like 89+02+ pi so.. yeah, there's a math board next to one of the trees with a hot maid next to it, free feel to play! :D"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,"This game is great, and y’all 9 quintillion year old boomers need to shut your pie holes for godred’s sake! But it minecraft does has lots of consumerism."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,"Ahhh here we are again, ""My six Year Old sun is going to the nether thats bad"" Well guys really set limits on children's play, tell them to not do things you dont want, dont chat with strangers. Done good bye"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 7+,"the game wasn't intended for violence, the game is only for fun, and don't think there'll be blood because the only thing is the characters flash red and make noises, and it isn't that scary"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 4+,creepy enderman
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,"MINECRAFT IS GREAT!!! But parents are worrying too much. They think killing animals is wrong but it's just the game. I bet our ancestors killed animals right? So kids dont worry one bit about the game!! I love it and I started playing it around 6-7 years old!! Try out the game but if you dont like it, it's just your opinion!!"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,"okay, first of all, this is the pocket edition of the game.
bruh.
And why do you keep rating good things only 4 stars?
anyway, pocket edition isn't AS good as the normal game, the layout is kinda weird.
But its good for people that arent scared of pixelated zombies. :D"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 8+,"The parents are saying that it is gory and violent. Let me explain.
Firstly, it may get a little unsettling on the first night, when monsters appear, if children do not like the monsters, they can turn it on peaceful mode.
I heard a lot about animal abuse. You are allowed to hit anything in the game, and people kill animals for food in real life, so that really isn't that bad.
There isn't any blood or gore, prior to what Karens have said about fighting the monsters or attacking animals. The ""mobs"" (creatures) will turn a shade of red when attacked, but this is just to signal them being hurt, and it isn't blood.
A mode called ""Creative"" lets you play and fly, and you can't get injured. You have infinite resources. This mode has inspired me so much with some of my houses that I want to be an architect when I'm an adult!
I recommend this game for any tactical or creative child.
*P.S. You can play online in ""Realms"", but the chatboxes are strictly moderated and safe, you can hide said chat, or play offline"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 5+,I see all these parents ranting about how online people are creating inappropriate things and there like “blah blah blah why can’t they just block” that’s hard to do it’s not like they can just press a button and shlabam now everything is censored also I saw a post about a vegan family and the kid ate meat in the game in front of his dad and the dad slapped the controller out of his hand if the kid doesn’t want to be vegan he doesn’t have to be
"Kid, 9 years old",age 5+,great game for kids when in the car
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,"Not very much to say but, players can fight kill animals and combat mobs. You can play with people on your wifi. Some kids may be discouraged by how less things you can do than the pc version."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,"It's the best game ever!
The most popular game at school!
You learn to build and survive zombis and spiders and more!
You can play with friends and anyone that has minecraft
Have fun playing
MINECRAFT
The best game in the universe"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 8+,"i love minecraft pocket eddition it is a good game to pass the time away i have a lot of free time since the summer time started and so i play it all the time!
I LOVE MINECRAFT!"
"Kid, 9 years old",age 3+,u should get the pc verison its better gamerquinn is out
"Kid, 11 years old",age 9+,its ok but the pc version us better but it cost 27 dollars the ios version is much cheaper its 7 dollars its ok but yeah pc version is better.
"Kid, 10 years old",age 9+,its awesome im 10 and i love it
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,Great for a kid that wants to get into the minecraft games but it is pricey $6.99 + tax
"Kid, 12 years old",age 5+,"It’s a pretty good game that is pretty fun, but gets boring easily. I constantly get bored when playing in survival which they mean to do, because Minecraft is overall a Pay to Win(Or at least to have fun) Game"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 4+,"You should let your child play this game in creative mode, so then they can develop an early understanding of design, geometry, and architecture. Even adults can use this to make drafts of new houses, if their occupation is architecturally related!"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,MINECRAFT IS BETTER THAN REAL LIFE
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,"i don't really think it's as bad as most say. animals are OK. zombies that come out at night . normal game stuff. mods can be scary tho. but some times it's educational. but there is a breeding aspect, but its not actual uh s** (child safety i don't use that term.) no real issues other than that."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 5+,The game is so fun! You can play it al day! You can play survival or creative! My favorite is survival! I can build anything I want in the game! :D I think it's appropriate for kids 5 and up!
"Kid, 11 years old",age 7+,Minecraft is one of the best games out there. I use it to play with my cousins who live in another state.
"Teen, 14 years old",age 8+,"I would deffo recommend this to little kids as it can educate them on good building and social skills, I got it when I was 7 and still play it till this day, at 14."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 10+,"Minecraft is a good game! It's really easy to play, you can do whatever with blocks. You can play with other people online, which is fun. It's worth playing!"
"Kid, 9 years old",age 2+,"I said ages 2 an up bc, i mean literally anyone can play! And just bc it has swords and bows doesnt mean it it violent. And if you are a parent worried about chat, if your kid goes into a server it is not like you see the chat you have to go to chat to see the stuff"
"Teen, 17 years old",age 10+,"I watched Jacksepticeyes series on him playing Minecraft (just a heads up parents, he curses a lot) and I got curious and wanted to play the game. So I got on it and started finding ideas for houses, buildings, pools, and other cool stuff. It’s really fun and it’s also fun to play when you’re bored."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 9+,"Minecraft is an amazing game, it's a sandbox game and can be used to unleash kids creativity. I recommend this for kids 9+ due to the game allowing the killing of animals and other players (no blood or gore included.) There are also servers you can play on and they involve public activity with others. Overall, it's a great game for creativity, survival and socialising!"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 18+,
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,"I've been playing since i was pretty young, and there's not too much violence in it so i think its a great starter game"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 5+,"-Tiny bit of violence but no gore at all.
-You can die.
-Very fun!"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 5+,"This game is actually really good. You can learn about survival and build and explore the endless world of Minecraft but watch out, there may be monsters lurking around the deep dark caves so get your fighting skills ready!"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 5+,"minecraft is a fun game. It helps build the creativity of people more than any other sandbox game I know . some violence is in the game but most games contain that and no blood or gore is present. the only sign of attacking is the basic red tint that covers all of the creature attacked. pets are also present in the game and can help those who struggle with building in total due to the tons of items that they can choose to build with. you can also name pets so you can have the feel of actually owning the pet. some special names that affect the animal appearance is Jeb_ for sheep Toast for rabbits, and dinner bone for absolutely any animal in the game. I highly recommend this game."
"Teen, 14 years old",age 10+,"Awesome game, but there is griefing, cyberbullying, online play, and kids can build what ever they want. Which should not be for kids younger than 10. But if you're fine with letting your kids play, not my business, it's not like I have been playing since I was 4."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,Good
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,"I LOVE MINECRAFT IT IS SO FUN AND ADDICTING AND I WISH I COULD JUMP IN THE GAME AND PLAY IT ON MY OWN WITHOUT MY CONTROLLER ON.
MINECRAFT IS SO MUCH FUN AND FORTNITE IS ASS
EVERYONE SHOULD DOWNLOAD MINECRAFT IT HAS A BUNCH OF FUN STUFF AND IT WILL CURE YOUR BOREDOM you should buy it."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,"omg swords its so scary. No! omg killing animals terrifying and anti-vegan. Wow. Even my parents were misinformed about Minecraft at the start. My dad had it (and still does!) on his PC, and he got it for us on the ipad. It's a fun game, and servers aren't bad because you never see anyone talk about porn or anything. It's a good game, a fun game, and, parents, if you haven't noticed, the majority of players are kids. And don't give me 'different homes have different rules'. No. That's stupid. And if you're so worried, disable their ability to use servers. Or give them Java Edition, which is waaaaaaay easier to use and you can use a child Microsoft account."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 4+,Always let kid play this game. It has an educational mode to educate them. It is fun but not too addictive
"Kid, 10 years old",age 4+,"yes chat is not rated, yes there is killing, yes creepers are making me mad after they explode my diamonds, but its amazing and FUN"
"Kid, 8 years old",age 8+,"All of the game works nice and good,But it can get really laggy sometimes"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 8+,"This game is honestly one of the best, however there are a few drawbacks. First thing Minecraft is an amazing game all the time and it’s very enjoyable with friends there’s no limit to how many people can play in one server there are communities who build servers it is really fun to play. It’s available on 90% of devices Xbox computer Nintendo switch PlayStation Amazon tablets and more. The only thing I see has a problem is that there’s no tagging, usually Minecraft does not target when someone says a bad word there is a problem for younger players if you go into a high pixel game (A very large server with mini games) people will often chat with others, you can say whatever because there’s no tags. The game is honestly really fun and playing it as I’m writing the review there are lots of Minecraft Youtubers who will help your child build things, Minecraft is also really educational to craft Child needs to put certain things together to make things like swords and pickaxes which brings me to my next topic, My craft has a little bit of islands here and there but never overwhelmingly violent you have to protect yourself from monsters are they scary not at all your child should be fine play Minecraft as long as there are a few restrictions otherwise they will be fine"
"Teen, 17 years old",age 8+,"i hate this game my boyfriend and i always have mental breakdowns right after. no this is not a personal issue i literally despise this game mojang lock your doors, hide your children, keep an eye out for selener."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,"Encouraging creativity so much! This game has lived part of my childhood and it's DEFINITELY WORTH THE PURCHASE!! It may get boring for some, or be hard for newbies, but once you get into it it's great! It's a survival game with some fiction, such as the nether realm and the ender realm, and, zombies and monsters at night, but overall it's really nice. 10/10 Would recommend :)
Oh, also, there's creative mode where you can build anything without dying."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 8+,"It's an amazing game, some parents/adults might say there is violence or that being online is too dangerous, in reality no. There is a little concern for kids that are young that play this, and yes there are not a lot of privacy concerns, but if a young child is playing multiplayer with strangers then you don't have worry about them or even monitor them much, but I do think it would be a good thing to educate your child about the dangers of the strangers since there is not a filter for chat. So it is easy to play and has little privacy concerns, 8/10 from personal experience but still pretty nice game definitely recommended it."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,Anyone thinks to bye with that much money it worth it
"Teen, 14 years old",age 3+,"Me and my younger sister have played minecraft (MC) since she was 4 when update aquatic had first came out (we play it on our xbox) It's easy to learn the basics of the game at first and you get better with practice there are servers and multiplayer games to socialize in if your child is younger you can change settings to sensor out words you don't want them reading there are tons of maps, characters, and texture packs in the marketplace and some are free if you don't understand something about the game its very popular and there are tons of videos to help!"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft is a really fun game that is appropriate for anybody to play. There is violence in it, but that is the only thing in it. There is no blood or anything else inappropriate. It is definitely worth buying, because of all the free content available to play on the game. I would recommend using this on a computer, as it gives you access to more stuff for free, but the free stuff on computers can be prone to viruses, escpecially when downloaded from another site."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,"i started watching like stampy and dantdm when i was like 3 or 5 and then i actually got minecraft when i was like 5 or 6 on my tablet. It has like zombies and like skeletons and spiders and stuff and u can die in it but its nothing scary like okay maybe i get scared of the cave noises sometimes.. but thats it. I may scream alot cause somethings trying to uh kill me but THATS JUST ME- you can also play in creative which nothing can attack you and you can build with anything you'd like, theres also survival where you get matierls like wood, stone, iron, etc (which you can still get in creative) but you dont have unlimited blocks and things can attack you. You can also play with friends and i guess thats sorta cool. You can download addons which are like mods but for bedrock edition too so yeah. Theres many versions, theres bedrock, java, pocket edition ( this version ), console ( xbox, play station, nintendo switch, etc. )"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 3+,"This game is AMAZING. It teaches kids to be creative at a young age. Would I recommend single player? Yes. The online community has it’s pros and cons depending on which server you choose. A Christian family-friendly server? Yep. But there are bad ones as well. Great game would recommend single player to ANYONE. Online, well, be careful. 10/10"
"Kid, 9 years old",age 9+,"no blood here, all i can tell just the thing that got hit turns red for a second. well, there still might not be too much of a chat filter as it can still allow some mild profanity like WHAT THE HELL or crap. but swears are filtered so its ok for some older children"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 5+,The best game
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,It is very good and encourages creativity. I don't think there is violence . Killing animals to get food or fending of predators is a part of the game. Your kids will have to learn where meat comes from at some point.
"Teen, 13 years old",age 13+,Sallinas
"Teen, 17 years old",age 5+,this game is fun but its really glitchy on a fire kindle its pretty sad
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,"This is a good game. Java cost money, so I asked to get it for my b-day. The only violence in this is killing animals for food ( you do this in real life so not that bad), and defending yourself from mobs(zombies,skelitions etc). You can make a house and live a life in this game. Fun for all ages"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 7+,"It's a good game teaching Kids to be creative especially on creative mode. I see why some people call it scary- I admit I've been playing since I was seven and was a bit scared of the spiders and zombies but you can just put it on peaceful. If you don't like the idea of your kids playing with other people, just turn it of in the settings. That isn't hard. It's better then them playing on Roblox. But there's nothing in the game that a normal 7 year old wouldn't be able to handle."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,This game encourages creativity and its'a good game for ages 6 and up.
"Teen, 17 years old",age 4+,"I love Minecraft it is so fun building houses,cooking food,make food,and making friend have fun and play!!"
"Kid, 9 years old",age 8+,"I play this game and I like it a lot, it can be violent though. So basically, if your kid is playing this game in survival then they will have to kill animals to survive, there’s also zombies, creepers, and skeletons that you have to kill because they are basically evil. If you don’t want your kid killing animals then you can turn off mob spawning. (Mobs include pigs, sheep, cows, chickens, etc.) There are also public servers which signed in people can log into, so if you don’t want your kids/kid talking to people then you don’t have to sign in. Also if your signed in you can friend people, but you can only friend them if you’re in a server or you know their username. So if you want it to be on the safe side, put it into peaceful mode with mob spawning off. I personally think there’s nothing wrong with the game, and you shouldn’t worry. But there is also an in-game currency called minecoins that you can use to buy maps, mods (modifications), and texture packs. In the game there are also various ways for you to die, like falling lava, drowning, dying of hunger, etc, etc. And in the game if your in a server you can chat with people."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,"It is a fun game. A lot of people say that it gives you no tutorial or objective. That’s because there really isn’t one. There is a final boss called the Ender dragon, and a lot of people finish the game by defeating it, but you can still build crazy structures and go on epic adventures. I would still like to see some more abilities on lesser known versions, like Pocket Edition or Bedrock."
"Teen, 16 years old",age 16+,
"Kid, 9 years old",age 6+,"this is a kids game as you can see. Some parents think this is bad but its not!
1: don't have blood
2: dosn't have guns and i don't know why you wouldn't want your kids to play something withs guns................WHAT ABOUT NERF GUNS HUH
3: its really fun and minecraft education is were you can ALSO LEARN SOMETHING SO HOW ABOUT DAT HUH
ok u can get guns and blood in mods but why would you want a blood mod??
its fun and i think more people should play it"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 5+,its a really good game but a little violent but still its good. THere is creative mode which you can build lots of fun stuff. But survival is a bit violent. amazing tho
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,"I don't play this game at all, but my younger brother plays, and we live under the same roof, so it is kinda hard NOT to know almost everything about it. If you ask me, this game is some what fun and addictive. When my brother first saw the game thumbnail, he begged our parents to buy it for him. When they did, he would always play it. And I said addictive because he would cry if my parents started saying things like, ""you can't play until you do your chores!"" or, ""you can't play until summer!"". But of course, my brother is a nice kid, so he got over it after a few days. BUT STILL, it's a bit of a weird game to me, I don't really understand the concept or anything, but everyone has their own opinions. I also think that if you decide to let your child play, you should still moderate them (mostly if they have online i guess). Overall, the game is appropriate and I would say it's not much to worry about, but still needs some parent supervision."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 3+,"This is a great game with many cool updates and more! It’s available on PC, XBOX, Playstation, iPhone, and more! Highly recommend!"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 7+,"I'm not allowed to play any other games than Minecraft, and I love it! I'm also not allowed to play multiplayer.
Here are my tips for a good Minecraft experience:
1) Begin with peaceful and creative mode, then go to easy and creative, then normal and creative, then hard and creative and so on until you get to survival. That helps you get adjusted to the game.
2) If you don't want any multiplayer, then don't create an account.
3) If you're in survival mode, first thing you should do is to craft a wooden sword and bed. You can then dig underground to create your own home."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 6+,Minecraft is a very fun game for children that also encourages creativity and strategy. In creative you can improve your creativity and build things with almost no limits from amazing structures to complex machinery and in survival you understand basic survival skills more and have to work on your strategy to win. I don't think kids under 6 should play survival though because of the monsters unless volume is off and you're on peaceful or easy mode. Overall really fun game that's definitely worth it to get.
"Kid, 11 years old",age 4+,"trust a review from a kid. A kid that actually played minecraft. Not an adult that barely knows anything about the game but saw their child killing a zombie. Minecraft is a free roam sandbox game about surviving, exploring, fighting and creating. there is mild violence against some blocky zombies and skeletons (not scary at all). creative mode is different to survival since the main focus is building. you can play with your friends in your LAN (local area network) or join a server for which you will require a microsoft account. There is an open chat in servers but it censores out swear words."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,You can also play this game without any monsters or other potentially scary stuff.
"Teen, 15 years old",age 2+,"This game is one of the least violent games I've ever seen. I started playing this game in 2010, so when I was 4 and I loved it. Some people are concerned about killing animals for fun and stuff like that but I did that when I first got it because in a weird way it was satisfying. So if your kids do that then they aren't psychopaths they just find it satisfying. If you think this game is for 10+ then I don't think you realize how violent games can get."
"Teen, 16 years old",age 10+,this game is the best on the computer but it is still very great on all platforms
"Teen, 16 years old",age 2+,"The ESRB sucks, this is not 10.....
any 2 year old can play minecraft, don't blindly follow the ESRB"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 3+,This game was my childhood. This game brings people together to communicate and progress. Children can play together with their friends and there is a lot to happen keeping them engaged in the game. In conclusion this game is great to play with friends and great for kids.
"Teen, 13 years old",age 9+,"In survival mode, you can find monsters, and too survive, you have to either run away, or fight them. To fight them, you can fight with your fists, or make weapons (swords, bow and arrow, ect...). when you finally attack them they turn red (maybe its blood). I don't think fighting would be in a game for younger kids"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft is a block game. It's easy to play and learn, there's no language unless your playing multiplayer and that can easily be turned off in the settings. There is little violence, as enemies and creatures disappear into smoke."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 10+,"Minecraft is one of the best games in my opinion. You can build, survive, play online, and do many other things!! And for the parents who say that this is a bad game, I highly disagree with you. There is NO blood or anything else."
"Kid, 7 years old",age 6+,anyone under 6 will prolly have nightmares (idk) but if its wrong tell da parents my review is wrong. lol
"Kid, 9 years old",age 8+,i don't think kids under 8 get the point of the game they don't get how amazing common sense media say you don't have instructions on your goals but you have achievements but the'r right thats all.
"Kid, 11 years old",age 3+,"Minecraft is a cool voxel based game for many kids and adults. There are pretty much endless possibilities for Minecraft, from building a regular house, to making a big computer program, all with the help of mechanical items. I recommend this game for toddlers, but there are some stuff that some of them might not understand. First is multiplayer. You can have many people in one session in your world. Be careful- there are many toxic people and cyber bullies who could say swears in the chat. To fix this, Bedrock edition should be played, where many swears are blocked. Another problem is real world monetization. Many servers/rooms offer in game items that are overpowered for real currency. To fix this, you should let your kid stick with single player worlds, until they are at least 5-6, where they should understand money and ways to use it. Overall, this game is kid friendly and for all ages."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,"ok i am a noob ngl but it is fun even though i play pocket and x-box 360
but i want people who have never played it to play"
"Teen, 17 years old",age 2+,"Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang. The game was created by Markus ""Notch"" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early test versions, it was released as a paid public alpha for personal computers in 2009 before releasing in November 2011, with Jens Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with 200 million copies sold and 126 million monthly active users as of 2020.
In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled ""mobs"", as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.
Minecraft has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual MineCon conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Dungeons, and Minecraft Earth.In survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items.Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character, requiring players to build a shelter at night. The mode also has a health bar which is depleted by attacks from mobs, falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events.[citation needed] Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game, except in peaceful difficulty.[citation needed] If the hunger bar is depleted, automatic healing will stop and eventually health will deplete. Health replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful difficulty."
"Teen, 17 years old",age 8+,There's just some minor issues. One issue is that it isn't very popular. I say buy java instead. It has better servers to me. Sure bedrock has lifeboat and hive. But Java has Highpixel. The other issue is that its kinda hard to use during combat. I wish it was more like java and there was this cross in the middle. And if you tap the screen it just hits/mines whatever is at that area. Other than that. Its just great. But it can be buggy at times.
"Teen, 16 years old",age 2+,Come on zombies are scary to much violence ur you kidding. I would give this 1000000000000000000000000000000000 stars if i could my sister started playing this at 4 years old. the legit only thing the be scared of are the cave sounds. that is a hurtful stereotype.
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,minecraft good fortnite bad lmao
"Kid, 8 years old",age 3+,i know you think its for 13+ but its actually gots to be 3+ so the learn it best and then they can play it at an older age
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft is a great game, but if you don't want your kid playing with strangers, then they can play by themselves.
Sure, you might kill animals, but deal with it. That is how the world works. You an go on creative mode, which is mostly for building and stuff."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 10+,"this is such a good game, younger kids should play on creative mode but kids 11-69 years old should play bedwars on hypixel or sky kingdoms.
I am so good at it and i can god bridge and get like 10000000 cps and fling children into the void so i can win all the games. i am a 69420 star in hypixel and its super fun and i never lose
WARNING: IF U SUCK AT THE GAME DONT PLAY CUZ U CAN RAGE EASILY*"
"Teen, 17 years old",age 18+,hi it pamela
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,"I play Minecraft every freaking day. This. Game. Is. THE BEST. EVER. There is so much exploring, and it's not like other video games--it's endless. You don't ""win"" it, you play. There are different game modes: creative, you can fly, get an endless inventory, never die, can breathe underwater, mobs don't hurt you. Adventure, you can't break any block and can't place--you explore. Survival, my personal favorite. You can get hungry, you can die, you can drown--I know that may sound depressing, but sometimes it's not fun in creative mode, without any limits entirely.
Not only kids play Minecraft, adults do too. Youtubers, for example: Eystreem, LazarBeam, Dream, ect."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft is a timeless classic. Placing the player in a randomly generated world, Minecraft forces them to, well, mine and craft to survive. However, it can become repetitive, which is why I rated it 4 stars rather than 5. It is still worth the low price on Mobile devices. The Windows 10 edition is rather pricey though. Although it is generally kid-safe, there are some things that parents may be concerned about. For example, when playing in multiplayer servers, some users may use foul language or discuss innapropriate topics. Some character designs could be slightly scary to younger children who have not been exposed to similar things before."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft is a fun sandbox game that encourages children to build. As long as your children play on single player worlds, or world that require an IP to join, your child will be fine. Beware of hackers and don't join to many public servers. There can be toxic people out there."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 18+,creeper aw man
"Kid, 10 years old",age 8+,"Minecraft is a good and Family-Friendly game there is a tad of violence but it's on fake characters and there is no guns it's a really good game but, to access online features you have to have or create a Microsoft Account"
"Teen, 16 years old",age 4+,"Its really good! And if any some angry parents complain, dont listen to them at all. They just think its too ""violent"" When its not THAT violent! All there is some killing with swords bows and blah blah. Thats not too violent! And in creative With imagination You can build anything you want! So i really recommend it!"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,"It's suitable for any age really, just that kids under 5 probably won't understand it and will have trouble playing. It's a great game that anyone can play and is so fun."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 5+,"This game is super fun however after a while it does get a bit boring which is why I don't suggest playing this all the time. It's the most fun with friends and when there's a new update even though new updates are pretty rare, they are full with amazing new features which makes them worthwhile. The combat in this game is not bad at all and you don't even need to fight if you don’t want to which is why I gives this 6 plus."
"Teen, 15 years old",age 6+,"Its a good game due to the amount of creativity, and all the adults that don't like the killing...THIS IS A SURVIVAL GAME! You gotta get the protean"
"Teen, 16 years old",age 6+,I saw a parent say that my son joined a sever and some say that there are pepole saying bad words minecraft blocks bad words the only thing bad is dont let your kids download bad mods this. Game is very child friendly
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,"Ive been playing for 8 years (since i was 5) it is a wonderful game and you shouldnt give two shits about animal death in a video game when you karen eat dead animals all the fucking TIME dont act like you dont eat steak, its a fact of life deal with it."
"Teen, 17 years old",age 3+,
"Teen, 15 years old",age 10+,"My friend Minecraft Alex told me to hate this game. I kinda do, but at the same time, not really. Sure, the wolves and bees with their demonic red eyes could be scary for younger kids(and myself), but it's pretty good."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 5+,"minecraft was the first ever game i had and it is very fun you can mine,build,farm ect there is nothing bad im just nit sure if kids 4- would like understand how to pkay? But kids 5+ its great i started playing minecraft when i was 5, and im still playing it now that im 12"
"Teen, 15 years old",age 5+,"Minecraft is an amazing game and I would recommend it to anyone. The game generally appropriate for all as long as you only join good servers. Although it costs money, it is a one time purchase you will never regret. The game does contain violence, however you can choose whether or not you play on creative or survival, so it is easy to avoid and the violence is very subtle (hunting animals for food, killing monsters) and there is never any blood.
Overall, I would recommend Minecraft to anyone."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 7+,"Those one star reviews are by 1-dimensional hover parents who don't care about their happiness and only care about their safety. Despite some ""violence"" like weapons, death and PvP, which you'll find in almost any game, this is a really great game for all ages, and has an amazing and huge community, but don't play it for too long at a time!"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 3+,There are adults that are saying “ oH YOu cAn KIlL chicKenS dOnT plAAy but in the real world people kill chickens and they dont say oh you killed a chicken you cannot live anymore
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft is a fairly family friendly game, but there are some elements that children under 6 shouldn't play with, such as killing animals. If your child is under 6 don't let them play it.
There are 'minecoins' which are like robux in roblox. Make sure that your child doesn't spend all your money on minecoins."
"Kid, 8 years old",age 2+,"Honestly, IDK why these parents are like ""THERE'S WEAPONS SO IT'S TOO VIOLENT"" literally, that's the point of the game, getting food, building, mining, and yeah, it's endless. Anyways it's not violent, there's no blood and it's not gruesome, so don't worry! It's perfectly fine."
"Teen, 17 years old",age 2+,it is really good although you could install mods that make it 18+
"Kid, 9 years old",age 6+,Great Game for Children
"Teen, 16 years old",age 8+,"Minecraft is a great game but when it comes to getting the game or logging into an account it's the worst. I have played and loved Minecraft for years, but I have always found problems with trying to log in. Today I wanted to play Minecraft I own an account, but it almost seems that my account was deleted, I can't seem to log in and every time I try and reset my password it never sends to my email, when I tried make a new account it would say that my email was already being used in an account but when I would try to log in it would say that my email is not registered in my account. overall, it's a great game but I really wish I didn't have to find ways to work around the dumb shit that keeps happening to my accounts."

"Kid, 12 years old",age 5+,Noice
"Kid, 12 years old",age 6+,It’s good nothing is bad. Non-Pocket edition is better. Literally nothing inappropriate except for when you play on a public server and someone curses. Doesnt really happen though. How the game is structured makes it hard to be inappropriate.
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,"Lots of creativity involved, and not as violent as fortnite besides a few monsters. There are people, interactions, building, and quests, which is awesome. The scariest thing is an Enderman, but they're rare and don't hurt you unless you stare at them, get too close, or hurt them; people above 8 are mostly the ones going after them, as you need to in order to win the game. The other scariest things are called Ghasts, which are creepy octopus-ghost things roaming a hellish place called The Nether, but no 7 year-old knows how to get there or wants to go there. Exactly like Little House On The Prairie, except for pixel."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,"Really good game, it has a lot of items and the updates are cool!! Its not that scary for children either what a good game!!."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 14+,There is hitting and sword use and zombies that can scare you my brother started at 6 and had nightmares because of it for a month and could not gat to sleep and this happens to his friends to
"Kid, 12 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft is very fun. And it has a few problems such as people being inapropraite but thats the people not the game. Minecraft overall is easy to play.
Survival mode is good for people who understand the game and want a challenge while Creative mode is for people who just want fun or don't know how to play very well."
"Teen, 17 years old",age 2+,"I am sick and tired of people who write reviews for this game telling people that it is a waste of money. Honestly, Minecraft is the greatest game that will ever exist."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 4+,hello im absolutely obsessed whith this game its my go to swich game hope it yours to or u r b a d .
"Teen, 14 years old",age 8+,"Minecraft is the game where you can build anything and be as creative as you want. You can also play on Minecraft servers that have games. I play on hypixel.net, and Bedwars. Like I said, you can do ANYTHING in Minecraft, as lost as you want to!"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 7+,
"Kid, 10 years old",age 4+,Encourages creativity and makes you think.
"Teen, 14 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft is arguably one of the best. It can teach kids the fundamentals of programming skills, teamwork, problem-solving, project management, and offers a fantastic environment to foster creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. Minecraft is educational because it enhances creativity, problem-solving, self-direction, collaboration, and other life skills. ... Importantly, Minecraft also teaches business principles, STEM knowledge, and a global perspective. Both fun and educational, Minecraft is easily on our list of best video games for kids."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,"This is a great game 7+ because that’s when I think they will understand the game also it’s when they can handle more animated violence this game includes killing animals, and other players, there is also online with a chat so if you don’t want your kids in a chat I wouldn’t recommend giving it to your kids"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 12+,
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,"No blood or guts, no creepy stalkers, easy and fun gameplay, it’s a great game! There is the tiniest bit of violence (whacking a zombie with a sword is pretty much the worst of it) there’s also no guns, so that really narrows down the violent content. I can see a younger child getting quite frustrated at the game, you can get killed, or drown or suffocate, and if you’re in survival you pretty much have to start all over again, but overall I really do love this game and I think it’s a great way for friends, family and siblings especially to bond and have fun together. This game was released ages ago but it’s still popular today, which proves it’s a good game. It’s also a great way to allow kids to be creative and build things or farm animals or just complete the game by surviving. However the dark caves and zombie sound effects might scare younger audiences (they used to scare me!) but honestly you could really just slap your 2 year old in front of the computer with minecraft and it’s unlikely an issue would arise."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,"I've been playing Minecraft for about 8 years now and I have never got bored of it ever! There is no drug use or extreme violence at all and is great for all ages (I recommend you play Minecraft if you are 7 years or above), especially for kids as it increases working memory, problem-solving skills, social skills and creativity. Overall, I highly recommend you play Minecraft and I guarantee that you will enjoy it"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 3+,"Minecraft is a fun game I think for any age. Minecraft is a game where you can create and basically do whatever you want. Now about the violence it really isn't much because when a player hits a mob (mob meaning creature) or when a player hits another player when you kill a mob it will disappear in smoke and when you kill a person they will just fall to the floor (not dramaticaly) and will disappear. One thing that is good to know is that if your kid plays online on server your kid can literally hear any type of thing sometimes since minecraft has a safe-chat thingy but people can still find ways to put it in. The last thing is that consumerism is very high in the marketplace (which is in the minecraft main menu) where you can buy maps, skins (meaning a players avatar), and texture packs/behavior packs (these are additions to the game to make it more fun)."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 8+,"Everyone thinks that minecraft is the best game ever but i think that it is very overrated, and plus most of the people that say it is the best probably barely play it."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 10+,it has never let me down i play minecraft a lot and all i think is that it needs more updates
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,not that violent
"Kid, 11 years old",age 8+,"This is a bit outdated. It's no longer just pocket edition, it's bedrock edition and it's on nearly all platforms. It is very easy to play, once you get the hang of the controls it's easy to play. It is a building game, but there's a lot more. There's very little violence, and there is an education edition used by schools. If you're under 8, the controls may be a bit hard to use. In my opinion, this is better than the ""pc version"", which is now java edition."
"Teen, 17 years old",age 10+,"Minecraft is kinda boring: My main problem is the way u get resources, is the same way at the start and in the end. there is not much to in end game but build, there is no reason to build but if u do getting resources i boring and repetitive. building big estructures is also annoying have to spend hours placing each block of ur huge castle but i can deal with that if getting the blocks was not boring.
Bosses are not challenging most mobs are easy.
There no real reason to explore cause the rewards u get from exploring are not good ( except the totems but u can also get them from pillagers raid ). the structures are small and not impresive and the challenges they bring are easy once u did one there is no real reason to do it again. Make minecraft have season so there is more variations in every biome.
Villages are also boring, it could be cool if we had another villager updata and give more personality to villages and villagers, make them progress expand their cities go to war or be abble to hire them to explore the dagerous nether. Have diferent arcitecture for each type, cause now is the same house diferent color or blocks and its boring, all vilagers from the same village are the same the only diference is their profesion, make them have families so i care about them.
PvE is boring since most mobs are easy to kill and only have one attacks that pretty boring they a variety of attacks that u have that are simple and easy to learn and predict but challening. They could add like mobs attacking ur base making have to build a base to protect form these attacks, they could also add mobs variants like a bigger zombi thats good at breaking, and esqueleton that try to take things from ur chest for example, they could change depending on the biome and season
i like the nether.
The end is cool for a boss but there is no reason to return other then to get an elytra."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,"So, the only thing I would think to be inappropriate are swords, bows, and death. That's it. If you are fine with these things, your child can play this. It's also really simple, fun, and creative."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,its a simple game and a really fun one to and to play it you need to be creative and have a good mind and you can just play freely and build whatever you want
"Teen, 13 years old",age 13+,
"Teen, 13 years old",age 9+,"Minecraft is a game where every thing is blocks
it can be fun to play but younger kids should be in a mode called Creative where kids can play and bulid pertend houses until there hearts disire but in Survial mode there are monsters that kids might be scared by."
"Teen, 15 years old",age 5+,"Theres no point to this game. It gets boring so fast. If tou like exciting video games, this is not for you. But, there can be creativity and other cool things"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 16+,the game which is for making somethihg
"Kid, 9 years old",age 13+,"To start off with. There is no safety controls for the chat. Hence you have to go with friends that you trust and not swear. Secondly, if you go to creative mode / you go on survival mode you don't have to worry about others vandalizing your stuff. But in a nutshell minecraft is a really amazing game but you have to be careful of people attacking your bases on multiplayer since it will make you cry if you really worked hard on a build."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 5+,"great for kids, you learn in it and you could build houses and many things. very little violence and the characters dont even talk, it is safe for kids and perfect for older kids that like crafting."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 6+,"This game is great and it encourages you to be creative. There is minimal violence as players can be hit by zombies and other mobs drawn in an extremely cartoony style. This is easily good for ages 6+ and mature 5 year olds. There are online servers that you can join if you have an account, but parents can turn this off in parental controls on the Xbox app."
"Kid, 7 years old",age 6+,You can build anything
"Teen, 15 years old",age 2+,"I've seen lots of karens saying stuff like ""OmG mY LiL aNgeL wAs TauGhT sWeArs FrOm MulTiPlaYer!!"" ...Lets be honest here, your kids know swears. Plus there is a thing in your child's forehead called a brain, so they won't give away personal info. I also see parents saying they saw their kid kill an animal or monster, and that their kid will become a mass murderer. No dummies, even an unborn fetus knows not to replicate anything in a game. The red that appears on a mob when you hit it is NOT blood, but an indication that you hit it. Sure, in multiplayer some peeps look for gfs/bfs, but there is such thing as leaving the server.
NOTICE FOR KARENS
•there is no drugs in minecraft.
•there is no s€x in minecraft.
•the minecraft youtube videos are not ""toxic.""
•may i repeat, YOUR CHILD WILL NOT REPLICATE ANYTHING IN MINECRAFT.
•*sighs* your kid already knows swears.
also ik im not a parent, but i put it under ""parents say"" so karens notice it."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,"minecraft is a fine game for children six and up, it only has mild violence and it also has an educational value, if you want you can minecraft education edition. there is no sex/adultish things in minecraft. there is no swearing unless someone in your game writes a bad word in the chat. kids can do so much creative things in this game so its very good. if you do not trust this game you can play it WITH your child. I'm even writing a book about this game. i dont really mind if you guys dont agree with me. bye"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 8+,this game is amazing even my brother plays it. I love this game so much.
"Kid, 9 years old",age 3+,good
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,"I have played Minecraft since I was five and it has been a life changer during covid! There is no blood or gore and it has soooo much potential. I have played about 2000 hours in total and I don't regret a single minute of it. If your child is young and is scared easily just turn off the monsters with peaceful mode and put them in creative, heck I didn't like survivial at first and didn't play it till I was eight! Also a few notes:THE NETHER IS NOT HELL. It is just a dimension with lots of fire. Summoning golems is not a satanic ritual! If you don't want children to play with strangers then just tell them not to play with strangers! If your child asks for it just get it for them because it's a great game that has been thriving for over a decade. Also bedrock edition (The one for tablets and consoles is better for younger kids because there is better online safety. although it does have in app purchases.) If your kid is a0 up get them java (The one for computer) java has a more adult community but has NO in app purchases and has more game features."
"Teen, 16 years old",age 16+,"Right, In this game you can commit war crimes, burn down villages, boil people alive with magma blocks and water with a roof, child abuse you can kill Baby Villagers, Piglins. you can also be a terrorist and blow up towers, deforestation, slavery, Murder on Minecraft servers. you can force breed animals, eat animals, kill animals, burn people alive with lava (players &amp; villagers &amp; Animals) there is also phobias in that game like if you don't enclosed spaces, or your affraid of the dark, or spider. there sword, crossbows, gun mods and many more things in the game. some can be avoided but it is the main things you need to do to survive so not all avoided. and the game does have creativity, and art, architechure. but the game is very addicting and much more when you have a Autistic, ADHD Son/Daughter. you can also trade with people in the game."
"Kid, 5 years old",age 8+,"Minecraft is a good game for kids that have a field of creativity! Players are welcome to build anything they like! There is a large menu of materials for players to build like wood, iron, obsidian, well you get the idea. Players can also play on Minecraft servers like Hypaxial to play with other online people. However, there is a downside to this wonderful game unfortunately. When players are starting out, they need to kill animals to get some food and other stuff, just, WHY? Also, some people tend to kill villagers to not let them become zombies, this even counts as killing other people, WHY? Also, there are some scary sounds in Minecraft, the creepy cave sounds and Disk 11 and Disk 13's unsettling themes. In addition some blocks are scary too, like soul sand. However, most kids do not notice that and keeps on playing. This game can attract many children to play it, so they might get attracted to Minecraft. Remember to always keep track of your kids screen time! Some people might talk to children on servers about bad things like sex. Overall, this is a great game and it has a little bit of danger inside it. As long as you don't play on servers, you're definitely safe!"
"Kid, 8 years old",age 13+,"Minecraft is a good game, but your child can get online on servers. And there may be swearing in it."
"Teen, 17 years old",age 2+,There is nothing wrong with letting you kids play this game. It encourages creativity and there is no blood in the violence and it can be used as a reward for after they do something for you.
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,"Minecraft is a double thumbs-up. Lots of people play this game, and if you don't know Minecraft, basically it is an virtual world where you can take blocks from the game and place or delete them on a 3D world. There are TONS of blocks: different colored clay and terracotta blocks, sand, pumpkins, clay, and the list goes on and on. There is not only blocks too, there are things like doors, boats, and even animals! If you put the mode on ""Survival"", you must survive in the world by building things you need in order to survive, but you start with no blocks, so you have to find some!
It is a great game. However, there are a few things that push it just a bit pushed to the violent side. First it has fantasy violence, and has a bit of violence because you can kill and torture animals in the game(From ESRB rating(E10+)).
However, there are lots of educational opportunities, because it symbolizes real life in some ways, but also with fantasy added as well.
So, that is all for today, hope this review helped! Thanks for reading!"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 10+,It is a fun game and it has creative and survival mode and there is a lot of creativity!!!
"Teen, 13 years old",age 13+,"In the game, many can join the Favorite Youtubers and have fun with The best SPEEDRUNNER is Dream him self."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 4+,"Minecraft is good for all ages, the only reason I put 4+ is because kids under that age probably don't know how to play it. Yes, you can kill animals, but there is no blood or gore. You can build awesome stuff, and it brings out creativity. There are also cool servers, which introduce many new ways of playing. Hypixel and Shirecraft are the best. Also,the Nether is just a place to gather recorces with challenges. And the end has a dragon in it. If your kid asks for Minecraft and you have the money, buy it for them. You can even play it yourself. I have been playing it for 9 years and I still love it like I did when I first got it."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,I love this game so much and it is not violent at all except for the killing mobs that try to kill you. They do ask for a lot of money for minecoins but other than that it is highly recommended!
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,It is good but i dont think that anyone under 8 should play on public servers but its a good way to stay connected with friends and make new friends as well and its very fun
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,Ever since I got the game for a gift from my mom ive been playing it for hours. on my best world i have a villager breeding area and more. love it and let you have multiple idea of what to build. keep updating!
"Kid, 11 years old",age 7+,"Minecraft is easily one of the most popular games on the internet, along with many good reasons why.
This game allows you to either play survival mode, education edition, or creative mode. Creative mode allows you to build or do whatever you desire without having to have limitations on you resources or without losing hearts.
Survival mode allows you to build, but you must work to find the materials and other necessities.
Education edition allows you to experiment and learn about different elements of the periodic table. It has also other learning features.
There is some mobs in the game, which will attack you in survival. You can use some animals for food, and a sword is included in the game.
Even then, it is still a good and easy game to play."

"Teen, 14 years old",age 7+,"MInecraft is awesome! However, parents should know that playing on an online server is harmless. Nobody ever uses the chat so all you do is just play online. My sibling got this when they were like seven and they also have never been bothered by anyone online."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 5+,"so minecraft has a mobile version and a pc version, my brother has the pc version and i have mobile and we love playing it all the time, this is fun and unleashes creativity, meaning you can get blocks from your house and put them into mc and make something! thank you legend Notch and jeb, also this game is not violent, when you attack something it just goes into a red filter for a second then when you attack it enough it will just go to a red filter and fall and might drop something depending on the mob. i recommend this game to 5+ probably because if your younger you won't be able to do much, i really like the redstone in minecraft, i am a redstone artist, TO ALL PARENTS AND KIDS, this game is something you should definitely pay for, its worth it"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,I have been playing Minecraft since i was 6 years old. It is very fun and educational game that encourages creativity and promotes motor skills.
"Kid, 10 years old",age 9+,
"Kid, 8 years old",age 8+,This is the best but it was still paid but its okay because the phone version is 7$ You can make a house or fight zombies and survive that game is better than ROBLOX
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,
"Kid, 11 years old",age 8+,Creative mode is the best because it has lots of parts I can use. I made a cool house for my roblox character.
"Kid, 11 years old",age 4+,"Great game for kids who are creative and want to build stuff but cant in real life, 4+"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft is a great game for young kids because it promotes building, math, and creative skills. If you have a very young child, don’t set up an account, but let them play. If you set up an account, you can join different games and talk to people. Unlike Roblox, Minecraft does not have a chat filter, however it is unlikely anyone will curse because the community is usually kids. It’s easy to play."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 10+,"This game is AMAZING!!!! Although, the game has mild violence, so it's better for the age 10 and up!!"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 2+,"This game honestly sucks, the graphics suck, and there is no blood or violence, i have no idea why it is 8+."
"Teen, 17 years old",age 5+,"Don't listen to the overprotective parents who say, ''ThIs GaMe HaS sWoRdS tHaT mEaNs ThErE iS vIoLaNcE'' There is no blood or gore, and the 'monsters' aren't scary at all. You read the reviews, and if you still don't believe me look up, ""Minecraft animals"" and you'll see there not scary at all.
This game is not like ""fOrtNiTe"" and stuff like that. Its a relaxing game were you can build houses, forts, caves, parks, planes, (etc)
Really whatever want. Let your imitation go wild!"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,"The blocks I love! this game allows you to go to the minds limit!
But there is creepy stuff and sounds which can make it scary"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 7+,"By far, one of the greatest video games of all time! In this game, you can choose to survive or create with no limits! In creative mode, you can fly, take no damage, and have unlimited resources. In survival, you are limited to your wishes about the game, where it is a challenge to survive. You can do whatever you want in both gamemodes, in creative, you can build huge villages, mansions, castles, machines, or adventure maps and let your imagination run wild, and in survival you can fight, hunt, and complete whatever challenge you set, beating the final boss(enderdragon), or perhaps creating an abode for you to live and take pride in. If you have a younger one (ages 5-7) you might want to stick with creative or survival in peaceful mode (no monsters or threats). I also prefer to keep them off of multiplayer servers( where random strangers play). There is also a nether dimension which is supposed to be hell, so keep them away from that if it offends you. There is local multiplayer, where you can play with family or close friends. If you're child is older, loosen the limits, but keep an eye on their public activity on servers. Have fun!"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 4+,"I started playing when I was 6 and I thought the monsters were scary, but then i just went to play in creative. My 5 year old sibling just turns her worlds to peaceful. When I was 9 I started playing survival. But what I'm saying is that other games I've played I enjoyed them for a year at the most, then they just got boring. But for me, MINECRAFT HAS NEVER GOTTEN BORING. Though I would use the servers with discretion because sometimes they are inappropriate."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,This is da best game in the world 10000000% fun
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,Great game no blood or any thing violent but 5+ because of the controls on consoles may be hard and frustrating for younger kids.
"Teen, 17 years old",age 10+,"Parents doesn't want to let their kids playing minecraft because they said it is too scary because there's monsters and too violent with an lot of blood. But no, these monsters are not real and I mean zombies, skeletons, creepers, and witches. But I promise you, those DO NOT exist only on minecraft. However, parents just write those negative reviews because they have never tried minecraft and sees their kids playing it. Honestly, you should let your kid have fun playing minecraft and don't let them stop what they're doing don't ruin their fun parents. I've been playing minecraft for over 5 years back in 2016 now! And, my parents NEVER ruin the fun for me which is great! Sometimes, they just check on me and then they go away. Minecraft is really an good app and it doesn't need negative parents."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,"People think it is very violent, but its really not. The most violent it is is killing pigs for food and killing mobs. There is different gamemodes however. There is creative, and survival. (And hardcore, easy and more on java. the computer version.) In creative, you have NO VIOLENCE at ALL. All you do is go into your inventory andfind blocks to build stuff and or explore! There are villages in all modes, and different cool structers. You can also join servers. One is Sharks server, and the ip is Anubis.gg on java. or you could join on bedrock and it is bedrock.anubis.mc I suggest this server and go to survival. Many people are nice and give you SUPER good armour."
"Teen, 17 years old",age 6+,"I grew up on this game and the screenshots above are not that accurate. Those screenshots are from 8 years ago and the game looks a whole lot better. Minecraft pocket edition is really easy to use and is great for on the go creativity. Also, if you have Minecraft on Windows 10, PlayStation 4/5, and Xbox one, you can connect to the same worlds and servers. Also, Minecraft PE has easier controls in my opinion. Love the game!"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,
"Teen, 16 years old",age 2+,
"Teen, 14 years old",age 7+,
"Teen, 16 years old",age 3+,"If you want yo kids to cry all the time and feel isolated from friend groups, don't let them play Minecraft. This game is amazing in every way. Nearly every aspect of the game conveys a certain beauty that both entertains and mentors."
"Teen, 16 years old",age 4+,I got this game for my 7 year old nephew And he played the hell out of this game on my IPod: This game can have multiplayer And chat And people can bully you this game includes fantasy violence which isn’t a problem for me but it can be a problem for other people
"Teen, 15 years old",age 6+,Just don't let a TOO young kid play this.
"Kid, 8 years old",age 6+,minecraft
"Teen, 15 years old",age 15+,
"Kid, 9 years old",age 6+,"There is violence but no blood or gore. You just turn red, but then move on. Also, it encourages creativity. My favorite part about minecraft is that its not scary. You can mine, farm, build, explore, cook,enchant things, craft, and defend your friends and yourself from monsters. You can go on servers and chat and build and play minigames. They dont bully or do anything bad, and i know that from experience. It also has a filter. Please let your child play this. They WILL have fun. (my cousin does.)"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,"This game is so fun, since there are many modes. One mode is where you survive, doing stuff like mining, farming, fighting monsters, and getting wood. The other mode is creative mode, where you can build whatever you want with a variety of blocks. I love playing with my friends, and it’s one of my favorite video games. It could update a bit more often though, but still a great game."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 10+,"I would rate this game a 5 if it were less expensive to buy as a full game. Heaps of kids like playing Minecraft, but there is minimal violence and you kill other people and animals for resources or food. 8 and 9 year olds are a bit young to experience doing this, it's also an online game and kids are sneaky, so if they were asked to play offline by their parents, they would still play however they desire, usually being online. It's better to play offline though, since people can't comment inappropriate or mean things about anyone that way and your identity is protected. Parents may think kids should be around 12-13 years old before they can play this fun sandbox game because of the violence, but I'll say it again - 'it is only minimal' - so it would still be appropriate for 10-11 year olds to play too. That's just my theory."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 2+,"Minecraft is a 3D game where you can build, hunt, trade, and play with other people in many minigames!
It makes you creative and has different mods. It's very easy to play and makes your kids learn how to survive (Except some stuff lol)
Even if ""killing"" animals is not fun, how do you get meat and chicken? Animals were killed to provide us food and that's what Minecraft put for us too!
This is an amazing game and really recommended to play."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 8+,play it so good
"Teen, 16 years old",age 2+,Tell other families what you think
"Kid, 11 years old",age 8+,"When I started to play Minecraft, I must have been around 8-9 years old. By then it was a pretty popular game but competing with Fortnite over popularity. Trying not to add bias, Minecraft is a bit better then Fortnite. Although you can kill animals and people with swords and bows(on a multiplayer world, which is your choice to add/create,) Minecraft isn’t based off guns and battle royale, such as Fortnite. Also, it is your choice to add multiplayer aspects, such as Minecraft Realms (multiplayer add one to the game.)"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 4+,"IT IS SOO fun really cool you can go on srevers and play online or just play alone. if you have a slibing you can play with them, you can play with tons of stuff. it not modern like bow and arrows. ect anyways there is no blood in the game. very fun. but i just dont understand the hate it a really fun game. you dont have to use the chat. and you can tell on a player and blox them"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,Minecraft is probably one of the best games out there. You can have fun playing mini games on servers and you can also work on a single player world. I recommend playing with Shaders and resource packs because the graphics are a bit bad compared to other games.
"Kid, 10 years old",age 2+,"My child loves this game and I am happy as long as he is happy. If you dont know what this game is about it's basically a game where you have to craft supplies and try to survive the night and build a base. Also you have to fight dangerous monsters named ""mobs"". It's really not that violent of a kids game if you ask me. If you do want your child safety to be important then just simply tell him/her she cannot play multiplayer. cuz if you let your kids play in multiplayer which I let mine, but if you do there is a chance adults can say and build inappropriate stuff. All and all 10/10 game. I let my kids play all the time, but I wouldn't suggest this to vegan parents because in the game you have to forcefully breed animals and kill them for food but that's basically what you have to do in real life so good game."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 5+,"So I've been playing this game for 4 years and I love it. I am having fun with building Redstone contraptions and buildings. not such a fan of survival, but it's ok. Mojang keeps adding new things and updating the game well. My parents are interested in the game and like to see my builds. My advice to parents that are scared of the effect of the game on their child is to be more interested in the tiny details. The game is fun and educational. I personally learned English from it (I'm not American or British). Many parents think the game is causing violence and a lousy effect on school. But I played the game for 4 years, and I have one of the best grades in my class, and I never use violence. So I think it the best game (Among us good too)."
"Teen, 16 years old",age 5+,"Minecraft is a great sandbox game. . The game is not scary. You can do much in it, the most popular thing to do is go onto survival and survive until the end :). It was one of my first ever most liked games from when I got my console❤. I still like it :). I've been playing it for like 2-3 years. If you're worried about how it costs, don't worry just buy it, you will not regret it :)."
"Teen, 15 years old",age 7+,
"Kid, 11 years old",age 7+,
"Kid, 12 years old",age 2+,Minecraft is a very great game
"Teen, 14 years old",age 3+,"Game is great.. Almost been playing the game for 10 years. Really encourages kids with creativity. Trust me, it's good for your kids. Don't feel convinced? Check the trailer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmB9b5njVbA&amp;list=PLC-SzJAaEAFfKQv_JCSZuR..."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,"First off, Minecraft is a game that is made out of blocks. There is little actual violence, the graphics are simple and cartoony. If you ‘hit’ a creature it turns red for a split second to tell you that you have hit it and it will run away if it is passive, and if it is aggressive it will ‘attack’ the player. The same thing happens to the player- They turn red and get pushed away. This only happens in survival to the player.
The only concern I would have if a (younger) child should play it is that if you get your child an Xbox Live account, they can join servers. This needs to be monitored because you can talk to people on there. However, the chat blocks most words on the main servers and also the servers that I have been on didn’t have anyone talking. The role-play ones have the most chat and (for a young child) ‘inappropriate’ things.
You can also join anyone using the same WiFi as you unless you have a child’s Xbox Live account with modified settings.
It is a really fun game and before you start panicking about scary characters, you should actually play it with your child."
"Kid, 8 years old",age 8+,This is a good game you might wanna know why well its because you can let your kids imagination free but you sometimes it gets too crazy but its a good game you can play with other people and make friends so this is a good game!
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,There are very different ways to play minecraft and there are ways to play multiplayer but the problem is that anyone can talk to your child or you and they can be dangerous so there are privacy concerns but if the player is supervised then it is ok:)
"Kid, 8 years old",age 7+,Minecraft is a good game for building! If you dont feel like Minecraft is for your child watch them play Minecraft on any of there IPad or IPhone! I play it on my Nintendo and its easy and fun do play!
"Kid, 9 years old",age 8+,Minecraft iPad /phone/laptop is a fun version of the video game but some kids may like it more in certain modes. What parents need to know is there are two game modes survival and creative.If your child likes to fight zombies and other mobs than survival is good for him/her. But if your kid likes to be creative and build houses and what and other stuff then pick survival.
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,This game is great and it's appropriate I mean you can build so people might make inappropriate builds but other than that it's good and appropriate
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,"I think Minecraft is a really good game for kids because you can learn life skills and you learn how to hunt for food survive. I feel this game is for 7 and up although there is a chat where you can chat with other players, but there is an option to turn it off. So I feel Minecraft is a very good game for kids like me."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 10+,"This game is amazing and so interactive in a good way, but you should chat with your kid about servers and multiplayer. Players can bully other players for no reason and can be just plain ruthless and cruel. My sister’s friend’s brother blew up her house and all her pets along with it in a world. Also, in an LDShadowLady fun craft video a griefer blew up her whole house, thus ending the series. Other than the occasional griefing and bullying on servers, this is an awesome and fun game that has little to no violence in it. There is no blood or gore, mobs and players just flash red and then disappear in a puff of smoke, leaving items behind. The game can get tense, I can tell you that, but in creative mode it is just building and satisfying exploration. I hope this review helped!"
"Teen, 16 years old",age 3+,"Excellent ambient music, you have the ability to build whatever you like. You can also join user generated servers and in Java Edition there are tons of frees mods to change the game in basically any way you want. On the topic of the various 1-star reviews, these people have never played the game and understand absolutely nothing. They're a bunch of Karens."
"Teen, 15 years old",age 2+,"Such a great title, force them to play this awesome game."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 9+,"This game is okay. There are safety and privacy concerns because of online chatting and kids can go on to other people's worlds, even if the people are strangers. One thing I don't like is that you can kill animals and zombies in minecraft. My brother got this game before me and he started calling EVERYBODY in different worlds his friends. I don't think he even knows who they are. There is also something called Herobrine. He is apparently a ""ghost"" that has risen from the dead and haunts people's worlds. I don't know if this is true or not because it hasn't happened to me. so just be aware of this. To stop zombies from coming into your world, you have to set the game mode to peaceful when creating a new world or of you are in a current one, go to settings and fix game mode. also, you can go to creative where you don't have to kill animals and you can freely build."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,"I think Minecraft is a good game because you can create things such as houses, buildings, and have fun. You can also play on servers and play fun mini games."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 8+,"Such a simple game, but one that has endless possibilities. Of course survival is great, you start with nothing and become extremely powerful later and look back at your progress, which is fun but multiplayer is the cherry on top in this game. Playing with your friends, building bases, farms, slaying hostile mobs, bosses, having wars, duels, and SO MUCH MORE. I highly recommend hypixel as well, it has bedwars, skywars, skyblock, build battle, housing and so many more games its insane. Not to mention the lore in this game, I recommend watching game theory/matpat because the lore is also so cool. I recommend everyone to get this game because it's worth it and you'll be enjoying the different gamemodes for hundreds of hours. Minecraft has something for everyone. Also, to those parents who think minecraft has violence, yeah sure but it's not all violence, minecraft can even teach kids about the importance of animals and how we can cherish them and make them our friends."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 4+,"This game encourages creativity in many ways! If you don't like that play with mods, the ""market place"", other people's maps, and survival mode! You can do lots of stuff in the game create in many ways and use your imagination! This game should be 5/5 stars in my opinion."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 3+,"Minecraft is clearly the best game. Why should you buy it? Here's why:
Minecraft is extremely educational and encourages creativity. Turn on education edition to mix elements to make sparklers, balloons, colored torches, underwater torches, etc. Redstone is Minecraft's electricity. It is so fun to experiment with! Build anything from a medieval castle to a tropical resort! There are so many educational and creative factors.
Educational Value: 10/10
Breed animals to get more animals and in turn more resources, animal breeding is not inappropriate at all. If you breed two animals their heads meet and a baby appears. I just realize I should name one of my cats Worf... (I have a cat named Jadzia in my world) There are settings in your world to prevent strangers coming in, and I don't recommend servers.
S*x, language and privacy concerns: 3/10
You can brew potions to give you special powers like invisibility, slow falling, night vision, etc.
Drinking, Drugs, and smoking: 0/10
The game is $7.00, but it is totally worth it. (and way cheaper than java, I play both versions) You can purchase minecoins to get safe community made creations from the marketplace. (ONLY DOWNLOAD FROM THE MARKETPLACE)
Consumerism: 3/10
You can kill players and animals, but its not necessary to beat the game, there are mobs that can attack you. Despite what some reviews say: there is NO blood whatsoever. Entities turn red when you hit them. You can turn off killing other players, and you can turn off TNT blowing up (end crystals, beds, and respawn anchors can blow up though)
violence: 2/10
Reccomended Youtubers: Eystreem
It takes awhile to grasp the basics, and people may call you a noob, but true friends will help you out."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 4+,"Minecraft is a fun and easy game. Like 4 - 8 years olds can play on Minecraft just not server’s. You can play on Minecraft whatever age you are if you approve of this game. I’ve been playing for 2 years, and I am ok with the little violence and scariness. Just don’t play on Minecraft servers if you are not ok with rude people on servers"
"Kid, 8 years old",age 8+,"I think it is really good
I like it when you can built whatever you want"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,"So Minecraft is great for kids, also they are making a new security update soon for Java edition at the start of next year. By they I am referring to Microsoft the owners of Minecraft. Minecraft is a great creative game and a infinite sandbox where you can build almost anything. Although I must admit there is one thing wrong... There is no chat censor so people can say whatever they like. So online I recommend for 12+ offline or with friends on Bedrock I would suggest to any age."
"Teen, 16 years old",age 14+,"a teens guide to competitive minecraft java
if u got minecraft bedrock then dont read this
1. install minecraft
2. install badlion client
What is badlion? It is an anticheat based client with game improvements like greater frames per second and better user interface. Competitive players like purpled use it. If you didn't know he is 4th on the hypixel solo bedwars leaderboard.
NOTE: badlion has a very strict anticheat, requiring you to run it as administrator.
3. Make your own skin
There are lots of good tools out there to make skins. I use need cool shoes. You can change your skin at minecraft.net. OR just find some youtubers skin. Its up to you.
4. Get a good mouse and keyboard.
Please dont play with a 1980s mouse. you wont get anywhere. It doesnt have to be razer or glorious like i do, but at least use an optical mouse.
5. Join hypixel
it is a mingame network. 2nd largest minecraft server in the world, and plenty of good and nice players
6. Practice and learn.
Find people who have experience at the game. I know plenty of people who can do all sorts of fancy things (how i learned to godbridge)

"Kid, 9 years old",age 8+,"I love this game and I currently have it, but the price is unnessecary. Does it really have to cost 25 dollars just for a fun game? I think Minecraft would be better if it didn't cost a lot of money, or at least didn't cost that much money. It's really sad to see my siblings have to wait to get their own Minecraft accounts and have to play on mine due to the cost and the price. But, if you have the time, the money, and no siblings that want it too, I think you should TOTALLY get Minecraft!"
"Teen, 15 years old",age 6+,"This game is one of the best pc/console/mobile games I've played. You basically live in a world comprised of blocks, that you can place and remove, like virtual Lego bricks. The only limits are your imagination. This game promotes creativity, problem-solving, self-direction, and collaboration. This game is ok for about all ages, and there is nothing inappropriate, other than some brief violence, which is still kid-appropriate. Highly recommend this game to anybody who loves sandbox based games."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,Minecraft is a great and creative game but servers can be inappropriate in the chat but overall great game and to the parents who do not let there children play that is ridiculous it is a game where you can make whatever you want and in survival there is no blood or anything gruesome
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,I have been using minecraft and many parents/caregivers have worried about there kids killing animals i will tell you how to stop this type of behaviour first create or tap the pencil on a world then go all the way down to the bottom of the page then it will say turn on cheats after you see that you need to tap it the it will say stuff like there will be no trophies just tap continue after that you will need to turn mob spawning off then there will be no animals/angry mobs
"Kid, 12 years old",age 6+,"Have you ever been bored to death? You want to have some fun but you don’t know how? Well, play Minecraft. To spend 30 minutes of your time playing Minecraft is not a bad idea. It is a game full of adventures and quests to explore different biomes. When I first played Minecraft my brain exploded. It was so much fun that I begged my parents to download Minecraft for me. The texture is top-notch with lines and drawing to bring the object to life. The animations are remarkable because whenever you do something it looks realistic water ripples around you when you swim. The vision is superb because you can change the way you look at yourself. You can also change your hair and clothes in the settings. There are different views, clothes, and hairstyles so find the one you like best and start playing. There is also outstanding sound quality. Minecraft is made out of sounds. There are different cool sounds for each and everything. Such as how pigs go oink-oink, cows go moo-moo, chickens go quack-quack, grass goes swish-swish. It makes Minecraft seem very realistic. This is why I think you should definitely play Minecraft!"
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,"Minecraft is a great game and is really not that violent. Some parents complain that there is swords in the game, but they never notice that they have let their kids watch Mulan so I am really confused. Anyways Minecraft is wonderful and encourages creativity since there is building! There is also a mode where you spawn in a random world and need to get tools and build a house to survive from zombies and skeletons and other hostile mobs. Minecraft is great!"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,parents should understand that this game is a fun game but you need to teach your kid not to destroy other ppls build for fun and make sure that they understand what they are doing
"Teen, 13 years old",age 8+,"minecraft is a truly wonderful game that encourages people to build whatever they can imagine. You can fight monsters in survival, or build freely in creative. You can even play with your friends on servers!
Easy to play: Minecraft has fairly moderate controls and doesn't take much time to learn. see minecraft wiki for tutorials. As for in game play, there is a lot to learn, but feel free to research when needed.
Violence: Yes, Minecraft does include fighting monsters and killing livestock to survive. But the only weapons are swords and bows.
Sex and swearing: some servers may include innapropriate content. if your kid is young, I recomend supervising them while playing online.
Drinking: Potions can be brewed, but they don't intoxicate you, they just give you abilities like jump boots
Saftey: Supervise your kids in case players provide links."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,
"Teen, 13 years old",age 10+,"This game is fun, you can put hours into it and still be playing but OH MY GOD! How the computer version is overpriced and each time you get an update your system gets more and more destroyed."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 8+,"Not saying it's a ""Rip-off"" or whatever, but it's not as great of gameplay on the tablet, honestly. And I wouldn't worry too much about the chat, because that can be used in useful ways, such as ""commands"". What I would worry about instead of the chat is the servers you join; if you are in an appropriate server, you shouldn't have to worry about the chat too much. There is no blood or violence, so stop criticizing it for having swords. I would definitely recommend the Laptop/PC version more. If you are a parent, you can censor what your child does more. If you are a kid, you will have more fun, unless your mom or dad turn off literally everything. And no, I don't hate Minecraft. I really love the game. But save your money on the computer ver. instead of this. And NGL, your safety protection is probably not as secure in the Pocket version :V"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 5+,LOOK IN SETTINGS OR IN THE MENU INGAME TO SEE HOW TO PLAY EASE OF PLAY 3
"Kid, 11 years old",age 10+,this game is fun. my gamme favorite
"Kid, 12 years old",age 8+,it's creative
"Teen, 14 years old",age 6+,"First off, I am seeing a lot of parent reviews concerned with inappropriate things going on in chat. this is almost never the case, and if you want to play on a multiplayer server, then most likely the chat is censored, with the option to report players.
Second- parents are concerned with the killing of animals. seeing as the graphics are very blocky, and there is no blood or gore shown, I don't see that as a huge issue. also, as you get better, you can go vegetarian-which is what I do. Farming is better in value than hunting. The violence isn't that big of a deal, when something takes damage, they just light up in red, nothing else, and tip over if they die. Sure, it can be frustrating if you lose all your progress, but there are plenty of ways to ""cheat,"" including going into Creative.
Last off, I started playing when I was 7 years old. Now, as a teenager, I still play regularly. That is how much I enjoy the game. There is no end to it, no way to beat it. everything you do is entirely up to you! even after you have defeated the ender dragon, wither, and gotten elytra and netherite, there are still plenty of things to do! Yes, I understand the game costs a bit of money to download, but this is not a game you child will just play once, beat, then never play it again."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 7+,I love this game and play it by myself and with my friends online. There is a chat function that some people use incorrectly but not often. single player is so much fun and easy to play. Overall get this game it is totally worth it!
"Kid, 9 years old",age 5+,Minecraft should be for five and up. It encourages creativity and may help a child’s imagination grow.
"Teen, 14 years old",age 4+,"Minecraft is not what other people say. If a four year old were to play all you would have to do is set the difficulty on peaceful and let them play. No Monsters, No hunger or need to kill anything, and very easily one of the easiest games to play. Minecraft Also has creative where your kids can build whatever they want. And if you are worried About people randomly joining you can turn off multiplayer. Last there is a built in Chat Filter.
Great Game"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,Age what's it's 5+ but personally I think the game is the definition of garbage. Moving villagers is th most pain full process ever experienced by a child. Moving villagers to your iron farm for a life of endless labour on a boat should be made easier and that is why this game is only 3 stars. Mojand fix your game.
"Teen, 13 years old",age 10+,i love them
"Teen, 13 years old",age 11+,"The game is great. There is little violence.
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS MULTIPLAYER.
Hackers can use YOUR ACCOUNT to say things. So you can get banned from servers because someone else HACKED YOU.
Do not friend random people you don't know. I suggest if your going to use multiplayer PLAY ON YOUR OWN WORLD AND LET FRIENDS FROM REAL LIFE JOIN. NO ONE YOU DONT KNOW.
I have experienced a lot of hacking because I play a lot of games that DO have hacking. If I see a hacker I can immediately tell that it is a hacker. If you don't know much about hacking and what can happen THEN JUST DONT PLAY MULTIPLAYER. Even if you find a friend on a server and think they are nice... its still dangerous.
I don't recommend multiplayer for ANY game if your under 13 years old. Anything that HAS a chat. Is not a good choice.
I do enjoy playing multiplayer and I enjoy the community on the PMC website(Planetminecraft.com) I do enjoy playing on servers. But here is the thing.
Playing with my friend on ""Bedwars"" on a server(Basically you are trying to protect a bed that lets you respawn[mini game on a server]) Someone started yelling at my friend in chat. Saying he was bad at minecraft. Obviously I really was mad. So what I'm trying to say is that... If your playing multiplayer and think your really good at something someone can come along and call you trash. It can really make you upset if someone calls you mean things. This is why multiplayer on a Minecraft server(or any other random world on Minecraft) can be very dangerous and it will end up someday very upsetting.
I love Minecraft singleplayer. Some might think a sheep turning red and then going POOF out of existence is bad? I don't understand why something disappearing is violent. What is violent is someone saying mean things about you.
MY TIPS:
PLAY SINGLEPLAYER
OR... PLAY MULTIPLAYER WITH -ONLY- FRIENDS AND FAMILY"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 8+,"Minecraft is a sandbox game where there are settings that can be whatever you'd like such as peaceful mode or hardcore mode if you're daring enough there is also creative and survival, creative is you where you can fly and not have any problem looking for food or worry about your health which means you have god-like powers where you can just go in your inventory to choose what you want. You can make a GIANT mansion or pixel art with types of materials (Such as coloured wool or bricks). I recommend it a 10/10."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,"I can not stress this enough! I absolutely LOVE this game! This game is an AwSoME time passer with many different features. It does cost money though. But it is 100% worth it. If you want a fun game, this is the one!!!"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 5+,"Right, I started playing this at about seven years old. I really enjoyed it then. For the parents that say “It’s to violent.” for their kid, remember that they are pixelated characters with no gore. In the game, you can type signs or in the chat. The chat/signs disable any signs of cussing. If your child likes to play in the online areas such as murder mystery, I recommend 7-8+ because you can chat with strangers. If allowing your kid to do this, then I recommend talking to them about “chat” before allowing them to play."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,It's an amazing game that builds upon your imagination and creativity. Every kid that wants to should play it.
"Teen, 15 years old",age 7+,"I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Due to the infinite possibilities, the game can provide endless fun.
This game can develop a growing mind by increasing creativity, encouraging teamwork, and developing strategic thinking.
The violence in this game isn't as bad as other games due to it being unrealistic. When you kill a player, an animal, or monster in the game, they fall their side for one second then they disappear. The weapons in this game are swords, bows, crossbows, TNT, and a fireball. There are others, but they are rarely used.
In the online aspect, I would say 95% of servers are safe for kids. And if you're concerned about privacy, settings can be adjusted in your Microsoft/Xbox family settings page to your liking."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 8+,"I love minecraft, it is educational and is also really really fun, Highly recommend this app!"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 7+,"Minecraft is just an amazing game! There are endless- truly endless possibilities. I think this is so inspiring, and this is the best out of all the sandbox games I've played. It is so diverse, you can do so much with it. And you can adjust the settings to any of your desires! There isn't really any violence because as a world of blocks, it doesn't connect to real life in such a way. And the animations of damaging an animal or something are completely child friendly, so please don't worry parents. This game is definitely not harmful to children, and if you have concerns, take care of it yourself. Such as, don't give them a Bedrock account if you don't want them online with strangers - teach your kids responsibility so they don't go doing something they shouldn't be doing. Aside from that, my review for Minecraft is five stars out of five."
"Kid, 8 years old",age 8+,"Great game! Minecraft is very creative and fun! Although players can kill animals and get attacked by other players or monsters, with it's blocky graphics it is not violent. It is very versatile with it's options and has great educational values. Players can play online or offline."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 5+,Look UP
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,"I've been playing this game since i was 6 years old, the whole fandom is amazing, there are parodies to songs, different and unique skins, servers, mods and so much more (most of those are mainly on PC) You can play the game in many different ways like creative, survival, adventure. This game has been a huge part of my life for ages and i strongly recommend, boosts creativity and teaches about stuff too, like minerals, rocks, how to make glass, you can use this game in real life! I love this game."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft is great to play!!! The only two problems for age is the first being violence, but there is no blood or gore, and it's perfectly fine for 6 and up. The other one being consumerism. But kids can live without it, so it's okay."
"Kid, 8 years old",age 7+,"Good for older kids, some violence (no gore) and building"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 4+,"If your kids enjoy creating or designing things, this game is for them! So many things to do and create! The game also gets updates to make the experience that much more fun. Definitely worth the money!"
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,"Great game! There is a little violence in the game though. But it is mild. If you mind, try putting the mode to peaceful mode so the only violence is like killing a pig for eating. Overall, a good game."
"Teen, 17 years old",age 8+,Good good good
"Kid, 12 years old",age 7+,Fun endless gameplay no blood or gore when fighting and can be educational in creative mode.
"Kid, 8 years old",age 7+,"Finally, build whatever you want. The reason I gave it three stars is the blocky graphics and the fact it is a rip-off of Roblox, it also gets boring sometimes. Mild Violence: People have to defeat monsters in the game, no gore is seen."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 4+,
"Teen, 13 years old",age 8+,Very good game encourages creativity and ease of play
"Kid, 12 years old",age 2+,"I played this for ages, and to be honest it's a brilliant game.
Very little violence (no gore, you just get hit and when something dies, it can drop stuff)
It's extremely easy to play and gives you no instructions, as the whole point is to leave you to do whatever you want."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 5+,"the developers are so slack 'pixels are easier to code' well we want high quality not easy, roblox is better"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,I really like Minecraft. That’s all I have to say. :)
"Kid, 11 years old",age 5+,"I’ve had Minecraft for over 5 years and I’ve created some amazing builds, it really brings out your creativity! About 2 years ago I made an account to play online, and I haven’t seen any swearing and/or inappropriate conversations in the chat in all the time I’ve played. People are very nice and love helping eachother out to make incredible builds, and they all share and team up to get things done faster. A really good way to teach teamwork and creativity. Recently my 5 year old brother got Minecraft and knew exactly how to play all from watching Minecraft YouTubers like DanTDM, Grian, and more. He even made an account with my help! He now plays online with me all the time, and we build together. Plus, even if he sees some rare swearing in the chat, he won’t understand it. There is NO violence whatsoever, NO blood whatsoever, and EVERYTHING is blocks. Way better than Pixel Gun 3D or something. Yes, you kill animals and monsters, but all you do is hit them and they dissapear into XP. My little brother never has had nightmares about killing the monsters and animals. He even try’s to kill me in game and doesn’t think much of it! Perfectly fine game. Kids of any age can play it, as long as they know how to walk! It’s a bit hard to learn the controls, but if my little bro did, you can as well."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,Fun and creative game that most people can easily enjoy. A bit of violence but nothing too bad.
"Kid, 12 years old",age 5+,Pocket Edition has been upgraded. 1.16 there is violence but so mild that you can do PVP and not have nightmares for years (Take that Karen’s) I’ve played for years. Killing animals is necessary for survival. Creative you can but burning down villages and slaughtering villagers is a bit too far (I’ve done it myself) But the violence is VERY minimal so it should be good!
"Kid, 9 years old",age 6+,Awesome game good for building.
"Kid, 11 years old",age 10+,
"Kid, 8 years old",age 7+,Minecraft is a bit boring. All you do is chop down tress destroy creepers build your house find useful materials repeat.
"Teen, 13 years old",age 13+,
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,Minecraft is an awesome app which kids of pretty much any age can build whatever comes to mind. 10.00 $ Canadian dollars is a great price for ranging materials from wood to stone to diamonds to concrete to carpets and many more. Kids can learn mechanics through red stone and others. Definitely worth a spot of storage.
"Teen, 14 years old",age 4+,"Great for kids of (almost) all ages. It has violence, but no blood, gore, or anything like that. Great for kids. It can be difficult sometimes. People also need to know that not just survival mode can connect online. Creative can do the same. If you want to play single player, press the online button off."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 9+,"life lessons

"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,"the game is great, you can use your imagination and build pretty much whatever you want just, it is sometimes a little laggy and glitchy. and why do you have to buy mine coins? like why can`t you earn them in some way? and i wish when you buy addons it didn`t make the game lag terribly. and some times, when i visit my friends, the game kicks me out of the server for no reason. but overall, the game is OK ;)"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,"Just because minecraft involves killing animals, doesn't mean it is bad. You kill these animals to survive."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 18+,HE KEPS MAKING VIDEOS ABOUT THIS WEBSITE AND GAME INCLUDING HIS DUMB STUPID MINECRFTPT LIFE SUNG BECUASE OF COLD MIOL; ILL NEVER PLAY THIS HGAME AGAINNK!!!!!!!!!
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,"Minecraft allows your kids to explore an amazing cubic world. If you worry about monsters that spawn in the night, play on peaceful. only cows and other friendly ""mobs"" will spawn around you in the peacful game mode.
If you choose creative, you will have all of the items to your disposal, which lets you make whatever you want! (with some exeptions)
The use of education edtion allows the building of periodic elements using science. You can also get modifications which change the way you play the game, such as making chickens giant. More recently, a shop has been made where you can buy ""minecoins"" (the in-game currency) with real life money and spend them on cosmetic items and maps/skin packs."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 10+,This game is great to develop and great whatever you can imagine I play it for many years and I love it I consider it to everyone there is no age limit to play this game and is one of the most popular games in world some people including my self we call it a LEGENDARY game we all gonna remember. ( one of the best games world has)
"Teen, 17 years old",age 6+,Very nice game its really fun and unlimited stuff. no more words
"Kid, 11 years old",age 9+,This game allows you to be creative and have fun. You can either play survival or creative and make many coded things.
"Kid, 11 years old",age 7+,"This game is really cool. You can build stuff and fight monsters, plus you can play with your friends."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 3+,really good for building exploring and playing with friends
"Kid, 10 years old",age 2+,This is a great game it has some things that are a little bad for really young kids but only if you go to the nether which is basically heck
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,"In Minecraft you can do almost anything. I'm not kidding. You can build a city or a castle or a house or a garden or a statue or explore the seas or fight monsters or find hidden treasure or whatever you want. It's easy to learn, and when things die, they just disappear in a puff of smoke. There are two different modes, creative and survival. In creative, you are immortal, have infinite resources, can control weather and time, and can fly. In survival, you must survive monster attacks (not scary and look like blocks), find food (farm wheat, carrots, potatoes, hunt pigs, cows, chickens, steal bread from villages), and find materials to build pickaxes and swords. I think it boosts creativity, is not too violent or scary, and is great fun!"
"Kid, 8 years old",age 4+,you build survive i love creative(creative is pretty much UNLIMITED BUILD MODE!!) i play on a tablet absolutely love its worth paying for $6($5.99) if you have a 4 year old or higher if they can work a tablet/ipad/computer they can play. oh and they can also learn how to make contraptions with redstone/pistons/sticky pistons/redstone lamps/lever/buttons/pressure plates/block of redstone/dispenser/redstone torch theres just alot of things i may or may not of included them all im not sure. you gotta play. bye! :-)
"Kid, 9 years old",age 6+,I think it is a great game. when you get it for a small child ( 5-7 ) put it on creative or they might have nightmares about the monsters and all the killing and stuff. I think you should get it for you kid or maybe you.
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,"This game is not violent, it’s perfect for little kids"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 5+,"THIS IS THE MOST BEST GAME EVER!!! This is the best game for kids , teens and adults . This increases a child creativity and this is fun with friends. but be careful with online servers ."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft is really great, and it doesn't have very much violence at all. The only violent thing is that you can kill things. However, there isn't any blood, the dead thing just disappears in a puff of smoke and sometimes it leaves things behind that you can eat or use. It's not true that just because you can die and make swords Minecraft is violent. It's really cool, and it lets you be creative! Minecraft is amazing and wonderful, and I will tell Brokenstar to come out of the Dark Forest and attack anyone who says differently!"
"Kid, 7 years old",age 8+,"Minecraft is a kid-friendly game which is suitable for most children. Mild content I would say, about a TV-Y7-FV rating."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,"This game is awesome! It has two modes:
Creative mode and survival mode. In creative mode you can get blocks and build cool stuff you can also invite friends to play with you but ONLY your friends which is good. In survival mode you have to mine for blocks, craft weapons, beds and build houses you can also invite your friends. There are'monsters' in both modes. In creative mode they can't do anything. In survival mode they can damage your in game health. But you can kill them in both modes. Once you kill them they just disappear in a puff of smoke. There is no blood. Plus the 'monsters look cartoon-y'. There is one more thing you can do. This is play on a server which is online with random people. Luckily there is no chat on servers. On servers you can play minigames. I think it's for kids age seven and up."
"Teen, 16 years old",age 5+,"To be honest, all the parents are being dramatic about the violence in this game, i’ve had this game for YEARS and the most violent thing is the animals turn red when you hit them. I mean, seriously?! I’m about 16 and I’ve had scene I was 6. There a swords in this game, yes, but there aren’t knives or guns, or smoking. SOMEBODY SAID: I BOUT THIS TO EARLY FOR MY 7 YEAR OLD SON, ONLY GET THIS FOR YOUR 8+ CHILDREN. Are you kidding me!?! CHECK THE AGE LIMIT DWEEB!!"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 10+,When I was 10 me and my friend had nightmares about Herobrine existing in Minecraft. We had to take a break for a while. Minecraft was also a waste of money beacause I couldn’t use multiplayer after paying lots of money for the game.
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,"Yeah minecraft has violence but its nothing terrible, you hit things, no blood, no gore, they just fall to the ground, turn red, and disappear. You can express creativity and imagination and all that stuff, but also have fun with friends and the great server community. If you are worried about your kid experiencing bad Language then turn of the chat in setting or go on the server press the chat button and then type a curse word and if it doesn't go in chat, or makes it hashtags you good ."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft has a good reputation, and I totally agree. It is suitable for any age because of creative mode where you could make anything, and survival mode where you have health, hunger, can’t fly, and must collect your own items to build. Kids under 6 should first be taught about the subject of death, because creatures and the player can die. However, there is no blood or gore and they just turn in to a puff of smoke."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 5+,"I love it! It's fun, creative, kid-friendly and safe. If you play online, still safe-unlike games like roblox with bad moderation (e.g no result when reporting someone)-and it isn't violent or inappropriate. It allows you to create your own world, by yourself or with friends. Trust me, 100% kid-friendly and safe, You can't go wrong with minecraft! Also, whatever parent raised concerns about minecraft, you got it completely wrong. Not me nor anyone else I know has had a dodgy experience with this game. I LOVE IT!!!"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 5+,
"Teen, 15 years old",age 10+,"So, I started playing Minecraft when I was about 4 or 5. I don't remember it clearly but I was playing creative mode and making really crappy houses, and then my computer stopped working and now I have a new one. My brother made me get it on February 2020
but I don't know the date. I played it so much and got addicted to it. It was so addicting I wanted to see what other people were up to. So my brother gave me a link to a website with server IP addresses. So, I did the thing that everybody does when they see a public server they want to join; join it. There were a lot of people saying the F word and the S word. I felt very uncomfortable and left. I then joined another server and I saw somebody with a skin that had no clothes on. I left that one too, of course. So, my point of view is that be careful what servers you join. There can be people swearing and being inappropriate.
This is my longest review ever,

"Teen, 13 years old",age 18+,the game now has nasty content.
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,"This game is the peak of mobile gaming. A game where you can build anything and your only limit is your imagination. You can start in Survival Mode where you start with nothing and build your shelter and fend off monsters. (They are not too scary) Or, you can start in Creative Mode where you have unlimited resources and you can fly, so you can build anything. There are dozens of online servers you can play on with real players. Or, you can just play the game with a few of your friends. This clever game is the best mobile game ever created and it has stood for almost a decade."
"Teen, 14 years old",age 9+,"I paid for the game and then when a year passed it told me to buy it again.
WTH?!
ARE YOU TRYING TO STEAL MY RICHES?!"
"Teen, 17 years old",age 4+,Good game where you do stuff
"Kid, 12 years old",age 4+,Minecraft is a amazing app that makes it super fun to build with your friends.
"Kid, 12 years old",age 2+,"Barely violent, you hit things with a sword and your screen go red when you die."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 2+,"This is such a creative game with a lot of blocks your child can play with. If you think there is ""violence"", you just hit mobs with a sword. Worth your money!!"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 3+,"This game is easy to use and play, although multiplayer is a concern for parents, parents need to quit focusing on the killings of animals and bosses. They also need to just get used to it, although some things are religious or whatever. (Note to parents: This is a game which you survive or build in, based on which mode you select). But kids need to learn when they are adults or want to hunt seasonally or make their own farm for food in real life, you have to kill animals for food. Or if you're vegan, there are vegetables and fruit in the game to eat, like potatoes and apples. Also, quit ranting on the Nether (Even though I'm Christian, I play in the Nether, which is based off of H E Double hockey sticks) I know people get the wrong ideas of the End dimension and you kill humanoid creatures called ""Enderman""
But it's a FICTIONAL game, it shouldn't affect your life. It really shouldn't. If you are a tree advocate or a animal advocate (Like stupid PETA) and your children like this game, dont tell them ""Hey, I'm deleting Minecraft because there is animal violence and you kill things and other players, and that trees are important to the world"" ITS FICTION!!!! Just leave them alone and just give your kids a life to enjoy, if they don't believe killing animals for meat should be banned or cutting trees down should be banned in Minecraft, then it's fine. Just leave your children playing this game without a Wifi connection and this game should be enjoyable."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 9+,"Hi
Minecraft is a fun sandbox game where you can build, survive and play online with other players. There are two modes, survival and creative. In survival mode, you have to gain resources and food by destroying blocks and punching animals until they die. As grim as it sounds, it really isn’t. The only violence is hitting a monster or an animal or sometimes another player and when hit they turn red and take damage. In survival mode you can die. In creative mode, you have unlimited resources and can do or build whatever you want. If you do not wish to play with other people you can always turn it off in settings. There are servers as well where you can play online with others. Don’t be concerned about your kid talking to other people as people don’t really talk on the servers I have been on as they prefer playing the game. Minecraft can be used to teach kids about various things. Minecraft is an endless game with endless possibilities. There are no ways to finish the game but there are objectives to complete if you wish. Also, please parents, limit the time the kid can play games as Minecraft is addictive. There is also “Marketplace” where you can buy skins or maps to play on. You need Minecoins which cost real life money. Apart from that there is no other in game spending.
Thanks"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 18+,"In this game the goal is to murder children. It is horrific, Violence, Sex, Gore. If you want your child to end up in a mental hospital, buy this game."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,Minecraft is super duper fun you should download this right now! :D
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,"After reading parent reviews saying survival can connect to other worlds (wrong there is a multiplayer section dedicated to that) I can now officially say half of my brain cells are gone. In the game you are a block man in block land and you must kill animals for food, get wood for a house, and fight off mobs who want to eat your brains,
With exeption for the creeper he just wants to ruin your life. You have to go and talk to village men sometimes and they trade with you but just like real capitalism you always lose. Sometimes you can kind and you can also craft, this is fun and also building is fun."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 4+,"Minecraft is a blender of possiblities, with a little time and energy, you're imagination has come true, dream house, town (i even built a town with buildings that my classmates and friends wanted)
Conquer the over world? Go for it!
Want a city named after you? C'mon letz do it!
Minecraft is a blender of possibilities!"
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,Minecraft can be a little ruff when it comes to survival mode. And sometime playing online is bad when other people that swear.
"Kid, 10 years old",age 2+,"Minecraft is an amazing game, and is always adapting so much. If parents (or kids) are unhappy with the actions of servers, there are always ones to play that are intensely monitored, feature ways to report, and don’t allow chat. Minecraft does weekly updates to fix bugs or any errors players encounter. I also love the new customizable skin feature, and am very happy with my skin’s look. Another feature that pleases me is the XBOX, or multiplayer feature. Me and my sister love playing together, and for the multiplayer to be a free, it’s just wonderful. It works great only my iPad and it really makes me happy. I 100% recommended this game."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 2+,"It's really good and appropriate for all ages! you may be worried about playing multiplayer, there's something called a christian minecraft server where it's a server with no swearing. plus, you don't have to go on a server. you can just invite people you friend and you can only friend someone if you know their username, so friending random people won't be a problem. or you can just play singleplayer! also you can turn on an educational mode if you want, and it subtly teaches kids about geometry and stuff like that! i highly suggest you get it! i honestly don't get why ERSB rated it E10+."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,"All the parent's who say it is bad are FULL of baloney they are lying 1# THERE IS NO BLOOD 2# In creative mode you can use your creativity
and that is it! (I think)"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,Guys and parents reading this i don't warn u anything but just let your kid have freedom.
"Kid, 10 years old",age 5+,"This game is really good! However, in Some Minecraft servers, things can get a bit out of hand, as players can start swearing, but that can be easily fixed with a chat-bot. Other than that, it's pretty easy to use!"
"Kid, 9 years old",age 8+,
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,Absolutely awesome and creative
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,"I adore playing! It's so fun taming all the wolves and having them follow you around as you pet them and give them affection. I actually have my own world with over 80,000 wolves ;)) I also have the same thing for parrots!! Its very fun and educational. I even build houses and learn different textures and colors. All you over protective and weird parents need to understand you simply just hit something like a chicken to kill it for meat. Smh lmao. It doesn't even show blood so you crazy parents need to stop over reacting. Jesus, calm down"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,"Well I started to play Minecraft on my phone at 2015. The only thing that ripped me off was the price tag of $6.99. But it was amazing and cool new updates. It may contain violence and fear, but still a worthy spin-off."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 3+,"It is educational, fun, and safe! The servers tend to add inappropriate stuff. I mostly like to play in the hive or the Mineplex."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 9+,"Minecraft is LITERALLY age 9 and up!why are people saying stuff like:this should be rated M for mature when it is RATED E FOR EVERYONE!its dumb! Who are these people on common sense media with NO COMMON SENSE???!!!but anyway,I’d recommend this game for your children if you want them to keep being the awesome kids They are.i mean,this is Minecraft.you can build ANYTHING you can imagine!!this is the PERFECT game for you’re children."
"Teen, 14 years old",age 7+,"I have been playing this game since 2013. Minecraft helped me get over arachnophobia. The reason I am giving this three stars is because of the toxic people. If there were no toxic people, then it would be a five star. I am only basing this off of the bedrock and xbox 360 versions of the game."
"Teen, 17 years old",age 11+,It keeps jumpscaring me with the creepy sound
"Teen, 13 years old",age 4+,"The whole game is SFW! There is literally no gore, no violence, only the mobs that attack you at night, but they don't even have blood, and your screen only shakes a bit when you get attacked. You can customize your kids' settings so that they can't even play multiplayer so they're one hundo percent safe! Please, if you're a parent of a &lt;13 child, setup safety permissions so that your kids can not see vulgar language! Even if your kid is on multiplayer, swear words get hashed out! (That's for Bedrock Edition)
Java Edition is relatively the same as Bedrock, 'cept you get a free bedrock edition code when you buy java, incase you want to see what win10 edition feels like.
In Java Edition, swear words don't get filtered out, but you can easily see if your child is on any server, and, if you think they might be hiding something, check the realms page, check the direct connect button. It's nearly the same as bedrock! Oh and, you can even put in mods for your child to enjoy minecraft java even more!"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,"The grass blocks scare me.
I am kept up at night knowing that physics don't exist in Minecraft (besides the sand and gravel)
My dog (in-game) died in Minecraft the same day I made got a diamond.
THE GRASS BLOCKS ARE SO SCARY OLS NO PLAY PLEASE
GRASS BLOCKS ARE SCARRY I'M NOT LYING DON'T PLAY MC PLS
I WAS KILLED BY TNT
I HAD A GRASS BLOCK IN MY INVENTORY AND I COULDN'T SLEEP FOR TWO WEEKS
THE GRASS BLOCKS ARE SO SCARY
THEY LOOK LIKE GRASS I HATE IT
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Minecraft needs to make it so that I can have no textures
My friend told me that dirt blocks are the same as grass
I am never going outside my wooden Minecraft house ever again."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,"I have played minecraft for like, 5 years now? And I am in love with it. The game is fun and entertaining and has updates where there is always something new to explore, or get. I've read some reviews and people talking about the game and I am suprised to see people who have not even played the game once call the game ""racist"" and ""not for vegans"" because it's just really stupid. In minecraft, you can make a farm and grow crops, you don't need to kill animals. And the game is not racist just because the enderman is black. I'm not gonna say anything about it, just stupid. Only thing you should worry about is going into servers cause people could bypass the very simple swearing filter. Other than that, the game is great and has an AMAZING soundtrack."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 4+,"Minecraft is an amazing game and I have never been scared of it for longer than ten seconds at a time. The only reason I was scared in the first place was because I was in a cave and a bat flew out of nowhere.
My 6 year old cousin has been playing this game since she was 4 and she loves it. She of course needed help at first, but once she understood she started having fun in creative and now she plays in survival all the time.
The game isn't as violent as some people make it out to be, you just take something (Most commonly your sword) and hit a mob with it, and the mob momentarily turns red and looses health. You continue to do this until the animal disappears, leaving a puff of smoke and (Usually) some items that it dropped upon death."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,"It's very interesting game, with a lot of creativity! The monsters don't make you have nightmares cause all you need to do is hit them (and there's not even blood!).
-------------------------------------------------------------
SURVIVAL:
You need to survive within 4 modes: Peaceful,Easy,Medium,Difficult. Each mode is more difficult than the other. You have falling damage.
-------------------------------------------------------------
CREATIVE:
Your imagination can be real in this mode! You can craft and build everything you want! You never die.
-------------------------------------------------------------
ADVENTURE:
Like survival but you can't break blocks.
-------------------------------------------------------------
A small detail: Most servers now have a new feature which don't let other player say bad words (or see bad words in the chat). That means there is not swearing at all!
That's all! I think I helped you!"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 5+,"I am an 11 year old. I enjoy playing Minecraft. I will list a few things about Minecraft.
What is Minecraft?
Minecraft is a very popular game which is made of blocks. You can mine, kill enemy mobs, craft stuff, build anything you desire, and much more! There are a truck load of blocks you can use. There are also countless mobs in the game like the endermite, silverfish, bee, zombies, skeletons, spiders, creepers (they sneak up behind you and explode) enderman, wither, and ender dragon! There are way more mobs than this. There is SOME violence by mobs trying to kill you, you killing mobs, there are swords and bows. There are three game modes.
Survival
In this gamemode you have to survive, craft, mine, defend yourself from mobs, and go on cool adventures! There are options to change the difficultys which are easy, normal, hard, and peaceful.
Creative
You can fly, get blocks easily by pressing E (for pc) and looking for the block you desired. You can break anything instantly. Mobs cant hurt you. You can only die in creative by falling into the void (by breaking the bedrock layer)
Hardcore
Kind of similar to survival, but you can only live one time amd the difficulty is locked on hard.
Other Notes
The grind can get boring but don't worry! There are new and cool updates to spice up the gameplay!
Now what age would I recommend? If your child knows what goes on in Minecraft then you can let them play. I'd say 5 or 6.
End
This is the end of the review. I hope this made you atleast think about getting this game.
I think this is one of the best ganes if not the best."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,"This game is fun at first, but after a while it could get boring just putting blocks down and killing animals. Sure, there is a creative mode, but there is really no objective. In other words, minecraft SUCK!!!"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,"I've been playing Minecraft since I was in Kindergarten (6 years old) and at that time, you didn't have Xbox accounts, but a year later, they added Xbox accounts, but I think it's a good game to play overall."
"Teen, 16 years old",age 10+,be careful of what mods are downloaded they can contain anything from relastic bleeding/wounds to sex animations and to mods that do nothing but a desigend for people to buy to get money
"Teen, 16 years old",age 6+,I bought a in game pack and it didn't work. I emailed the creators and they said to bad.
"Kid, 10 years old",age 2+,"Very creative, very fun, very cool.
However, if your child is age 4 and lower, I'd supervise them on servers as servers could have privacy concerns and name calling etc"
"Kid, 9 years old",age 8+,"Very good game!
Controls to walking: AWSD"
"Teen, 17 years old",age 7+,"Minecraft is an amazing game for me. Sure, there are creatures that plan to eliminate you at night, but that just teaches your kids that you have to survive. It teaches them to be brave. The moderators do an AMAZING job to stop bad things from happening. This game teaches kids to be creative, and that they can do anything they want, and that they can make anything they want. I'm not a parent, I'm a 17-year old teen, but i noticed that this amazing game has encouraged kids to be creative, even though I don't play it myself. But I have tips for you again.
1. Don't talk to strangers, or don't chat at all.
Sure, your kids can talk to their friends, or cousins/family members who play the game, but don't let them talk to strangers. But if you want to protect your child, don't let them chat.
2. Teach them what's wrong and right.
Toxic people, toxic people. Sad to say it, but they exist, and they can do bad things through hacking, so that the moderators won't stop them. If your child sees something inappropriate, then why not teach them what's wrong and what's right before playing?
Keep in mind that this is just my opinion, and of course, you may have a different one, and that's totally fine with me."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 7+,"It is an overall good game which inspires creativity.
It has little violence as it only happens when you punch something
The game controls can be a little tricky but with the help of an adult you could manage playing at maybe 5 or 6"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 5+,I got this game when I was 5. It took around a month to get the hang of it but I love it and I still do! There’s many learning opportunities for children! There is a way to play multiplayer but you can turn it off.
"Kid, 7 years old",age 6+,"I think you should be more than a little kid like 5,4,3,2, and 1"
"Kid, 8 years old",age 6+,"So, I ain’t good at this. I only played it once, but, downloading it? Family agreed. 4+ ratings? I agree too. Nothing like hacking or sex, or violence. My mom, which is really bad at saying games are appropriate, even agrees. It’s kinda educational, building a house, building rivers pools, mining, etc. No one out of my family and my friend’s family even minds the price anymore! So I would say, great game."
"Teen, 15 years old",age 10+,"Minecraft is a game for kids around age 10-15. It's a good game, but can be better. It's very much fun at the beginning, but when you have it for a while it will get boring. The pets you can have are boring to. You can't do any more than just walk/fly around a world and build some things. It wil make kids addicted and theres much violence in it. Why? Because you can kill people and animals and monsters. It can make you scared."
"Teen, 16 years old",age 7+,"Creative mode lets kids with creative minds to build anything with hundreds of different block types. There is survival mode where you need to gather resources and food and kill bosses. THERE IS VIOLENCE BUT VERY VERY MILD. There is no guns, there is swords and bow, and mobs/players just get hurt with no blood."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 2+,"Minecraft is an amazing game about being creative and learning to strategize.
To parents that haven’t heard of Minecraft, it’s really fun to play and easy to use and gives your child the ability to do what they want and build things they want to build. Imagine being placed into a world of blocks and nothing else, surrounded by different biomes and many opportunities with no limits on what they can do, that’s Minecraft doing what does. Yes you do have to kill animals for food but there are alternative ways and it’s just an overall fun game for kids and adults alike."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,"This is by far the best video game ever! It's more realistic than Hugs &amp; Hearts, but less violent than Call of duty or stupid old Fortnite. If you don't like this you are a Smoothbrain!"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 4+,"This game is very fun and a great way for children to get creative and have fun with friends while still keeping it 4+. I would recommend this game to everyone. Yes there is violence, but no blood."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 8+,Its a good game
"Kid, 10 years old",age 8+,"Minecraft is an educational game. It commonly is ignored and thought to be a violent game. The thing is, it's not. It does not have any REAL violence and by real I mean like major violence. Minecraft is good for kids."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,"Hello, my name is David and I'm 13. I have playing been Minecraft for 5 years. Minecraft has little violence and yes, you choose what you want to do. You can kill animals and have food. It's a survival game. You can play online with no voice chat. But Minecraft does have a chat. Minecraft's chat is heavily moderated and it censors inappropriate language. I recommend Minecraft for kids ages 5+
Your welcome!
David"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 8+,"I have been playing Minecraft since the mobile edition came out, and I have loved it ever since then. I think the only concern is really servers. There are some good servers (The Hive is my favorite) but there are also a lot of bad ones. I have found that the ones you find online tend to be less safe for kids. Minecraft does give a list of 5 or 6 servers in the actual game itself and they are all safe, although the chat is still enabled on them. I have yet to see anything really inappropriate in the chat on any of those servers. I hope that this review helped clear up the whole server thing for anyone."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 5+,"This is a great game. You can build almost anything you can imagine, download maps to have adventures, and meet new people on servers. Take it from me, a player for almost 7 years!"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,"This game is perfect for anyone who loves to design and build amazing things. Anyone can play Minecraft. Even if you are not that great at building things, it's still fun to explore the Minecraft world."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 8+,"if there are any parents looking at this, i need to tell you one thing: this game is great! there isnt really any volince, and theres nothing that should give your kids nightmares. get your child this game. (btw can be scary at times when a zombie drops form the ceiling, but zomies rly are not creppy at all.)"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,"The game is fine, its what you play it on. This version, Pocket edishun, stinks. The only reason to play it is cause if you link a microsoft acount, you can play on servers, witch means you can play on whatever severs you want if you have the ID for it."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,"Nice landscapes but a bit of self defense and food gathering (yeah animals have to die if you can’t get crops fast enough). Microsoft has added a few new features so that tag if no consumerism is void, there’s an in game shop. I recommend (NOTE: this doesn’t cause violence in your kid or teen)"
"Teen, 16 years old",age 2+,minecraft
"Kid, 12 years old",age 8+,"minecraft is a fun heaveally addictive sandbox/survial game
you can kill animals for food and catch fish but tbh i dont see anything wrong with minecraft its a survival game you gotta do what you can to survive duh sure i understand some parents might have an issue with the killing but the only time you kill something is if its a animal that you kill for food or its a monster that you kill to defend yourself minecraft i think is good for all ages i think the game has a little bit of violence and suicidal refrences yes you can drown to death in the game but mostly i think its good"
"Teen, 16 years old",age 15+,Its online and offline millions of random people who make the game fit every bad catoraty and I been hacked in the past no I didn't do any that could give away my password and its pay to play even after buying it. also spiders
"Kid, 11 years old",age 5+,"Minecraft is a great sandbox game that is very fun and I recommend it.
There is nothing wrong with the game, but I do feel like on some servers you shouldn't be able to say swear words, but that's pretty much it.
The controls are very easy which is one of the reasons that it is 5+."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft━It's a simple game with controls and two game-modes, creative and survival. It's also a major way to interact with others while bonding with them stronger without even knowing!
Creative mode━A very easy and simple start for a child who's around the age of six years old. No skill is required, so you can just jumble around with the buttons and blocks. Build a tower, a house, or a basic box. Be creative! Your builds don't have to be perfect.
Survival mode━Well... if you can handle the monsters. Skill is actually required. You need to defend yourself from mobs, gather resources, and actually be involved in boss-fights. However, don't go mining immediately for diamonds in the first few five minutes and rush through the whole game. It's a whole new experience just for you!"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 7+,"Minecraft is a creative game where you can build things. Of course for young children, i expect that you turn off the online worlds.
I hear complaints spilling here saying ""THEY THROW SHEEP IN LAVA"". Seriously, thats what the game is about. Its a survival game. If you do not want the violence then why even give the kids minecraft? Your basically spoiling the fun. PLUS THEY RATED it Everyone. This violence is much better than fortnite. Believe how much killing fortnite has. This is NOTHING compared to that. So basically your going to soccer your kid around for just some small graphical violence? No IF, AND, BUT"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,"This game is addictive, but can fuel creativity to the limits.
And creativity doesn't have limits!
Meaning = infinite creativity.
This game is awesome. People can basically create anything they want. And I believe, if you learn Java, you can made mods (add-ons that add things the original game doesn't have) that people can download. Maybe even purchase for in game currency.
Goodbye."
"Teen, 14 years old",age 4+,Minecraft is a great game and brings out the creativity in someone to build whatever you want. I believe Minecraft could be for any ages not considering comprehensiveness of the game. There is nothing in the game that I've found that would be harmful to young children
"Teen, 16 years old",age 7+,this game has very mild violence
"Teen, 13 years old",age 4+,"Minecraft is a great and educational game. It allows kids to bring out creativity in themselves and be proud of their creations. If your worried about the online safety, as long as your child doesn’t have an Xbox account nothing will happen. The reason I say 4+ is because children under the age of four may not understand how to play the game, but it is still appropriate for them. Killing animals doesn’t promote violence, and it is just pixels. No blood at all, no violence either. Great game. Even I play it."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,"I've been playing Minecraft since 2012, and I've always loved it! I always played on peaceful as a toddler and on creative so I couldn't die or I didn't have to fight monsters. It's fairly easy to play, hold to break blocks, tap to place blocks or hit mobs/animals. On creative, it's all about building, on survival, it's about mining and gaining resources. It sounds simple, but I've been playing for 7 years now and have never got bored! &lt;3"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 5+,It’s cool but I’m mad that we already had three cat breeds and one dog breed and they just added more cat breeds. But other than that I really suggest you get it because it’s really fun!
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,"Well, Minecraft is a great game. I've been playing it (but not in servers) since I was actually quite little, but when you get to the stage when you can play online, it's sort of worrying. Lots of my friends have ""wives and husbands"" and cuss lots, and I've experienced a lot of hate and stuff like that, and people still find ways to swear. Plenty of nice people, but watch out for meanies. Fun!"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,fun minecraft thank
"Kid, 6 years old",age 6+,I'm never having nightmares about this great game just a little scary..
"Teen, 17 years old",age 3+,it is good for kids they can explore and build witch can help the mind and if your worried about blue light coming off the screen they have gaming glasses that hide blue light ones with perscriptions and one without
"Kid, 12 years old",age 5+,"I have been playing this game for so long and I think everyone should play it! Nobody should say it is dumb, because it is educational and fun."
"Teen, 17 years old",age 2+,"yes. I was just reading the parents review some one said it has violets yes this is true but the violent is family friendly my cousin he is a preschooler now and he has been playing it scene he could crawl, i read on here that other people join you that only happens if you friend some one or if its your friends friend and you can turn your wold to only invite or turn off multiplayer, its a fun game, i have played it for a long time now and i see nothing wrong with it, hope you enjoy it 2 :D"
"Teen, 15 years old",age 11+,"So it’s a good game and all but if you are signed in to Xbox live. You can play server and chat contain sex,swearing and. role players do some stuff that are not ok for kids."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,"I have been playing the PC version for roughly four or five years now and I still love it. If you want to know more about it, keep reading.
1. Modes
There are three main game modes: Creative, Survival, and Hardcore. Creative is great for those who want to explore their world or build creations, with flying enabled and unlimited resources.
Survival is for those who prefer to take the challenging path and work for their treasures, with limited health and hunger and monsters that can destroy you.
Hardcore is for the pro player, a very challenging mode, with only one life and much tougher monsters.
For those who are just starting and want to get used to the game, there is also a 'peaceful' setting you can enable in Survival, making it so that no monsters spawn and you don't get hungry.
2. Online Playing
In Minecraft, there are online servers that you can join. When you decide to take this step, I recommend searching for kid-friendly servers. These servers have security measures in place to make sure that you aren't exposed to swearing, personal info sharing, and cyber-bullying. But if you choose to not play on one of these servers, be careful. There are servers out there that are terrible places to be. Just always make sure to look before you play.
3. The Monsters and Killing
I've heard that this part of the gameplay seems a bit scary from others, so I'll share my opinion.
Most monsters drop useful items upon death, so sometimes fighting a few is necessary. When you deal damage to an entity, it flashes red and makes a 'hurt' noise, but there's no gore or blood. Upon death it tips over sideways and vanishes in a puff of white smoke. Again, no gore or blood. In my opinion, this is fine.
On the other hand, if you get nightmares easily, monster fighting might not be the best...there's quite a big array of monsters, ranging from zombies, skeletons, and spiders to witches, living blocks of slime (slimes), and endermen (tall, skinny, black creatures that can teleport and often make strange noises). And that's not even half of them.
One thing to know, though, is that in the entire game there is not one bit of blood. It is completely gore free.
I would say more, but I feel like this is getting too long, so I'll end. Overall, this is a great game, IF you are careful. Assess the person who wants to play and decide what they can handle. Avoid the non-friendly servers, and you'll be good. I totally recommend."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,"I have minecraft for about 5 months now.
It is very fun!I rekomand(don’t actually know how to spell) age 7 and up because for age 6 and down, you guys are still learning what is right so its best to not play this game because there’s a little killing…
For age 7 and up, its ok as long as you know killing animals is mean."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 5+,"Hello everyone! I have been playing this game for years now, and I can say that Minecraft is awesome. You can build houses, make mechanisms with ""redstone"", go mining and soooo many other things. There are two modes: Survival and Creative. In Survival, you try to survive by building a base to protect your self from the (not even a little scary-looking) monsters, finding food etc. In Creative, you have access to all the blocks and stuff, so you can build and do whatever you want. You can even fly!
Online servers are a thing, but your child can play alone or with people they know personally too.
I love Minecraft and I think that kids and adults of all ages can play it!
Thank you for reading!
(There are some inappropriate things in online servers, so be sure to check what your child does there if you allow them to play online.)"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 6+,"It has good physics, and you can learn from education mode. Also you can build your creativity. There are “monsters” but all you have to do is just tap on it and it just falls. Non violent. Also there is a non swearing filter in the chat"
"Kid, 9 years old",age 4+,"Hello! So today I am going to give you a review on Minecraft Pocket Edition.
When MC PE (Minecraft pocket edition) first came out, it only had one game mode that you could play in, Creative. It was released early and rushed out due to very, very high demand. Minecraft has improved greatly over the years.
In this paragraph, I will talk about the ""Violence"" that parents are complaining about. If you have read the parent reviews, you might have heard this popular mention: Violence. According to one review, this parent caught her son eating... Cow meat? Apparently this wasn't okay because the family is ""Vegan"" (vegan is NOT an abbreviation for ""Vegetarian"". Vegan is a different type of diet that includes not eating white sugar.). In the game, it is EXTREMELY hard to find fruits, veggies, and products that AREN'T from animals. You may be Vegan in real life, but that does not affect what children do in video games. If you are concerned with this, you can limit your child's play to 30 minutes- 1 hour. Or you can supervise them and make sure they aren't eating to much of the meat or animal products. Parents are also saying that this game is ""violent"" because of the swords. The swords really arent graphic and if you hit something with them (Cows, Chickens, etc.) you dont see blood on the sword at all, or any blood on the animal.
Second paragraph; another popular mention; beds getting placed next to each other. This topic ties with the ""sex"" parents are saying that this game has. Well, if you think about it, this is all a matter of opinion. You can supervise your child when they are playing if you are concerned with you child placing a BED next to a different one. Think about hotels. If a child decides to build a hotel, I don't see anything wrong with putting to beds next to each other, considering that hotels put beds next to each other in real life. Most servers have a mute chat feature (That allows you to mute the chat so you don't see messages.) This usually prevents any ""sexual interaction"" between you and other players. Just log out if you re being harassed in this manner or join a different server for that game.
This paragraph will talk to you about another popular topic among the parents; killing players/PVP. Pvp is an abbreviation for player vs. player. This is fun for many kids around the world. Killing players is basically pvp. If parents are concerned with the violence of pvp, keep you child on single player. There is no blood when you attack players, the player simply turns red for half a second, the same way animals show being inflicted with damage. Parents don't need to be concerned if they keep their child on single player. If you do let you child play on multiplayer, make sure you are considering what server they are on and if that server has a mute chat feature. (PVP games are popular places to be bullied on.)
The way we ended the previous paragraph leads us into the next topic; Online Bullying. Online bullying (AKA cyber bullying) occurs on Minecraft only because of the chat feature. This online bullying occurs also on most games/platforms that have a feature that allows players to chat with each other. Cyber bullying doesn't really occur very often on mineraft, however it can happen, and it usually happens in the form on griefing, or calling people ""Trash tier"" and ""Noob lords"" and ""Iv'e seen hamsters play better then you."" These insults occur mainly on PVP games (Survival games, Capture the flag, bedwars, etc.) However they can happen on parkour games, and the word ""Noob"" occurs often on the parkour servers.
This closes my review on Minecraft pocket edition. I hope you enjoyed.(I have reviewed other games and movies in the same format.)"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,it's just good
"Teen, 16 years old",age 6+,"This is great. It made my English skills better and made me a bit more willing to take risks and to face the future. For all the parents worrying about killings animals all I have to say is that killing animals in the game does not affect their in real life interaction with animals. But if it does make them hurt animals you should not let them play it. Keep in mind, this is only my opinion."
"Kid, 8 years old",age 7+,I Just Got Minecraft For Free But One Of My Friends Sweared Even Tho It's A Good Game! I Just Downloaded Little Kelly's Castle! THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,"I’m a normal house builder, but the selection of blocks is very impressive, even for mobile. If you want to play on servers, you have to have a Xbox account."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 7+,"Minecraft has 3 modes, creative mode, which I recommend for kids less than 10 years old, survival mode, which I recommend for kids older than 10 and hardcore mode which I recommend for kids older than 10 who have some experience with survival. In survival mode you start from scratch and you have to find food to survive. If you don't want your kid to kill animals for food there are many options for crops that they can grow. There are monsters in the night but if you don't want any monsters put the game on peaceful mode. Hardcore is the same, but if you die you don't respawn. Creative mode is a peaceful game mode where you cant die and build with any blocks you want without having to do any work to get them. I recommend the online servers for kids older than 10 if they plan to interact with anybody, but I was fine playing on the online servers when I was 7. If you want a kid younger than 10 to play on the online servers I recommend servers with moderators like Mineplex or Hypixel. There is a way to disable the online servers if you use Minecraft with an Xbox account."
"Teen, 14 years old",age 13+,this game is lowkey kinda sick
"Teen, 15 years old",age 9+,This game is the best although there is violence it is not to graphic.
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,"A fun game for anybody of any age, really! The only problem is the inappropriate names on servers. Otherwise the violence isnt bad and theres no blood at all! It's just a simple and fun game."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 18+,"so, i played minecraft on a multiplayer thing, and i saw people doing innapropriate stuff, so i never played it again! DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS PLAY MULTIPLAYER!!"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 10+,this game is cool because it's cool. you do have to fight monsters but there is no blood.
"Kid, 6 years old",age 6+,This game is very cool because you can build anything you want and see villages and realms from other people!
"Kid, 12 years old",age 8+,"This is a fun game for all 8+. Online modes can get inappropriate and unsafe. Just remind your kids to only play alone or with ONLY THE PEOPLE THEY KNOW. Besides this, this game encourages creativity and building."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 11+,
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,"The game is really good for kids imagination, not recommend for kids under 5 in my opinion
The game allows players to interact with each other
Most of the servers in the Java version have a swear filter but in bedrock it have a built in one (it's easily bypassed)"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 2+,"This thing is saying: “its scary”
Oh wow, I’m getting nightmares from building houses on Minecraft (sarcastic tone)
I reckon it should be more scary!"
"Teen, 17 years old",age 8+,"I think Minecraft is an awsome game. It is like the real world in it is a cube world. In this game you start of with nothing, absolutely nothing. You must survive this world with rare and hard to find resources. The first night is probably the toughest night for most people. with monsters who don't want you on their territory. You must live through this danger and make your world. Or Die Trying! The Minecraft world is yours to conquer! Play with us and join us in our mission to make this world our world! defeat these mosters and defeat the Ender Dragon! Make the Minecraft world Peaceful to the minecraft people and become the hero we are all looking for! We need a hero who will not give up and who will save our world from these monsters! Hero! Bring our world to peace!"
"Teen, 15 years old",age 6+,"I read the reviews and this game was horrible! People said it had ""Too much violence"" and ""Sex"". Seriously? This game is the game of life! While zombies and creepers and skeletons are questionable, there not realistic at all. You have to breed animals to get more animals. And there is not any human sex in this game. Very enjoyable game that a 6 year would understand and enjoy."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 2+,"Not as good as PC version, but good."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 7+,"There is nothing really wrong with Minecraft, the only problems are that young children may fear from mobs, and that you can play on online servers."
"Teen, 16 years old",age 7+,"Yeah it's good, get it
Oh dont let chirren under 10 go onto servers btw
Other than that get it"
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,it is a fun interactive game.
"Teen, 14 years old",age 6+,"I love Minecraft its a legendary game in which i have so many good thins to say about, But I'm here to talk about the ""Violence"". Minecraft does hold some violence but it mostly about surviving in a world ware your the only human. left there is only the aspect of killing animals and things that threaten your players life that i see, but even then its not that much and do to the design of the game it looks and feels very fake. Multiplayer on the other hand can hold lots of violence and killing, also give your child some rules before going on multiplayer because any one can talk to any one which means if your child is chatting with somebody they could give out personal information. So other than multiplayer Minecraft is a family game for people all ages with little to no violence.
P.S. I would also advise visiting 4-5 different sites and KID-Youtubers to get your final opinion on the game."
"Teen, 15 years old",age 8+,"People keep talking about ""violence"". If you are so worried about hitting an entity and it turning red for a split second, then well... don't buy the game? Also, I saw someone complain about survival ""connecting to servers"". Wrong. Survival is just the gamemode where you have to not starve, drown etc.
Anyways, great game, helpful community, well documented, and great for just sitting back and enjoying."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,
"Kid, 10 years old",age 8+,Its a fun little sandbox game for your kids! and it teaches you about the world!
"Kid, 11 years old",age 7+,"It's an amazing game!!! I play on servers and more. I have my own server. Beware the chat isn't filtered unless on a server (sadly)
It can steal your money. Gamertags can be rude and have gore in them.
You can kill animals and mobs. But that part of survival and creative.
I didn't play minecraft for a while because for herobrine overall THE GAME IS THE BEST"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 5+,"This game are creativity and learning stuff planning for house and survival gaming it should be allow to free but it will wasted your money like skin shop, but little bit boring stuff, it will fun to destroying stuff"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 8+,my mom bought me a ipad for my birthday last year . and i couldnt use it becuz i had no games but my mom bought me minecraft again a couple days ago and it is so fun. i build a really cool house andi loved it but a zombie killed me and i think i lost my game i dont know it said game over so i dont think i can play anymore. ths game may not be apropiate for little kids becuz u can kill sheep and pigs and zombies kill you and i died and if u dont want to loose your game llike i did i think i cant play anymore then dont die and i didnt know u could die when i played but u can and im bad at games so just dont die and u will not loose ur game like me
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,This game is great. It helps creativity and is really fun. Pick up this game of your kid wants a game
"Kid, 8 years old",age 18+,
"Teen, 14 years old",age 8+,"• VERY ADDICTIVE- you play for what you think is an hour and turns out being four (and then your brain is overstimulated and hurts)
• also VERY fun
•some violence, not any gore; sounds of animals dying are terrible sounds and you are most likely to kill animals to get food instead of getting apples (which are terribly hard to find); you must get wool for a bed (a crucial element in Survival Mode in order to avoid dying because a monster kills you) and there are two ways to do it: you can kill two to three sheep or shear them, but shears are very hard for beginners to make and they are likely to get killed before making shears if they do not kill sheep for a bed first
• CONSUMERISM: lots of in-app-purchases, some worth it, others totally not; the player is advised to create an account and use XBOX Live, and then has emails about buying MORE stuff sent daily
• so much fun but also expensive: it costs $7 (approx.) on apple app store"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 14+,
"Teen, 14 years old",age 6+,"That game is safety video game, the game had nether it is not really dangerous. I think the friendly mobs are very nice, the enemy is so easy to kill."
"Teen, 14 years old",age 14+,it's perfect!
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,"I love this game! Minecraft allows kids to be creative, use their minds, and solve problems. Two different types of gameplay so everybody can be satisfied. This game does contain small amounts of violence (however, this can be avoided) and the controls can be difficult due to the small size of phones and tablets. I would recommend watching a few videos and doing some research before buying this app, so you can see if this game is good for you and you child."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,"This game can be really fun. Although, when Minecoins came, it got pretty bad (not bringing that up again). The controls are really simple to use and you can get used to it really easily. The game has a bit of violence with thankfully no blood so if you don’t care about limited violence, this game is safe to buy. That’s the end of my (pretty bad) review."
"Teen, 16 years old",age 16+,
"Teen, 17 years old",age 4+,"I have had Minecraft since I was about 4? 5? And I loved playing it with my brother. I still play it today, and it is still just as entertaining. Show your kids this game, because it inspires kids to be creative. I remember building colourful cities and gardens, only at the age of 6 or 7. Some people are saying that Minecraft encourages violence because you can kill monsters and animals. I used to do this as a kid and I think I turned out okay. My only issue is you can go multiplayer on “servers”. Sometimes I here people say bad words on these servers, so maybe only let them go on those as teenagers."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 8+,"I find it a great game and it makes you think more creatively but it’s not for kids too young because a lot don’t understand why you have to kill things in the game and also it could make them think it’s ok to just go out and hurt pigs, bunnies, sheep, cows, or other things that they have to kill in the game. So I think 8+ is good"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 10+,"AWESOME graphics and AWESOME water and lava! Any person who says Minecraft sucks and rated it 1-3 stars doesn't deserve to play video games!!!! The only thing that is even CLOSE to killing is where the mobs turn red, fall to their right, and disappear in a puff of cartoony smoke. The coolest thing is the SERVERS. I have no idea what version you people (and entities) who are reading this are using, but in 1.2.3+ they start you off with 3 servers: Mineplex, Lifeboat Network, and InPvp (which are all minigames servers, including InPvP) Out of those 3, I like Mineplex the best. Anyways, 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 out of 5 stars! Also, if any parents come across this Death Star of a review, PLEASE buy this for your kids! They will love you forever for doing so!!! There are also some EXTREMELY cool seeds. Like the Woodland Mansion seed. FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TRY OUT THE SEED: I can't remember the seed OR the instructions so look up minecraft woodland mansion seed pe and find GameSkinny.com. Once you're on there, go to slide 6. The seed and instructions will be under the screenshot. Also, try downloading some maps."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 6+,It’s awesome play with a friend and build something cool!
"Kid, 7 years old",age 3+,I love it
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,"This game is amazing but sometimes has violence, but your character just. Turns red for one second. Great game, but you can chat with players in the world you are in."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 8+,"There are great servers available that your kids can play on and make new friends. There are 3 servers which are pre-loaded with the game which automatically filter out inappropriate stuff. However, there is a store where you can buy 'Minecoins' which let you buy skin packs and worlds other people made.
However, people can enter servers with inappropriate skins. If you EVER see anyone using an inappropriate skin then take a screenshot and report it to the server admins. That way these people will get banned."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 5+,
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft is a great multiplayer game,where you can do what ever you want. There is something called survival and something called creative,in survival you build your own houses and you go mining for materials to survive. In creative you are given all the resources to you,and you don't have to get them,so you can build houses Beyond compare and you can build swimming pools,and other amazing stuff. So this game is an incredible learning about the world game, I highly recommend it."
"Kid, 7 years old",age 6+,This game is soo fun!!! It's so easy after you play it a few times!!!
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,this game is very fun and is appropriate for all. anyone can and should play this game. it has multiplayer and single player modes! amazing game that encourages creativity.
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,
"Kid, 11 years old",age 9+,"Minecraft Pocket Edition is one of the most creative, layered and fun games I have ever played. It is not extremely scary, although for very young players the sounds some monsters make could be slightly frightening. If this might be a problem for your kid, they can play in Creative mode, where your character cannot be hurt by monsters and has unlimited resources to build with. If your looking for something exciting, try playing in Survival mode. In this game mode, you search for food, craft weapons and can build a shelter to protect yourself from monsters. One reason this game is very fun and different from other games is that you can basically build whatever you want, from an underground hide out, to a horse stable in the sky, too an epic diamond mansion. There is also a learning element to it. When you kill animals for food (which is not gory) they drop the kind of meats that animal would produce in real life. Also, you can see what happens if lava and water mix together, or explore a cave to go mining for natural materials like iron, coal or gold which you can craft various objects with. This game is definitely worth the money, so parents, if your kid wants Minecraft I would overall recommend it to you."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 7+,MINECRAFT is a game when there are two modes creative and survival in creative you can create what ever you want and build cool creations in survival you have to survive by crafting ideas chopping wood and building a shelter once it turns dark you can either fight the monsters or run from them rating E10+
"Kid, 12 years old",age 5+,"Minecraft is a awesome game that everyone should try. You can build, or survive, and both are fun. If you don't want to risk spending money on something your kid won't like, have them watch the survive and thrive updated version playlist on YouTube by paulsoaresjr, a family friendly MC youtuber.
Although it's not scary, it can sometimes be a little intense when you are trying to kill a monster. You have to kill animals for resources (all though you could just live on bread, but it's hard).
I said 5+ because usually by 5 kids know stuff isn't real. If your child can tell real life from video games, then they can play this.
You can also just set a difficulty mode to peaceful and/or build in creative mode.
There is almost no violence, no sex, no swearing, no drinking, smoking, or drugs, and unless you do multiplayer or aren't careful with personal info, no need for safety or privacy concerns."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,well i think a mature7 year old could handle the violence because unlike wrestling which makes it look real so people can get quiet violent but in minecraft it doesnt look real as everythings made out of blocks
"Teen, 16 years old",age 6+,
"Kid, 10 years old",age 8+,This for me is a younger version of the popular PC/console version. This is extremely easy to use but recent updates have started to make it online and a tad more violent.
"Kid, 9 years old",age 5+,"It's all pixelated nothing to worry about but now you can buy things that aren't
Worth it 1.99 to change the look don't fall for it!!!"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 9+,"Good game, you can build whatever you want and survive the dangers at night. It may be a little difficult for kids 4-"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 8+,"I really like building lots of stuff in this game. I also love to kill animals, especially baby donkeys, because it's funny to watch them die (no offense to anyone)! What I hate most about it is... one word... ENDERMAN! This monster is terrifying and I try to run away when I see one. Overall good game. It's even good for toddlers, just keep it on Peaceful."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 5+,I think is is a really good game for kids. I Play it and it is very entertaining
"Teen, 15 years old",age 9+,"Although MCPE has less features than its computer counterpart, it's overall wonderful. You can change your skin and name much more easily; for security minded parents, it's a lot harder to get onto a multiplayer server in this version--except if they're using the same wifi as you, which lets siblings have fun together.
It could be a little scary for children, though. I still jump sometimes when a creeper or zombie appears in front of me! One final minor problem is that you can buy skins (appearances) for real money, so if you want to avoid in app purchases, steer clear of this."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 3+,"The game is fine and all but the multiplayer doesn't work , when my friend tried to join my world ( he was at my house) it didn't work. Sometimes Glitches."
"Teen, 15 years old",age 10+,":( well. trolls and swearing in the chat.. everything is too far. sexy skins, swearing in chat, others. Do not even try to make a naked skin or this game will go insane. dont make complaining get worse. well you should learn kids, stay away from the chat ;3;
its also for XBOX"
"Kid, 9 years old",age 5+,"I think Minecraft is an amazing game, where you can learn while you play—physics, survival, food, architecture-learning amazing things in a digital world. My favorite thing is that you can create any world and create endless things to do in it, like a roller coaster, water park, parkour map and much more."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 3+,
"Teen, 13 years old",age 10+,"Minecraft is a delightful game that helps children create things they wouldn't be able to in real life, however, this is a dangerous app to download. I know so many kids my age that suffer from ""addiction"" to Minecraft. One of my friends is so obsessed that his real life is sacrificed, an the intire day is spent playing this game. I did not believe that video games could be addictive, so I tried playing Minecraft. Soon I was spending the day building and surviving in my ""virtual"" world. I began to try to sneak in playing time so often that I surprised myself. I ended up deleting the game. There are just too many possibilities when playing Minecraft. You may not believe that your child will become addicted, but they very well may. PARENTS, PLEASE PREVIEW THE GAME FIRST AND SET PLAYING LIMITS!"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,"It's very fun, &amp; kids can learn how to have patience &amp; solve problems (no water, no food, no house)"
"Teen, 17 years old",age 10+,"it is awesome ,includes math, helps you learn about survival ,and is an amazing game."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 2+,This pocket Edition is not that good I like pc and you cant connect to servers easy.And some times its hard to play.
"Kid, 12 years old",age 2+,"Well, I think that Creative Mode should be played by all ages, while Survival Mode should be played 7+.
I think this because Survival Mode is very violent, and includes zombies, creepers (green men with four legs), endermen (black men with long legs and purple eyes that you have to kill. Also, in Survival Mode, you have to kill animals for food.
Some parents find this natural, others find it disturbing."
"Teen, 17 years old",age 18+,It's cool
"Kid, 10 years old",age 2+,For little kids don't buy if you are 7+ and anybody can join a server.
"Kid, 11 years old",age 8+,"Minecraft is now available for phones and tablets! Minecraft Pocket Edition-- or PE-- is a spinoff of the popular computer/gaming devices game which is slightly slower-- but it is still as good as the normal game. There is some violence in the game-- enemies can go up in smoke, people can set on fire, etc.-- but there is nothing extremely violent or graphic. There is no sex, but there are no boundaries on what you can say in the chat room. As for learning, you can build huge structures which would normally take hours, days, months, or years to construct-- in just a few minutes or hours. All in all, four out of five stars. Good job, Mojang!"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 6+,Extremely similar to the main version though it is portable but less updated.
"Teen, 13 years old",age 5+,This game has no bad language.No bad scenes. Good for 5 and up
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,"People can build, have fun, and play a lot."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,"i played alpha build in a ""demo"" wraper three years ago. Now the game features survival, tons of mobs, breeding (only hearts nothing iffy), the Nether, plenty of new blocks....and you can save worlds. A little updating does no bad. oh if csm gives 8+ for the version with only a few stuff when now there are spiders, skeletons,......"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 10+,"Very fun game for kids ages 10 and up. Make shore before letting your kids play, they understand the cycle of Life and make sure there ok with the killing of animals."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 9+,"I really like to play Minecraft!!! It is fun!!!! The only thing is don't go on a public server because it can get nasty on there, which is why i stopped going on public/local servers. But it is fine if you create a server and go in it with people you trust (meaning your friends or family). Also, sometimes it can a little violent,with bows and arrows and swords, but there isn't too much, and besides all of that it is a great game for age 9 or 8 and older. ** BTW this rating mostly applies to Minecraft PC but some applies to PE**"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 7+,"Everyone that lives in the 20th century has heard of Minecraft. There is a good amount of edicational value, players can learn what different things do, can go mining and build a home. I probably don't have to explain this all, but I will anyways. Minecraft is a block based building game set in a mysterious world like our's. In survival mode you need to get shelter, food (by killing animals) and a weapon to defend against monsters (these can be avoided on Peaceful mode). In creative, you have unlimited building material and can build whatever you imagine. Even though the pocket edition doesn't bring all the features the computer version contained, it is still loads of great fun. Note: Minecraft PE contains a load of ""servers"" players can play on. Some people on these servers have real potty mouths, even if the server has a filter, they can find a loophole (such as @$$ or b!tch). Also, in a new update, players can download ""skins"", and it is easy to say some are skimpy or innopropriate (one is a nude male with detailed pixel art). Parents should be aware you can give personal info out on these servers. One last thing, some ""mods"" that change the game may include guns or other weapons of sort. Not a lot of consumerism included in the game, but a load of Minecraft plushies, toys, books and YouTube videos are based on it."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 6+,"This game is addicting, but its really good. You can build, go creative and go wild with creations. Really fun. Recommend it to anyone 6+.
Its not as good as PC minecraft, but it has pocket edition only features, and whats not in pocket that's in PC will/might get added eventually. Worth the money, great game.
Warning: this game is addictive."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,This is a great sandbox learning game where you can build anything you want. But in the night zombies and other monsters come out. But they do not look scary. A worthy buy from the app store
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,"I think this game is very good and recommend it, but... This game is VERY ADDICTIVE it is super addictive so if you want your children to play one hour a day you have to trust them to put it down when their time is up. Otherwise it is a very good game."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 3+,I think this is a great game to use your creativity. But you should be at least 3 so you can actually change blocks and build struck tiers.
"Kid, 8 years old",age 8+,"i think minecraft is a educational but its a bit wierd how you can chat
online to other people and have zombies,creepers+skeletons and
spiders,endernenor zombie pigmen .i have a lot of questions here i will give you an example why do skeletons wear gold armor or how about how do endermen teleport
i dont know this one its realy hard to figure out how much blocks to dig until the earth ends"
"Teen, 17 years old",age 7+,Not as good as computer but it doesn't play as big part in online gaming which separates the inappropriate factor in the computer version of minecraft do to adults playing online. It has some of the same stuff as the computer version but easier for younger kids to play.
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,"I play PC and PE but PE is probably the easiest to control and best to actually play on, but, PC is way too complicated and the whole End and Nether is not even educational! It's just a survial-builder game! The only thing I do on MC PC is just find server ip's and play servers! So yeah any 6+ kids who wants a fun surival creative builder game just download Minecraft PE! It's all worth it for price! Plus new update March 16th so yay!"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 6+,"It's a pretty good game and I would also reccomend the PC version. This game includes building and survival skills that your child will need in the future. It is not advanced, but it is great for ages 6+"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 8+,"It's okay but Beware Involves Zombies,Exploding Beast,and Skeletons with Bow and Arrows,it's not that fun though with like half the things missing from The Xbox version on It."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft: Pocket Edition is fun, but it can be addicting. It doesn't have all the features of PC Minecraft, but it's still pretty fun. They'll add all the features eventually."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 5+,"Minecraft Pocket Edition is the Mobile version Of Minecraft It teaches Children to be creative and is suitable for all in creative mode however survival mode has sight of monsters and spiders you can fight them with swords however this is not graphic it's blocky and they turn red (Not Blood) it's a punch effect and the fall over however this is not graphic it's rather comic and extremely unrealistic as there made with blocks but survival does teach lessens of using you resources over all it's a great kids game and is not to violent and very appealing another issue is not violence or any other content but ease of play for very young children it's hard to move, around, fly or see (Because Of Camera Angles) But You will learn In the end so I say creative - 2 Survival - 6 minecraft pe - 6+"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 6+,
"Kid, 9 years old",age 5+,"It's a great game with the new update that now you can sleep in creative. It's way past alpha stage so those photos in the front are out-dated. Now you can use any block in creative, and you can have dogs, villagers, creepers, endermen, and all the other mobs in the game. Also the new update adds villages that have random chests for THE FIRST TIME IN POCKET EDITION. The new update adds a bunch of stuff like caves, dungeons with spawners and chests with them, and abandoned mineshafts. So it's a really good game for all ages and I love it."
"Kid, 7 years old",age 5+,You could learn how to protect yourself and how to build your mine. My favorite part about Minecraft is the building. I like to build statues.
"Kid, 11 years old",age 7+,"It's a really great way to build, and farm to get resources and to survive. I really love the game and I play it lots. There are 2 different game modes; 'survival' (you have 10 lives and you have to hunt to get food eg: pork, beef, chicken, wheat)... 'creative' (you have infinite resources and you can fly and the only way to die is to dig straight down past bedrock ; you fall in to the void!!!"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,Give it time...
"Kid, 12 years old",age 7+,"Hello, Epicboy21, yet again. This game is yet again, basically a spin-off of the original Minecraft, adapted for PC, then ported to PlayStation 3 and XBOX 360 --- (that said, I've never actually played the console versions --- either the console versions --- of this game) --- which is still, mildly violent, hence Apple themselves, rating this ""9+"", for the following: ""Infrequent/mild fantasy violence --- Infrequent/mild horror/fear themes"" Sure the zombies in Survival Mode may be a little scarily creepy, and yes, any enemies turn red once hit, and disappear into puffs of cloud and into the ground, dead bodies covered in red, Apple is right. It is, however, good to know, that, your livestock and animals can be hurt as well: example, I think once, in Survival Mode, I saw some zombie trying to eat one of my cows --- however, the animal violence extends to, unfortunately, that your livestock can be set on fire, and that your livestock, just like the zombies, when attacked, turn red, however, it blinks red, and the animals whine --- this will upset animal lovers, however, it's completely optional, not compulsory at all, so I just tried it once to see what it did --- I'm one of those animal lovers --- but it's no worse than Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory trying to get a chicken decapitated on-screen and have several chicken heads flying around in the air: however, the other violence is that, you can hit humans, and some text chats are unmoderated, some are, you've just gotta be careful, and, it's pretty easy to play, once you pick it up --- there's no sex, swearing, drug-use, drug- references, sexual themes, or anything of that kind --- which is perfect, for kids, but online sculptures (and yours) may be able to spell swear-words: once, online, this kid made a sign that said ""F***ING GRIEFED B****"" (except that it was completely uncensored). So be careful online again, as players may be mean enough to bury you. Anyway, please buy, as the premium version is better, and, anyway, thankyou for reading."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 2+,"It's fun to build and destroy stuff but it's pointless. This game has no objective, story, or dialog. Overall, it's a fun game, but if you play it too much it will make you dumb."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 8+,"My profile: https://www.commonsensemedia.org/users/epic-waffles
This is a good Minecraft mobile remake that is just has different controls that you might have to get used to. Good game. Just some violence."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,"This is my first review.This game is good for people who want to build,fight monsters,or explore the world and dont have a computer,cant play on computer,wanna pay less,or just wanna get minecraft on the phone.There are two modes survival and creative.In survival at the start you have nothing and there are easy,normal,hard,and peaceful modes.The thing to do first is to punch a tree and craft wooden planks.Then you build a house and make a crafting table.Then you craft tools and go mining,start a farm,or kill mobs.You also need a bed so you have to kill a sheep.You can do anything you want.At night monsters will spawn.You have to fight monsters but you can change the mode to peaceful so monsters wont spawn.
There is another mode called creative.You wont get attacked by monsters and you have every block in minecraft.You dont need to eat and the only way to die is to go to The Void(the bottom of the world).You can bulid anything you want and spawn any mob.This mode is best for people that just wanna build.You might wanna see the minecraft wiki before buying this app.There are are less stuff than pc minecraft.There is also violence.You need to kill cows,pigs,and chickens for food and sheep for wool but you can shear sheep.You also need to fight monsters.There are also wolves but they only attack when you hit them.You tame them with bones.You get bones from skeletons.When you tame them they will fight for you but they will die is they loose too muck health.To heal them give the dog meat.You can also breed mobs.When you feed the two animals they will start to kiss then a baby will spawn.Go to the minecraft wiki to learn what to feed them.There is also The Nether and The End.I think this game is good for ages 7 and up and is a little bit good for learning.I like this game alot.This game is pause for ages under 7 but might be bad for older kids.That is the end of this review."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 2+,"its a great app, but the review is wrong. minecraft PE came first. Thats why it has some exclusive stuff."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 8+,I think if YOU parents have kids and there 7 and under you should not let them play minecraft. 8 and up could play minecraft
"Kid, 10 years old",age 5+,The real Minecraft is better because it has more stuff.
"Kid, 10 years old",age 4+,
"Teen, 15 years old",age 4+,"Minecraft PE is an ok building game that has little to no violence. You can play one of two game modes: Creative and Survival. In creative mode you can not die and build anything you want from an unlimited supply of blocks. Neat-o. Nothing mature here. Then there's survival mode. In this mode you must collect recourses to build your shelter and must survive monsters in the night. The monsters are more comical due to their blocky textures and include pretty bizarre characters (you have your usual skeletons, zombies, and spiders but also have unique character such as creepers [creatures that blow themselves up] and endermen [a tall monster that can teleport around the map]). You can kill these creatures with swords/bow and arrows, but there is no blood (they only jump back from hits) and disappear instantly when they become deceased. If you play in the multiplayer mode, you can kill human characters, but they have the same mild death animation. I would allow a four year old to play creative mode, but I would recommend survival mode only for kids aged six and up due to some mild violence"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 2+,"I think Minecraft is a wonderful game that is appropriate for everyone. I don't understand why people are saying that violence is an issue. Sure, you can kill other things and if you're on survival mode you can get killed, but there's no blood involved. As for safety, you can only join games if you are in the same Wi-Fi range, so its not an issue. Even though the game doesn't come with any instructions, most people can figure it out pretty easily. Overall, I think its a fun game for all ages."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,GREAT untill update now it crashes every 5 min. really I did a test on it. Bad creepers are bad there not smart AT ALL.
"Kid, 9 years old",age 8+,"I thought this game sucked until I played it more. Then I was even more good
than I am on the computer! I put privacy only for one reason: Players have
nothing when they join your game. So you could disconnect, or have some
fun and chase the player(s). This is pretty educational. For example: They're
are Diamonds. Not crazy ruby junk thats like magical. So I say this a decent
game. Oh and it might be a bit scary. Only because some zombies have snuck up on me. Including 2 creepers (1 i saw the other i did not). But yep,
this game is awesome!"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,"It is fun and cartoony, it is great for kids. It helps kids use their imagination and get creative, get friends, and learn survival. The bad side is ""trolling"", they are people who destroy other people's homes online, steal their stuff, make people get angry or rage, or they like to hurt other people online. Those people always tries to find someone to bully. But good news is that you can make traps in your game, or chat, or craft, and team up. Some cursing is involved in the game which influence kids of trolling or cursing I recommend 7-9 year old kids to be supervised and 10+ year olds to be free, but if they are playing more often than learning, you should restrict them from Minecraft temporarily at times. They may have an addiction because minecraft is an addicting game, if they are addicted they won't concentrate in school and they start changing."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 5+,"Minecraft pocket edition is basically the same thing as the PC version. However, I find it is easier to understand. The crafting is a lot easier in pocket edition. They recently updated it so you can spawn animals in creative which made it better and you can make large chests by putting two regular ones side by side. It is a great game that I would recommend to children of pretty much all ages. The only thing is it can be hard to get around at times and sometimes the controllers are complicated."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft: Pocket Edition is a disappointing app version of the PC, Mac and Linux Classic sandbox game, Minecraft.
Although users may not have access to online servers, so there is no worries about privacy or swearing, the single-player gameplay is extremely disappointing."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 5+,It is a good game. the monster mode I am worried about one time i saw a zomibe in the window and i didn't want to come out.
"Kid, 9 years old",age 5+,"MINECRAFT IS THE BEST GAME EVER! It isn't violent except from the fact that there are monsters that you have to fight. You can turn monsters off though so you can't die and there are no monsters. You can go mining too and collect loads of different things like diamonds and coal and iron and redstone and gold and stuff and emeralds but you can't get emeralds on Pocket Edition. (Which is annoying!) But it's quite complicated so anybody under 5 or 6 couldn't play it!
But either way, BUY IT!
Plus my minecraft name is Dawn"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 3+,"It's a great app! It's perfect for people who want to build their own structures and towns. The only problem is it's addicting. My whole family plays and loves it! But don't get me wrong, it's a fantastic app perfect for all ages."
"Kid, 8 years old",age 3+,I love this game there is almost no violence you kill zombies creepers skelatens endermen and more. language is a bad thing only on servers and you tube vids. On servers there is no cecerd bad words they can say all bad words and you tubers say bad words. But it is a good game get it for a kid by.
"Kid, 11 years old",age 7+,"All time, double-favorite app since 2012. You can use swords to kill monsters such a creepers before they explode. Endermen can teleport and have really good eyesight. My point is, this is an educational app that teaches kids to be creative and gather material to make whatever they want! A hotel, a cruise, a treehouse, you name it, it can be built! Plus the nether, which I like to call Hell. You can destroy Zombie Pigmen, which is a bit inappropriate for very young kids. Just be careful not to fall into the lava, or you'll lose all your weapons and potions!"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 7+,"Minecraft PE is a very inspiring app, and is great for little builders. It encourages an engineering mindset, but does have some violence. To restore your health, you kill animals, and during night get attacked by monsters. When you kill something it blinks red, then dies: a non graphic form of violence."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 4+,"Minecraft Pocket Edition is perfect! Pretty much it's perfect here's why.
. Doesn't need Internet so perfect for traveling
. Lets your creativity come out
. If you don't want to battle off creepers, zombies, skeletons, ect... You can put it on peaceful mode!
. It's pocket edition.. Those two words speak for itself. You can play as long as you have your iPad,iPhone, or iPod Touch!
Three reasons proving my point of why Minecraft is almost perfect the only thing is the price... But eventually I believe it's worth it!!!!"
"Teen, 13 years old",age 8+,"Great Game! Now at version 0.7.2 on iphone, ipod, and ipad. Android is at 0.7.1. Good for any age, though childern under 5 may be a little spooked by the zombies noises and the You Died! messages. Overall though this is a great game"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 6+,"I play the lite version of Minecraft. It's super fun! I like games like these with Creativity involved ^.^ It's super popular, too!"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 8+,Amazing game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! One of the best apps ever. It is slightly violent.
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,"I just bought this yesterday. I have to admit that the price is a little bit high. $6.99 for a game?! Still, I reccomend this game to anyone who is creative. I LOVE this!"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 7+,"I Wanted To Try Out Minecraft Because EVERYONE At My School Was Talking About It.(Well,Maybe Not Everyone,But You Get The Idea.) So I Got And Tryed It Out.Well,For The First Like Couple Of Days,I Didn't Know How To Craft,Or Turn On Non-Peaceful Mode.I Ended Up Calling My Friend And Asking Him,But Over The Phone I Couldn't Understand.But Then I Learned How Turn Non- Peaceful Mode, Fight Creepers,Zombies,And More.Minecraft Is Fun,But Only At Night.At Night,That's When The Creepers,Zombies,Spiders,And Skeletons Come Out.Your Object Is To Survive By Killing Them And Stuff.That's Fun.But In The Daytime,You Can Build,Craft,And Kill Animals.(At Least,That's What I Know How To Do.)I Don't Think Building,Crafting And Killing Chicken,Cows,And Sheep Are Fun.Maybe I Just Don't Know How To Play,But To Me,Minecraft Is Only Fun At Night.(But If I Know How To Play It Better,And Get Some Tips,I Might Change My Mind.)
UPDATE 6/28/2013
I Have Been Meaning To Update This Review For A Long Time.I Now Know How To Craft Mine And More.I Have A House And Have Started Digging To Find Diamonds In One Of My Worlds.With Help From Online And Practice,I Now Know How Too Do All That Stuff
I Changed My Stars From Three Too Five.
Update:7/4/13:I Changed It Back Too 3/5 Stars.
Update:10/13/13-BACK TO FIVE STARS!"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 6+,"Great for young kids, however, a ghostly character ""Herobrine"" (Default Steveskin with glowing white eyes) is in this version of the game (Alpha). He makes various scary things such as buildings and ""Herobrine Animals"" happen in your world before officially making his appearance, killing you, and screwing up all the stuff you made. The drama leading up to his appearance may be too scary for some kids."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 8+,"Why I said that, exactly? This game has some up's and so-so's. First, the nether block was added, the minecraft game is getting engaging and strong on focus (like, I didn't say it but luck). The bottom line most likely, you have to see this app yourself. It still didn't have TNT lighting (flint and steel) on creative mode. See this game yourself if you want. Creepers, Skeletons, Spiders, and Zombies are added and will start to kill you in every luck they have (it depends) and you kill them with either a sword, or a bow. Plus, you have armor now, it takes a lot of mining in order to wear full armor. Good creations, some violence, to be warned."
"Kid, 12 years old",age 10+,"I personally think this game is better for kids than the PC version. Mostly because their isn't as much online activity and they can't connect with potentially dangerous people unless they are in the same space as someone else playing it. This gamee promotes creativy and is just plain fun. There is pretty much no violence unless you count hitting creatures with swords and the screen saying 'you died' as violence. Buy this game, I just got the newest update and it's getting better and better!"
"Teen, 14 years old",age 6+,"Not much for learning, but a fun sandbox game. Safety is no concern."
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,"I love Minecraft! It was 7.00 $, but it was totally worth it! I play it every day and it is so addicting. I can build anything I want in creative or collect and discover in Survival. All of my friends play and we play together. I have built gold and diamond houses, resturants and more. You can even enter a seed to make your world unique. I love Minecraft!"
"Kid, 9 years old",age 7+,"It is okay. It could definitely be a lot more like the computer version and the creative mode is better than survival. I hope that they release a new update that lets you craft, smelt, use chests, and have materials. It would be nice if there was a survival inventory in creative and there was a night so that you can sleep. I wanted to make a survival server and I couldn't do it in creative cause you can't switch modes.That kind of sucks:(. Kind of okay but it isn't compatible with 2g of any devices except maybe Ipad. I have it on my Iphone and Ipad. Okay, but could definitely be improved. (my rating just means for now.)"
"Kid, 8 years old",age 6+,"If I Were YOu,Id wait 'til This Game Gets To Beta Update 1.3 Or Atleast When the endermen Gets released ;)Otherwise,It Is A FRee World But Id Rather Not"
"Kid, 11 years old",age 5+,"This game is where you build buildings and protect yourself from monsters. Nothing is graphic, and everything is pixels. Besides monsters attacking you, nothing is bad."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 11+,"Three stars? THREE STARS?!?!? Minecraft PE is an amazing game. I always use it to post my designs and castles on Instagram. Very rewarding. Lots of followers. But thats not the point. Minecraft PE is a great game if you know how to use it. The split touch controls are ridiculously hard, so remember to change that in settings before playing. But overall, Minecraft PE is a wonderful addition to the computer game (if not more addicting)"
"Kid, 10 years old",age 6+,"Pocket Edition, not for me! This game stinks in my opinion. The computer version is way better and honestly I wouldn't have ever bought this game if I knew how bad it was. In my opinion, maybe not yours, I would NOT buy this game."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 6+,"Its getting MUCH BETTER!!! they are adding so much, this review is so out f date it makes me mad that its still on the site!!!! its a decent game now, and its getting better. update this review."
"Kid, 9 years old",age 6+,has one mob in it and has liimits to other items if its free to ruien a good game
"Teen, 14 years old",age 7+,"Wow. Just wow. Common Sense, THIS GAME IS IN ALPHA! Give it time. They have already added classic pc minecraft stuff. Like crafting, swords, picaxes, and animals. The review by common sense is outdated. Parents, this game is worth $7.00. I thought is was a rip off at first, but every new update makes this game better and better. Nothing too worry about."
"Teen, 13 years old",age 4+,"A quite popular gem on the app store/google play for basically any age. It's gameplay is not like the PC version we all know and love, yet. It has been progressing quickly though and it's only in 0.3.2 alpha and already has tools, zombies, survival mode and DIAMONDS!!! Really worth £5"
"Kid, 12 years old",age 2+,"It's a abhorrent try by Mojang, though a excellent idea, I think it needs improvment. ALOT of improvement. Unlike it's PC counterpart this game has limits to the map and to creativity."
"Teen, 15 years old",age 6+,"Minecraft: Pocket Edition is an app which you can download on your iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad and Android. It is definitely not as good as the one which is played on computer (however updates are coming out with more mobs, blocks etc). A so-so game for kids and teens."
"Kid, 11 years old",age 4+,"Give it a little time CommonSense, the game is in alpha and receiving heavy updates. Soon this WILL be minecraft singleplayer for the iphone, tablet etc...
But, Come on. DON'T post a review yet -_-
Not to mention, I'd still give it a 3 star, and I haven't even played it. But i've seen footage.
Good day."
