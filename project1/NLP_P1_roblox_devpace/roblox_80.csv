"age 7+","There are pros and cons to this site. First of all, if you're thinking since it downloads software it downloads malware, you're wrong. It's a safe download, and if you have any trouble downloading there's plenty of help to be found. As for the benefits of this site, it's a very good learning experience for your children. They learn about business and buying/selling, they learn how to create games with the easy to find and very detailed game creation tutorials and scripting tutorials, putting them on the path to learning programming languages (The one used in this site is called ROBLOX Lua, it's excellent), and they learn about how to keep and stick to a budget. There's the option to upgrade your account to Builder's Club, and there are plenty of features to be used with this. However, the site also has some flaws. It's very easy for younger children to end up on phishing sites from bot-accounts made by the owners of those sites. Before allowing your child to make an account, make sure they are aware of web-safety and how to keep their account from being stolen. If your child is educated on web safety (Which they should be educated on before being allowed to browse the internet), there are no concerns.","Adult"
"age 7+","I know what your thinking... WHY 7!!!!! I tell you why now.. Ok yes.. There is some killing.. And in some games its like blood... But the blood is transparent red sqaures.. And deaths are just your person falling apart... Its like sliding de-attatched legos across a floor... But there is LOTS of game that arent inappropriate... Such as the Hide and seek in a giant house, Obstacle corses, Roleplaying, And building games... See? I think roblox isnt that bad.. Its just like LEGOS!!!","Parent of a 9-year-old"
"age 6+","My daughter plays ROBLOX all the time. I decided, as her parent to look into it. I found that it is free unless you want a membership. If your child is interested in programming, then you have hit the jackpot. IN this game, you can create games for others to play and play games others created. I highly recommend you have your child play ROBLOX","Parent of a 9-year-old"
"age 6+","i love roblox i have obc and it is fine and good to play","Adult"
"age 12+","ROBLOX is a very educational game and inspires kids to learn. Moderators do a good job of monitoring the site and generally keep it safe. Violence is frequently seen in games, considering that this is the type of audience that the game caters to. Privacy is only an issue if kids are not taught to be safe. In many instances, people have complained that their kids are not safe because users try to get personal information from people. Although this does not often happened, and is exaggerated by parents, the fact may be their fault because they are leaving their kids uneducated; this is probably the main reason that privacy is an issue. Another complaint that many parents had was the online dating factor. The site does NOT support online dating, and will take moderation actions on kids that pretend to have ""girlfriends"" or ""boyfriends."" Language is not an issue at all. In game chat filters, as well as over the website, there are filters that filter any language besides the minor ""hell"" that players might try to shout out. Disguising of language to try to bypass filters is looked for by moderators, and is most always found and punished. The final issue is consumerism. This is probably the most major issue on Roblox. There are MANY ads that link to different companies which are place in banners and rectangles all over the site. Parents should know that users can also create their own ads to solicit items that they have created which feature images and captions (which are both moderated). Also, ROBLOX has recently been showing video ads for different companies before users enter a place (these companies are generally ones such as insurance, phone carriers, car companies, and etc. that advertise).
Although Roblox does have its flaws, it is mostly a friendly game that encourages children to build and program. Issues are only minor issues that can be found in a game as friendly as Disney's Club Penguin, but are over-exaggerated often. ROBLOX is probably best for kids in their early teens and up.","Adult"
"age 8+","My child has played Roblox for 3 years now. And it's very easy to tell that you guys took one look at it and decided to write a scathing, lying review.
1. Do not blame Roblox for the games YOUR CHILD decided to play. If your child plays a game and you don't like it, don't let them play it. Don't blame Roblox for a violent game.
2. Do not blame Roblox for players that are rude. THEY'RE the people
that should be reported. Not Roblox.
3. The chat filter is working and if anything, it works a little TOO good. And don't say people curse with numbers because they block numbers too.
4. Many games on Roblox have good messages. Such as Piggy, a game that encourages teamwork while you gather keys and certain items to escape the piggy. Or Welcome To Bloxburg, a game that shows what it's like to be an adult with a job and bills.
5. Roblox does NOT ask for money. THE GAMES do. If your child plays a game that is plastered full of game passes and in-game items, of course, they will want them. So simply don't let them play them!!
6. Yes, there are bullies on Roblox. But there's a little something called LEAVING THE GAME or BLOCKING THE PLAYER that you could do instead of blaming Roblox.
7. Roblox is not an addicting game, my child has never had any problems managing his time on Roblox.
8. And if Roblox just isn't the game for your child, DONT BLAME ROBLOX FOR THE FACT THAT YOUR CHILD DOSENT LIKE IT!!!
9. If you get scared your child is going to encounter a child predator, dont worry, words such as ""where do you live"" or ""whats your number"" and Numbers themselves all turn into ""###############"" . Also, its super rare for something like this to happen, anyway.
10. The violence in roblox ISNT EVEN ACTUAL VIOLENCE. There is no blood, no gore, just your character falling into pieces like lego characters.
11. There are settings you can change for both account safety and account privacy, one of them can restrict your child's ability to use the in-game chat feature, but that defeats half the purpose of roblox, i suggest only using this if your child has a real encounter with a child predator, creepy person, or your child is very young, like 4 or 5 years old.
12. And let me say this up front. YOU. NEED. TO. WATCH. WHAT. YOUR. CHILD. IS. DOING. Simple as that.
13. Roblox is USER GENERATED, meaning that most of the stuff that's on the platfrom is made by people who play roblox, not roblox itself. So Roblox isnt to blame for games with cartoon violence or iffy stuff in the slightest. Roblox tries very very hard to moderate their content and karens tend to not care.
Thank you for reading and I hope you found this educational.","Adult"
"age 8+","I would recomend to kid odler then 8 but my 5 year old stepsister plays it with no consern. Roblox gives a chance for kid to grow and devolpe in a creative envierment; it is a great game for kids to play, explore, learn, and advance in this way I would highly recomend Roblox to anyone.","Parent of a 5-year-old"
"age 6+","ROBLOX is a very good game, if you know what you're doing. I recommend, if your child is too young to know most right from wrong, then monitor the child's account. If a user's account is detected to be under the age of 13, ROBLOX automatically filters words such as ""idiot"", ""crap"", etc. (I think) to make it safer for the younger audience. Also, in the settings, you can change who can message the child, who can chat with the child, etc. If you truly know what you are doing, and you are willing to monitor your child's activities, then ROBLOX is a great game for them to open up their imagination. I suggest, if you want to make sure your child isn't playing games that they shouldn't be, e.g. shooter games, robbery games, etc. then every so often, just for a few minutes, go on their account, and on the home page you can see their ""Recently Played"" games. To see all recently played games, you can click the button to the right of that title that says ""See All"".
Overall, I believe ROBLOX is a great game for children to play, as long as they are mature enough to know right from wrong. And if they are younger, then I'd say it's still good for them to play too, as long as you are monitoring their activity on it, and you make sure they know not to play games that you wouldn't approve of, and you can in the settings change who they are aloud to interact with.
Also, a side note, ROBLOX has a parent page here: https://corp.roblox.com/parents/
I highly recommend reading it, as it tells you lots of important information.","Adult"

My daughter loves it.","Adult"
"age 10+","Yes, Roblox can be a money suck. Yes, Roblox is an online game with player content. Obviously this is going to lead to some more adult themes, but honestly people. I’m eighteen, and not afraid to admit that I’ve been a player since I was around 13 or so. Roblox can teach people to code, it can be a early way for young coders to make money, but even beyond that, the majority of the roblox community is made up of wonderful people. I’ve a lot of online friends (with none of which I ever had a desire to share private details with as a 13 year old or otherwise) that I met on Roblox. And they’ve been nothing but supportive friends, like my own anonymous family. I used to play things like simulators or obbies (a parkour game) and eventually found that a lot of creators make games for role playing in their favorite movie/book/game universes. Most of these roleplay games are not intended for children (depending on what they’re based off of or set in) but have been the reason I found my love and talent for writing. If your child at least has the common sense of a hamster, they won’t exchange private info with random players, not that roblox’s smart censoring systems even allow them to. Some of you say that it doesn’t matter, that they still see adult content. It’s a user run platform. Obviously discretion is advised, as not absolutely everything is going to be contained. Alternatively, you can disable their ability to see or send messages to/from other players and restrict their available games to official roblox created games. I mean come on. What decent parent would allow their children to play some of the few shooters on the platform in the first place? My parents didn’t. Roblox is a safe community made mostly up of great people, which, by nature, is going to have at least a few exploiters and jerks wandering around. Lastly, I see some of you advising people to simply purchase Minecraft for upwards of 25 dollars as an alternative. Need I really remind you that Minecraft has an entire user based game mode dedicated to playing online with strangers that has little to NO CENSORSHIP at all? The four swears Minecraft Multiplayer will censor (IF the server’s creator added such a function) won’t stop your children from exchanging their real names, or their addresses, or prevent one person from calling them stupid. And if your advice was meant in reference of the single player aspect of Minecraft, why did you even bother to allow your kids who have the self directory of a potato to play online user based games at all?","Adult"
"age 7+","ROBLOX Is a awesome gaming website for kids 7 and up.","Adult"
"age 7+","Trust me, I play the game myself and I really enjoy it.
Violence: I will agree, there is some games with guns and knives as well as horror/first person shooter games but they aren't bad, there's no blood or gore and it isn't even all that violent, if you want your kids to not play games involving guns or even weapons, there is plenty other games out there.
Sex: In all of my years of playing this game I have never seen anything worse than one idiot saying ""your mom's gay"" but everybody ignored him, and yes I have played the hospital game that CSM was talking about, and I never ran into anything bad.
Language: actually yes, just about everybody swears and words like ""damn and hell"" aren't censored but everything else is just a bunch of hashtags.
Illegal things: There are some games out there that focus on being criminals but are nothing more than cops vs. Robbers. No drugs, alcohol, or tobacco either.
How good is it: Some of the games are actually Very well made and very well done. I highly recommend you play it on a computer or Xbox though as the mobile version often crashes due to big some games are.
The Games To Play: My favorite games are the following and are all free: Prisoners Life, Work at a pizza place, hide and seek extreme, siren head, and just about any tycoon game.
OVERALL: I would let anyone 7 and up play it and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!","Adult"
"age 9+","ROBLOX is a game that my children love very much. I have a 10 and 12 year old who have been playing for years. I think that the building is a great way for kids to use there imagination, but on the other hand people say really disturbing terms in the chat, I understand that its life and that I have preteens and I should let them do what they think is right at this age but I really think that what people are saying is not good, well for any age! For example, my 12 year old was left logged in and I saw some things under the recently played section and there was games like ""kiss a cute lady"" and that triggered me okay. They already learned about the birds and the bees at school, but I will NOT let a silly game tell them about it because the information is inaccurate and rude. The pros about the game is that parents can set privacy like to block certain words that are rude, and our kids can play good games on there like ""adopt and raise a cute kid"" that is fine and there is other good games.","Adult"
"age 2+","ITS GOOD :D","Adult"
"age 16+","Did any of you actually play the games with your children. The Violence in many of the games is really not appropriate. The Social connections are linking kids to ""Strangers- Pedophiles"" who are grooming them and talking very inappropriately to them. I sat down and played the game with my nephew that was when we chose a weapon and killed the other players. Not a great message for a 7 year old, I do not recommend this site. If anything turn off network connections.","Adult"
"age 6+","im tired of people saying the game is bad.
its an amazing game, if you karens cant handle lego characters falling into pieces, then dont play it.
if you ever encounter a bully, theyre just some little kids taking their rage out on you. just block them
worried about the chat feature? turn it off in settings.
there. your child is set for a safe and fun ROBLOX experience","Adult"
"age 8+","I am a 19 year old security engineer and game engineer and I have been perusing reviews about this game. Many individuals are expressing with respect to it being ""excessively sexual"" and that ROBLOX should be doing something to take care of that. All things considered, they have endeavored to actualise a filter, yes it very well may be skirted and individuals will dependably discover workarounds paying little heed to whatever you do.
With respect to the way that individuals think they are not taking care of the unlawful movement and what not that is led through this application. It's not by any means extremely simple to police a whole network with a large number of dynamic clients currently is it? No, it's certainly feasible but rather it's far-fetched that it would occur. I admire this platform and truly, similar to some other game, the equivalent occurs in Minecraft servers. You will get individuals who are sexual, pedophiles e.t.c on any online platform, not simply ROBLOX.
The way that kids are being presented to illegal acts is definitely not something good , not that I at any point said it was. Anyway I am expressing this is simply being finished by another person with noxious purpose who is obviously making a decent attempt to be entertaining, lethal or evidently attempting to cause devastation. Indeed something that occurs in all platforms.
Since I have been on platforms for example, Steam, I can comprehend the harmfulness that is included with networks and how it could effect individuals. I can comprehend in this circumstance that these acts will have contrary ramifications on kids inside, anyway I don't by and by like the way that individuals guarantee ""ROBLOX IS doing nothing about it"" there's just next to no they can do. In case you're a developer, you may comprehend that there's sure restrictions here.
At any rate, to the central matter. I totally love ROBLOX itself as a platform. It enables me to be uncover my imaginative personality, simple to pick up programming and even opens up profession openings. As somebody who is making over £10,000 off of ROBLOX I can state myself that it can have constructive advantages benefits me massively. My survey generally speaking is that ROBLOX is a splendid platform with an equalisation of pessimism and positivity inside their locale, much the same as most different platforms!","Adult"
"age 9+","Now I don't know what other parents are thinking, saying, and I quote ""Roblox is not for kids"". Here are some reasons it's a great experience for kids!
1. Roblox is free, apart from the UNNECESSARY purchases to customize your character.
2. There are tons of games for your kids to enjoy.
3. Your child can learn coding and more programming and building his own game.
Now let's be honest, they're are a few violent games, but your character always dies with the same screen: A flash of red and then he explodes into BLOCKS, THAT'S RIGHT, BLOCKS. I guess if you find a game you don't want them playing just tell them, the only other problem is the consumerism, but let's be honest, they can just get a Roblox or iTunes or whatever store gift card and buy some robux with THEIR OWN money, again, it's not a big deal.
DON'T LISTEN TO PARENTS SAYING IT'S ""Horrible"" and ""Not for kids'. This game is perfectly safe and fun!","Adult"
"age 8+","It's safe ok. People will say it isn't because they can't parent. Dont want them playing bad games? Tell them not too. If they are being bullied, block that player. Roblox censors bad and inappropriate words which can be bypassed but still. Again, if people are online dating, switch servers or block OR ignore them. Roblox is safe dont listen to people saying it's not safe or Its terrible.","Adult"
"age 18+","","Adult"
"age 8+","Ok, so I am here to clear some things up, because clearly there has been a lot of confusion. So ROBLOX is a very age appropriate game! All the inappropriate stuff is blocked out or reported instantly. ROBLOX has a very good moderation system and most ROBLOX games are appropriate! If you want some games that I can promise you are ok for kids are: Piggy: Piggy is a great game that is not violent at all! I mean sure you get hit with bats but really? Is it really that violent? Arsenal: Ok it is not violent at all! just because it has to do with guns does not mean its violent! Blockate: Blockate is a very good game and does encourages creativity building there own builds! The Blockate team has a bunch of moderators! And have you heard about ROBLOX getting sued? Well they got sued for a dumb reason. So this idiot girl spent 1000 real life dollars on robux because her idiot parents let her have their crdit card number then the idiot parents sued ROBLOX blaming them even though it was their daughters fault. People can be so stupid sometimes. But ROBLOX is a amazing game!","Adult"
"age 14+","My 16 year old daughter goes on this site. She plays “normal” content and I thought it was a safe kids site. So I allowed my 5 year old son to play. All of a sudden I hear swears coming from the computer and I ask my daughter what is up with Roblox. She tells me there is a lot of mature content too. So, I created an account for my son in a restricted mode. Yet, he still has access to violent games all about murdering and torture. I restricted even further and turned off communications but the next time he logged in, it’s as if I hadn’t even blocked anything. I wasn’t aware until he had already played the games for a bit. Now all he talks about is Jeff the Killer, Slenderman, Granny, Piggy, etc. it was my fault for trusting the “security” features. This website is terrible.","Adult"
"age 7+","I purchased Robux for the Adopt Me game for my 10 year old daughter. As soon as she spent the money, every single thing she had vanished. Every pet, everything she had just bought with the money I just put on for her, her fly portion, ride potion, everything. She was absolutely devastated!!! I contacted Robux, who said they do not replace anything. I thought she got hacked at 1st. Now, based on their response, I think they are a scam and they took it all away as soon as we spent money on it, hoping it would force us to re-buy what she lost.","Adult"
"age 15+","My kids requested to download this app and when reviewing I noticed that this app is a portal to a majority of the stuff I have blocked from their devices.

"age 7+","Sorry for any grammar or spelling errors, I do not know much english. My 3 children love playing Roblox after school and on weekends. I myself have tried this platform a few times and created my first account in 2015. You can create models or games, and also play some games you are interested in. Default keyboard controls are easy as long as you know how to use one or play video games with one. Some youtubers base their content on roblox. Many in-game items such as gamepasses, clothes and accessories for your character can only be purchased with the game currency called Robux, which can only be earned by purchasing with real life currency. Players can also chat with people in games, and privately chat with people they add as friends, or followers or just anyone if settings are changed.
I think that not the entire platform is terrible, just some part of the community that makes it look bad today. I’ve seen my kids get harassed online what seems like many times. I myself have also experienced being surrounded by hedgehog hair emo looking legos with fat legs, and very tall ones aswell. But I know that things that are violent in real life such as deaths and fighting are not seen to be violent in Roblox. Deaths are just your character’s body parts dismembering. Not really bloody unless scripted to be violent in a game, which is possible.
The good things I have seen from playing roblox is that you can do many creative and fun things, and that kids can learn from Roblox and enjoy participating in seasonal events and just playing games in general.
Some bad stuff i have seen from roblox is that people can make and use bypassed/inappropriate audios, models and decals (images) by going to the library section of roblox, which has all the decals, audios and models and can either get one and add it to their games or use them in games made by others if possible, or create them ( i don’t know how). And that Roblox’s moderation is not really that neat and offensive or rude phrases, slurs or cuss words can be bypassed by replacing some letters with numbers or symbols, or with another letter that would make the word sound the same as it’s original way of being spelled. Inappropriate sentences, phrases or words can be sensored with the “#” symbol. But sometimes the chat filter gets confused and can sensor a sentence or word that is completely child friendly and isnt rude or offensive at all. Bypassed phrases can get sensored too, but sometimes will not.
Another thing i heard is that scam bots, or roblox accounts that are made for spamming can post links onto comment sections of items or into chats. And those links can lead to scam sites or websites that can grab your personal information. Some promoting free currency (mainly robux), free limited items (accessories or faces that cost a bunch of robux and are labeled as “limited”) or certain items from popular games. These ads can trick players, especially small children, into clicking links and possibly falling for scams or getting personal info stolen.
So I would suggest that parents or siblings that know alot about roblox and its flaws should educate their children/sibling about controls and safety before letting them play roblox for the first time by themselves. Young children should always be aware of dangers on the internet. Not everything will be safe.
After all, I think roblox is a really cool game for youngsters. It’s just that not everything will go well on the platform, and not everything is appropriate although the platform is
meant to be child-friendly. I’ll always let my children play this game in their free time, but will always be aware of safety and privacy.","Adult"
"age 8+","Okay, so Roblox would be good for 8+ depending on maturity, because this game has some sexual content but I think you should just report and leave it alone. They're some people who find cheats to say bad stuff, I would give an example but some kids might be reading. I have a 11,9, and 8 year old who play this and they are really happy. My 11 year old, he develops games a lot and he enjoys it, plus he gets his ""robux"" from people buying stuff from his game. I think he calls it a ""gamepass"".
I would say he should get off but this is a safe way to communicate with friends. I suggest this to kids who are mature and think about they're actions. A lot of parent don't see the truth. I played this with my son and it was really fun. But then I saw people cursing so I told him he cant play anymore. Then he kept asking me to try again. I saw that this game was extremely fun for him and I learned about creating games from him. Just some kids go stealing money from they're parents. I'm not saying all just some.","Adult"

"age 8+","I joined roblox in 2016. I'm a kid, I made this account and this review, to try and give a proper review of roblox. First off I will talk about violence, some might think it's too realistic or that it's just violent and it influences the mind of kids. Well, realism is actually a good thing, I think. It's better off to show kids that if they become soldiers they might get shot by a bullet and not respawn. Or.. maybe the kids would have in their mind ""It's cool in the army and movies so much action I like guns haha."" Well better teach them, I guess. Next off- online dating. So many parents talk about online dating on roblox, and, I guess you are guilty for not telling your kid/kids about what strangers can do, their intentions, how to defend, how to understand, kids are always curious so they do the wrong thing to see what happens, because guess what- you don't tell them what happens! Ha, ha, trust me even if we have little bodies we can only evolve our brains learning just like you did when you were little. If you give your phone and location to a stranger of course the stranger will come to your house. If the stranger attacks you defend yourself don't run because it will become worse. So what I'm trying to point out is that you should educate them better not judge us because we're little we still have brains if you don't help us evolve we will do mistakes not knowing because you don't tell us everything lol. Thankfully, I use the internet to find information, not to go on Instagram or whatever website there is with no point just to manipulate you to make you become its slave. Hm.. but how do I know all this HMMMM.. well first off. I joined Roblox, first groups I joined were war groups, immediately earned maturity, I began understanding and guess what it was pretty fun. When the WW2 Community collapsed I was curious about the dark side of roblox. I started looking at them, researching them, just like test bunnies. Lmao. Guess what, most of them may be depressed teenagers, maybe adults or teens with no life, spoiled kids(because you don't tell them what to do clearly) and such. A kid can lie about his/her age and the other can tell things not ""appropiate for their age"" but they still understand it cause guess what even if we have different bodies we're still the same species and it's your job to educate us when you're little and not let us into this madness. Shame on you parents. I had to understand it myself. No one told me. I'm proud I know. Even if I know about bad.","Adult"
"age 9+","Hello, Parents and Children! My name is Connor. I have been playing Roblox for over three years now. Roblox is a massively multiplayer online and game creation system platform that allows users to design their own games and play a wide variety of different types of games created by other users.
By creating a Roblox account you must sign up. By signing up with a account below thirteen years old it will automatically filter inappropriate games that should not be seen by small children.
After you create your account you will be able to:
* Create Games
* Play Games (may be limited if account is younger than thirteen)
* Browse the Catalog (browse from hats to shirts to best fit your character looks!)
* Buy Robux (in-game currency)
If you do have a account younger than thirteen, SafeChat will be enabled. Which will allow them to not see certain messages from other players. Roblox is still trying to fix their filter, but some players may bypass swearing by using exploits (hacks) or adding more letters.
Roblox also added in Parental Controls which allows Parent or Legal Guardians to control their kids behavior. Initially, Roblox is a platform which has many games for children to play. Some games are very inappropriate. These games will be banned and so will the player within hours.
You may also have to teach your kids about scamming methods that other players use. Roblox will not ask you for your password or email and you cannot get free Robux.
If you would like Robux, you will have to buy them from the store.
Another thing that parents may be curious of is the players. Some players can be bullies and say mean things. You can fix this by joining another server or reporting them. Initially, Roblox is a fun community with caring players.
Thank you for reading this review.","Adult"
"age 9+","I give roblox a 5 star rating for a few reasons. This platform, unlike other games, is purely made from the players. So your child can meet thousands of different players and they can collaborate with others in games such as Work at a Pizza Place, or duel it out in a all out battle in Crossroads. Now does this game have blood and death? No and yes. Roblox does not have blood in most games, however your character can die. Do not panic however! Most of the time when you die, it shows your character's body parts coming off, like Legos. Now I will say this, Roblox can have pay to win aspects, s&amp;x, bypassing and privacy concerns, you can disable the chat feature to prevent this. I strongly believe that it is the parent's responsibility to keep their children safe. In this game, your child can show their creativity to world by making a Roblox game! and if they are lucky, they can make real life money! This is why I like Roblox.","Adult"

"age 6+","Well, Roblox is a very good game. it is a game where players can create their worlds and games for others to play. So, you parents who think that Roblox's main theme is violence, one word to describe you, 'Karen' but their customer service is bad. I agree I agree ok. but some of you, I suspect you aren't even parents ok. because I see that some of you can't even spell. So in conclusion, Roblox is a good game for children","Adult"
"age 2+","its great","Adult"
"age 13+","My daughter played this game for just over 2 years. There was a random $200 charge on the account, which the bank resolved thankfully. Instead of Roblox freezing the account and resolving the issue they merely deleted her account without any contact or resolution. 2 days after her account was cancelled they still withdrew $20 monthly subscription fee and refused to refund it. The customer support is awful and they treat you like they are superior to you. Happy to provide the emails and proof of all of this.","Adult"

"age 10+","Some games have violence, and a lot of Roleplay games play BF/GF. The only good roleplay game here is Bloxburg. They also have a thing called 'robux' that you have to pay for for your kids to get gamepasses and avatar clothes. Recently, I saw people saying 'gay' and other stuff.","Adult"
"age 2+","Hi everyone I was once looking at ratings for Roblox and i said yes to letting my child play, i was watching my kid play and I started playing myself it is suitable for under 10 year old.
The bad comments are NOT true it also is a safe place to play and learn","Adult"
"age 7+","So, in this game, you create an account, then download the client to play games. Most have those images of family such as Adopt Me, but those games can easily be avoided and just go to a cops and robber game, one of which sent Badcc (actually a teen!) to collage via DevEx, using his great coding skills. So this game has influence on the community. And while you have to pay for MOST OF the items, you can get a couple of those and some rThro items for free. Most of the games with violence (Zombie Rush) don’t usually contain blood to keep it from becoming overly suggestive.
Overall, I would prefer ROBLOX to anyone who likes good quality games.
And kids themselves can make games in ROBLOX Studio, and if their game is made well-scripted but not finished, they can sell access for ROBUX, the currency paid for with real money. And they can make products and sell those (along with game passes) for ROBUX.","Adult"
"age 7+","I think this is a good because it can teach you scripting which can get you a job there is a lots of family friendly games and it maders about what game you join in my opinion roblox is a fun game where friends can play fun game and have fun:)","Parent of a 10-year-old"
"age 5+","At its best , ROBLOX has a population of good people. even some games may be a 13+ game but that's fine. But there may be some S.A.P.C .(Safety and privary conerns) incoulding online dating and swearing but thats rare now for some reason and free robux scams. but in whole this devloping platform is for 5+","Adult"
"age 10+","There are many positive aspects to this game; creative for the player and the many different games within this game are inventive, player can create items within the game and make games themselves, the music is good, there are ways for the player to make money and purchase items and has many of the gaming aspects that children seek. Some of the negative aspects are that many of the games involve killing one another with very real sounding guns, it does promote consumerism and since other player can create and share games, inappropriate games will sometimes appear.
One game involved the player using a very real sounding machine gun, on the hunt. The view perspective of the player was through a cloth and to other players it appeared to be a turban. Another game had players with very large penises. My son reported it and that game was gone the next day.","Parent of a 6 and 10-year-old"
"age 8+","Awesome","Parent"
"age 13+","This is a HORRIBLE forum for children. There are violent games, little to no moderation, and ineffective parent controls. My youngest played for only 2 weeks before getting stalked by a child predator. I am unable to retrieve chat logs and can only report account abuse on the specific privacy violations they've written. The chat ""limitations"" for children are extremely easy to bypass. What a terrible lesson to learn the hard way.","Parent"
"age 15+","Having been a veteran of this game for up to 6 years, the moderation services used for keeping the community safe and appropriate for all ages has severely declined and are not as efficient as they used to be.
Reports will often go unanswered, enabling users who curse and act inappropriately to continue said behavior. Additionally, the act of false reporting en masse has been known to result in innocent users being moderated or even having their accounts terminated for no reason. This is because in part that the community is composed of up to 4 million users, and with a diminutive staff to handle the reports: they have made use of an automatic system that processes a report with the assistance of filters. While it theoretically makes it easier for them to handle reports, this filter can be ""broken"" by repeatedly sending the same report over and over until a user has been wrongfully moderated. This fault continues to be abused on a daily basis.
Additionally, any amount of cursing or inappropriate content will not be detected by filters simply by creating spaces in sentences or using special characters such as ""&amp;"" or ""#"" to disguise it.
Side note: a considerable bulk of games are also oriented around violence and shooting. Users who play these games tend to be more hostile/aggressive, leading to swearing and mean spirited behavior - which potentially exposes younger aged children to words that any parent would not want their child to ever use.","Adult"
"age 10+","Listen,I've seen all of the reviews saying that it has to much violence and drugs and sex.What I want to say is,me and my 13 year old son have played it multiple times,and i've never seen sex or drugs,violence?Yes.But shielding your kid from violence is like shielding them from reality.Think about it,with all that's going on in the world,it's better to tell them than have them find out by themselves(at the age of 10+ you should tell them)(also a lot of the games that are the most popular are town and city and roleplaying).Cursing rarely happens,and the fact that they let players make games can compell them to do innapropriate stuff,but this hasn't happened in my 3 years of playing with my son(we started off at 10).Since he likes playing with people a lot,he went for the first game on the most popular list,Call or Robloxia 5,the game was bassically a more kid friendly version of Cold of Duty,World at War.I saw kid friendly becuase it was multiplayer only,so if there is swearing in the game,it's by a player,and if you play on a sepreate account from your child's(one 13+),but you still play in the same servers,you can report that person.Another reason i call it kid friendly,the graphics on ROBLOX closely resemple those of minecraft's,so the fighting looks almost cartoonish.","Adult"
"age 13+","The community is terrible! Yes there is alot of swearing! yes u will see someone showing innoproprete stuff! not all the games are terrible... And if u say you are under 13 u will get sended with ######## ######## ###### EVERYTIME SOMEONE SAYS SOMETHING NOT IN THE DICTIONARY! IT MAKES ME WONDER IF IT WAS A BAD WORD OR SOMETHING! so i keep it off so i wont see the hashtags! but i do enjoy some games on it... and not all the people are bad on it, but i think the roblox creators should of did a better on the safechat... people say bad words different then the real word... PS people are aloud to make ANY game they want on it so once a month u will come across a game of sex roleplaying... two stars for roblox","Adult"
"age 10+","My child was on the game regularly and was banned. I received an email saying ""inappropriate language"" which is not correct. Then when I question through the email provided, I'm told it was because of fraud. Which ever it was with no explanation, the account was deleted without warning after hard earned money was spent over weeks of play. I'm a working professional and I can't say anything good about this experience. My daughter is now an anti roblox activist and quiet convincing with her friends and peers. This game and company are up to no good.","Adult"
"age 9+","This game is absolutly perfect. My 9 yr old girl plays this game and its perfect. Your kids can learn to code and earn money which with they can buy virtual clothes. Most of the games don't have gun/killing. For example Phantom Forces. It is a shooter which doesn't even have blood. THIS GAME IS PERFECT!!!! You can set your pin your email to your childs account so you have full control of their account.
There are virtual cafés where there are like-minded kids pretending to play at a reseraunt. There are games like ERLC where your kid can become a cop and arrest criminals. There is Brookhaven where your kids can roleplay with their friends an meet other people. The Roblox mods are very kind and smart where they can help all the time.

Some games will have blood, and some games in the horror genre will contain jumpscares and disturbing images. Just a precaution.","Adult"
"age 8+","ROBLOX Is a online game, which means there will always be bad people. If you tell your children to avoid roleplay games such as ""Adopt and raise a baby"" etc, your kids will be safe online. In those games there are online daters. It depends on what games you play to avoid these bad people, don't play games that is family related, because those are the games most people come to and troll there and do bad things to children. The parental controls may be a joke, but if you tell your kids to avoid these games they most likely will.","Adult"

"age 16+","Roblox does not prioritize kids' safety. If your kid is making games by themself, and not buying anything from the store, this is maybe a safe game.

I am a Roblox user since February 2016. I love this game and you can get quite creative in it. Though, there are lots of violent games (e.g. Phantom Forces, and other shooting games) but it's not a plague of them. The chat filter works. Perhaps it works too much. I ###'# know ### this is #########, but communication is not a concern either. There are sex games but they get removed fairly quickly. You can also program your own games.

"age 13+","I am sitting here on my computer while my 9 year old nephew is playing Roblox Minecraft Tycoon with my 12 year old daughter. The two of them are constantly saying the words: Kill, Murder, and Death while playing the game. For this reason alone, I think this game is inappropriate for kids less than 13. It is desensitizing them to these words and themes and even when not playing the game my 12 year old daughter is saying the word murder a lot.
I am not the type of person who cares about swear words and religious censorship, but I was shocked at the level of Murder, Death, Kill that was part of this game.","Adult"
"age 2+","For the most part, Roblox is really fun. I would personally recommend it to your kids if they've been bugging you about being bored. But the one thing that is a bother is Roblox moderation is terrible. So just be really cautious and what you say. Also, I've seen so many people complain their kids are meeting predators, and yes, that's bad and what they're failing to do is monitor what they're children are doing. If you dont wan't to be a helicopter parent, just turn off the chat until they know the dangers fully.","Adult"
"age 18+","I let my 9 year old daughter play a game called roblox and helped her with making an account.

"age 15+","The other day i saw that my itunes balance was 0 when i tried purchasing a spotify premium. I went and asked my daughter if she wasted any money on her game and on robux, she answerd no.

I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE MY DAUGHTER LYING TO ME, the customer service told me that a bundle of 10,000 ROBUX was spend a few weeks ago ALONG WITH A ONE MONTH SUBSCRIPTION FOR A WAYV TICKET?! he even told me he is seeing ALOT of robux and roblox purchases. I immediatly left the call and took my daughter's phone, pc, xbox, vr and hide it in the bottoms of our house. Always monitor your childs before they learn how to buy a ticket and leave the country","Adult"
"age 12+","My kids were addicted to Roblox and it became the only thing they wanted to do. Even with imposing time restrictions, it sucked the joy out of their lives as they would mope around until they could get back on their iPads to play it. Other games have not been so detrimental to their mental health as this. If I left them to play it, they would not leave their rooms and would stare at the screen obsessively all day. This is not healthy for them. Once I made the decision to delete it, after some crying and moaning for a couple of days, they became ‘children’ again. I think more parents should consider going cold turkey. We had a much better time with Apple Arcade. Lots of games to play but not this level of addiction. I want my kids to actually have a childhood.","Adult"
"age 7+","Two weeks ago I let my daughter (age 8) play roblox. I thought it was an innocent app that wasn’t harmful in any way. A few days after, she showed me this game called “brookhaven” she showed me the game, and I thought it was a fine game except for the guns you could equip. Last Thursday, while she was at school, I decided to see what roblox was really about. I got onto her iPad and joined a game called fashion famous. The game was really cool but also had some pretty rude people. They judged you based on what you wore. So I left, and when my daughter got home, I asked her we were going to try to turn off chat in roblox. We figured out how after 20 minutes of nonstop confusion and my daughter could play her roblox happily without getting bullied. So if you kid is not over 10, I recommend turning off chat.","Adult"
"age 6+","This is not my opinion, this is true, ROBLOX is Awesome. It is totally ok for your child to use ROBLOX. There are some violent games. If you do not want your child to play the violent games, you can go to settings and make it so your child can’t play the violent games. There is chat but parents can turn chat off in settings. ROBLOX is free,
you can buy ROBLOX money called “Robux” but you don’t HAVE to buy it. ROBLOX can be educational also. If you are not on Mobile, then you can use ROBLOX studio. ROBLOX studio is were you can make games and play them. Making games involves coding and building. And that is educational. So I Highly recommend using ROBLOX for your child.","Adult"
"age 5+","This game is very good for children 5 years old and above. It is highly recommended from my opinion because it is educational. Also, it teaches them life lessons!

"age 18+","Don't get me wrong, roblox is a great platform for our kids to relax on during their free time, and I genuinely like it.

This game gives kids access to a wide range of expensive, exotic mobile vehicles, allowing them to do whatever they want with them! Even worse, the game provides a variety of ""torture chambers"", and encourages the kids to destroy the cars in those chambers in exchange for money! The game is literally encouraging the destruction of property! It should not be allowed! This is absolutely intolerable, and our kids should not be encouraged to condone violence against mobile vehicles!","Adult"
"age 18+","Roblox must be banned for children. It’s not gaming platform but paradise for scammers. Scammers are never punished and victims are never supported by Roblox team. Any player on Roblox could easily contact your child ant take all his items that you purchased. It’s real robbery that must be banned. Complains about scams are useless because Roblox is surprisingly will always be on scammers’ side. Some games on Roblox are just too similar to casinos and if you don’t want your child to became a gambler and loose his money never let him play Roblox.","Adult"
"age 13+","Recently my son got scammed by Roblox's own system, by a glitch known as a UUC scam. $600 down the drain, full of hackers and scammers, terrible security, and terrible service, Roblox support is unhelpful and offer poor support.","Adult"

"age 17+","m-m-my sonny Thomas is so mean h-h-he refused to help me with the chores now h-h-he always plays roblox and never try to get e-e-education from his school. I got a call last w-w-week from his physics teacher saying that thomas d-d-doesnt know how a s-s-strom is formed in the sky. I wrote a l-l-letter and send it to roblox b-b-but they said they d-d-dont handle these kinds of situation. Today I a-a-asked thomas to answer 6×1 but he sang neo got my back instead. That s-s-song is so satanic and demonic and im s-s-sure roblox has to do something with i-i-it.","Adult"
"age 18+","in some games there are blood and people can number swear and my 8 year old son is repeating these bad words and most of all people can ask you for your address so dont bother to get this game.","Adult"
"age 10+","I played this game myself. So I introduced this game to my son, he liked it. One day he asked me could I have some Robux? Because myself play that game for a few years now, I know how much are they. I usually use Robux gift cards a lot, and I gave one to him. So, for me, the prices are pretty fair. But Roblox never gives people to buy gift cards except for the USA and Canada! But mostly this game has a lot of different games inside this game. Almost it never got hacked, the most important thing is violent games, scammers, and hackers. So I know a few of the games that will be hacked quite often.
1, Jailbreak (often hacked and violent)
2, MM2 (murder mystery 2) (violent)
3, Phantom Forces ( violent)
4, Arsenal (violent and toxic)
Mostly if your son is 10 years old or older, you could let them play the games listed, but the most important thing is. DO NOT play Adopt Me. Jailbreak always somehow has glitches in it, mostly gets patched in 3 or 2 days.
So that's my review!
Ah, one thing forgot to tell you, it's Roblox Premium. You need to pay monthly, BUT you will get more Robux and monthly! So I will personally give it a 7.56/10","Adult"
"age 9+","First of all, it is a great game with lots of different people to be friends with and play games with. there are games of different types, so if there appears a PG-13 game for like 1 second doesn't mean the whole thing is the devil. So I'm gonna try to cover it all up for y'all.
So first, online dating can never go THAT far, as when things go as far as that, the moderators ban NSFW clothes, games, etc.
Exploiters don't do anything bad. As far as they can go, is ruing the game for others, but it's easy enough to just enter a new lobby. They can't hack your child's account right off the bat.
There is a chat filter in place for children who registered as less that 13 y/o. of course, if you're older, it is less strict. There is a filter on swearing and numbers. Of course there are gonna be scrubs that bypass, but it's the internet after all. All you have to do is block them
Trolling and bullying does exist, just like in real life. you just have to teach your children to ignore them. don't let some shitbags to ruin your view of the game.
Your children know what they are doing. they know how to manage the game better than how you do taxes. they most likely know more about this game than you, so ask them their OWN view of the game before rating it 18+.
Yes, there is a game called murder mystery 2. Yes, there is MMORPG games. but those aren't the only ones out there smh. there are even filters in place already.
And yes, I understand that there is currency, but you have to teach your child that it is not necessary to enjoy the game, and it's a waste of money, and brings no help at all.
Now that I can tell you all what you have wrong about ROBLOX, I can tell what I think.
I think there are games appealing to different people. There is even a studio where they can make and share their own creations, and the gameplay is great, and the community too (expect the scumbags that we talked about earlier)
Most of this was to tell you christian families to stfu with this overreacting","Adult"
"age 8+","Yes, I am a kid. I am 14 years old making this review. Made an adult account to stop you parents from worrying about your child playing ROBLOX. First off, ROBLOX is 100% family friendly. If theres a game that has sexual content just know that its not made by ROBLOX, It is made by the ""Community"" So instead of blaming it on ROBLOX blame it on the community. If a player swears at your child or bullies your child just use the report feature. ROBLOX is also VERY educational. How? You can learn coding in the game from the application called ROBLOX studio. All I'm gonna say is. If theres a sex game, its made by the community. ROBLOX does take down games that are not family friendly. Now about strangers. You're scared that your child will give out personal info. Like your child is not going to spam your IP address. The worst your child can do is say there name or age, if that's a little too much for you just tell them to not say anything about yourself and just play the game. So please, Don't blame ROBLOX.","Adult"
"age 16+","The website isnt good at all. Constantly being hacked if you go to free robux games, also the customer service doesnt work at all, condos and more do not play unless monitored.","Adult"
"age 9+","This game is great for students, especially gifted ones like my daughter Sophie. She is in 5th grade, and this game made her seem like she was in 10th! One day, for her once-a-year reward, I let her play ROBLOX. After she came off the computer, she started explaining to me College Algebra even I didn't understand! After I checked out the game, I learned that it is really good if you want your kid to learn above their grade level and exceed the standard in class. My absolute favorite game the platform holds is called Jailbreak, which requires cops and robbers to either arrest or get away, respectively, by solving Math Problems. I totally recommend letting your kids play this game, as it is even better than IXL!","Adult"
"age 2+","This does not have sex in it! None in my kids two years playing!","Adult"
"age 6+","Roblox is NOT a game, but rather a platform. On Roblox developers create, program, design, and build their own games, which go through a strict content moderation check. If your game is popular enough you can make money off of it. Roblox has loads and loads of very educational games, such as one that teaches kids what to do in a house fire, and how to safely escape and get help, one that teaches math in a fun way, and plenty more that involve thinking, math, puzzle solving, and strategy. When it comes to your child viewing iffy stuff(Personally, I have never seen anything inappropriate on Roblox, and I've been playing for ten years.), the blame lies on you, not Roblox. The only way for someone to access inappropriate content on Roblox is to know what they're looking for. In order for a game to get on the front page it has to be very popular, and it has to be handpicked by moderators at Roblox. Otherwise, you have to search for the game by its name or other keywords, meaning you'd have to know what you're looking for. I was reading an article written my some ""concerned parent"" talking about inappropriate games on Roblox and how they're accessed by searching certain random words, I tested it to see if it was true, it was not, the words were censored. If your child is viewing iffy stuff on Roblox, you as the parent are to blame, your child would have to know what to search in order to find those games. But moving on, Roblox has multiple safety and privacy features, including turning off chat completely, setting your child's birthday(when you first make the account, if the account has already been made then just change the date of birth from, I believe the privacy menu. ) to a year/month that sets them to under 13 years of age(meaning 11-23-2008 to 11-23-20) which will enable safe chat, safe chat is a mode that filters a lot more things than normal chat(mainly just minor things like numbers and normal chat filter bypasses). Now people have bypassed the chat filter before, but it is very hard. Also, when you report someone on Roblox, rather than just say what happened, I find it best to take multiple screenshots and/or record the incident, type up a report, include the date and time(include your time zone), and include the links to the screenshots(it's best to use Gyazo, if you don't know what Gyazo is, then Google it.), and include the link to the recording(s). This makes it far easier for the moderators, and greatly improves the chances of a faster response. All-in-all, Roblox is a very fun, and often times educational game platform that can help kids learn, pass the time, get much needed social interaction(during the lockdown), and generally learn life long lessons that might help them later down the road(things like programming, scripting, game design and building, the list goes on).","Adult"
"age 10+","am 12 and I love this game!! there are some inappropriate games but they are very hard to find and get taken down fast,I recommend playing Royale high,Bloxburg.","Adult"
"age 12+","Roblox is over all very good, and allows your child to either build their own game, or play other games and have a lot of fun. My child enjoys the building games, but everyone is different. The main problem with Roblox is buying, however most parents don't know that their is a block player option that makes it so some users can't chat, or join your child. The other problem is in app purchases. Many children keep wanting more and more of this Roblox currency which costs real money. This can be managed by only allowing your children to use robux on game passes. There are three things robux can be spend on. Avatar accessories, which are a waste and children usually get tired of. There are vip servers, and buying temporary boosts. These are the biggest wastes and keep your children wanting more and more robux. There are however game passes which are the cheapest of all of these, and are permanent boosts that improve the players experience of the game for however long they play it. I recommend only buying this game passes to improve their game experience without them wanting more and more.","Adult"

"age 8+","Roblox is a really fun game and children would find it very fun!!. The game creators are often really good at creating games, the privacy is the best!. However sometimes there might be scammers and exploiters who might upset your children a lot.","Adult"
"age 14+","Roblox itself is a good game but of course its the players that make it not kid friendly at all. Im 18 and play Roblox occasionally.
First off Roblox has a strict chat filter and it censors out a lot of words but there are so many ways to get around this. Ill give some examples of the stuff I saw when playing this game that I can remember off the top of my head: Someone telling kids to go to a website called ""rule 34"" which is basically known for the most disturbing and disgusting videos on the internet. I have not gone to this website but people talk about it. Ive seen people get into fights in the chat and and one player says ""yourgirlfriendhasthesmallesttiddiesever"" and another goes on to say stuff about ""your mom has cow tits"" ect. I have seen people talk about ""Hitting a chick from the back"" and head. I always report these kinds of people but Roblox's moderation is AWFUL. I will get into that more in another point.
Next thing is the thing I hate most. In a lot of Roblox games you can buy a thing that will probably be called a ""Radio gamepass"" or a ""Stereo gamepass"" or whatever else. Its basically a gamepass that will cost Robux that allows users to upload and play an audio on a radio or stereo and other players in that server will hear that song if they are standing close to them. ALOT of people bypass Roblox's audio moderation and will play inappropriate music with swearing and inappropriate themes. The incident that made me write this review was me and my 6 year old sister were playing a game called ""PetWorld"" Where you can be different animals ect. Someone had a radio and started playing a bunch of inappropriate songs like ""Dicks in my butt, shes such a slut I nut.., I fuck your mother she.. And very loud female moaning noises. It exposed my 6 year old sister to that. Developers only really put these in their games so they can make money off of people buying it but if Roblox isnt going to have a good moderation team then I think they should not allow this. I dont know how blatant screaming moaning noises went through their moderation team.
Roblox has the worst moderation ive ever seen. I know Roblox likes to say that everything on their website goes through a moderation team but thats either a lie or the people on their moderation team are lazy and just accept anything without looking at them. So many inappropriate audios are uploaded to their website and used.
There are inappropriate games. There are inappropriate games that can do anything from pose characters in sexual ways, animate the players characters to simulate sex acts ect. Roblox itself does not make games, independent developers do but anyone can make a Roblox game so these games show up. Basically everyone in the Roblox community knows about them so I guess theyre pretty common. Ive never been in one of these games and they do not show up on the front or home page, you would have to search for them or know what to search for to get to them. But I have seen other weird or disgusting ones with a thumbnail of a woman Roblox character farting or shitting ect. I don't think these would be much of a problem if you watch what games your kid is playing. Roblox is a bit better with banning peoples accounts for making these and taking down the games than they are at moderating the audios. They really need better moderation, the game makes so much money yet cant afford a better moderation system considering they are soon to be adding ingame voice chat and videos which I think is a horrible idea considering what happens with the audios.
Ive also seen just disgusting games show up on the front page like ""Eat poop simulator"" ""Pick a toilet"" and more poop/fart themes.
Like I said before when I see people talking about inappropriate things I report them but when I check on their account days later theyre not banned. When reporting someone Roblox says they will review the ingame chats and if they find anything they will take action but I believe they do not do this at all. In the Roblox community lots of people talk about how Roblox doesnt ban people who talk about inappropriate things.
Another point I wanted to make is about ""Online Dating"" Roblox is against online dating and doesnt let you say ""I love you' or anything like that in the chat. But online dating is still a big thing in Roblox and I feel like it would be very easy for a predator to make a Roblox account and online date a kid. But im sure this is a problem on any social platform. The thing im more concerned about is the sex stuff that happens and it does. The games to look out for are called ""Condo"" games.
Another thing just to mention if you are concerned about this, in popular girl games such as ""Royale High"" and ""Crown Academy"" There are ""Sexy"" outfits girls can put on.
For this game the currency is called Robux. The only way you can earn Robux is by spending real life money. You dont need Robux to play games but to buy gamepasses and extra perks you need them. You also need them to customize your character and buy outfits ect.
As for violence there are shooter and killing games but theyre not graphic as Roblox forbids blood or anything graphically violent.
Another point I want to make is about their most popular game ""Adopt Me"" Its a kid friendly game where users buy eggs and take care of them by bathing, feeding, playing with ect. until they hatch into a surprise animal. You earn ingame cash by doing those chores then you can buy more eggs and repeat. There are rarities to animals such as ""Common, Rare, Extra Rare, Legendary"" ect. and players take it very seriously. There is a lot of scamming and different ways to scam. One way is called a ""Trust trade"" where the player will get the other to trust them and then use the trading system to get the player to give them their pet first and then they will gift their pet in return but what ends up happening is they get the player to gift them their pet then will leave. There are a few ways this scam works but basically I would tell kids to not gift their pets to anyone or they will get scammed. My problem with this game is it is very consumerism like. There are so many things in this game that cost real life money and most people who play this game end up spending real life money on it because all of the ""good"" or popular stuff you need to buy with real life money. But I don't have a problem with my little sister playing this game.
Last point is it is difficult to give away personal information. Ive only seen someone give away their Instagram before. I think its impossible to give away phone numbers and addresses.
Are the games even good? That depends which type of game youre playing. There are a lot of games that are called ""Simulators"" where the basis of the game is to click and the more you click the more money you get for upgrades. A bit mindless if you ask me. Theres games like Adopt me where you collect pets, theres ""horror"" games like Piggy where one person is a pig and the others have to run from it before it catches you. Theres shooter games like arsenal or phantom forces. Theres games like Islands where you start off on a small island and collect trees and plants and try to slowly build up a huge island with farms and houses ect. Theres games like murder mystery where one player is selected and is given a knife but the other players dont know who the murderer is, theres games like my restaurant where you start off with a small restaurant and try to build it into a huge restaurant making millions of dollars, theres games like jailbreak where you can choose if you want to be a cop or a prisoner and can either do heists for money or stop others from doing heists and collect money. Those are the most popular games on the front page. You decide if you want your kid to play. I would recommend monitoring them.","Adult"
"age 18+","When I was posting as a 13 year old child there was so many 10-8 year olds OD ( Online Dating ) I was so shocked to see sex,violence,drinking,smoking,drugs and swearing by using numbers and this is unaccompanied for a 10-8 year old child to play this is a risky game! I wouldn't recommend this game not the best to play without parents permission and seeing what your child is actually doing. Roblox needs to also permanently banned scams as well! Roblox should be shut downed and updated to be safer or be permanently banned from every device.","Adult"

"age 8+","Dear Parents, from the creators of some roblox games, if you think roblox is a bad game, you should think outta the box because not all of roblox's games are bad, the ROBLOX Staff did not make the games on the front games, it's actually kids/teens/adults that make these games, based on there imagination and you should see the point because ROBLOX is never cause of your review, its your children/teens that make these games, not roblox. ROBLOX motto is ""POWERING IMAGINATION"" and if y'all parents think the youtubers are bad influence to your child.

"age 10+","ROBLOX is generally a family friendly game, however you should know very key concepts that ROBLOX offers so you get a real grasp of the game as a whole. ROBLOX is a game, where people can make an account and play games. However, these games are curated by the moderators but in my opinion, not curated very good, but more about that later in my review. My first suggestion in considering letting your child play the game, is play it yourself! Nobody can give a better review on how you feel better then yourself. After that, sit down with your child and help them set up an account. Make sure that you connect your email to the account for security purposes like if the child forgets their password and so you can monitor activity. I would suggest making the age on the account &gt;13 as this is the most secure way of blocking any form of inappropriate content from reaching your child. If you do the 13+ option inappropriate content is much more likely to be shown from other users. Watch out for the consumerism of ROBLOX, they have a currency called ""Robux"" which is basically their own currency to buy virtual items. Robux is really expensive there are cheaper alternatives to buy them, however Builders Club (A montly/yearly subscription that gives daily robux) is only bought directly from the website. After creating the account, go to the settings form the cogwheel in the upper right hand corner next to the Robux amount the account has and enter settings. In settings set up the parental controls to whatever you want. I personally suggest setting off communication links (twitter, discord, youtube etc.) account restrictions and in Privacy settings you can eliminate the entire risk of other players chatting with your child by setting off any contact from other players and let the child enjoy the game with how it is. Overall, with all of the restrictions that they offer and generally just being a smart parent you can ensure that your child is happy and safe and having fun while playing ROBLOX.","Adult"
"age 4+","Please, stop complaining, it’s not that bad. For those who say you need pay so much money, you do not need robux. Don’t buy it! Pornographic content? Put on age restrictments. Swearing, same thing, the words go hastagged! Like come on you can’t even say numbers. Just please stop, if it’s that bad don’t let your kid play it! Don’t complain to others that they shouldn’t.","Adult"
"age 10+","The thing is, it's not roblox's fault that your kids play the games that are on there. If your kid is seeing pornographic content, it's because they clicked the game. All of the decals, clothing, and everything are hand reviewed by the moderation team and roblox will know if something is wrong.
Games, however, are not reviewed by their team unless there is a report filed against the game, which will take up to 24 hours for the team to open and read into. If there's a game called 'sex life' and your kid clicks it, don't accuse roblox because of what your kid's into. Maybe instead you should properly parent them to teach them what is okay to play on the game and what is not okay.
People say that your kid is talking to a pedophile? Likely it's because they clicked on a dating roleplay game, one of the many kinds of cancer that we don't want on the site yet roblox reels in the money toward. Things like 'meep city' 'roblox high school' and anything that involves roleplaying and houses will definitely provoke online dating behaviors from 12-13 year olds who think it's funny. Don't take it seriously because chances are if they say ""hey baby I think you're hot"" they are talking about your child's VIRTUAL CHARACTER. There is no way that they can see what you look like outside of roblox and no information can be given about your personal life unless your daughter gets it through the filter.
Roblox does put many efforts to ensure that the game is child safe. Ultimately the experience your kids gets out of it is dependant on what they think is funny to click and what they want to play. If you play a game that says ""adopt a baby!"" you can guarentee that some 12 year old will start pretending that him and your child are married or are dating.","Adult"
"age 6+","This game can be abused, as it is an 8 to 18 aimed website, but if you ever find anything with sexuality, or anything of that sort, you have to remember, this is the internet, anyone can say or do anything. If your child is younger, I would recommend being careful about, and making them earn trust to be on the site, and I would make yourself an account. If your child is older, I would recommend letting them play, especially if your child is very mature. I recommend the site and game fully, as long as younger ones are monitered.","Adult"

"age 12+","Roblox is a seemingly harmless game, however, some things are just plain disappointing about it. ""Roblox"" is a building game that allows you to build your very own house, or zombies, or giant monsters that terrorize you for no reason. Lua scripting is what makes the creations come to life, and it may lead kids to creativity. Some games, however are violent, and there are even RECREATIONS of games like GRAND THEFT AUTO. Lua scripting also can make blood splatter out of characters and make it MORE realistic. So that's violence. Now, sexy stuff really is not an issue, however some kids may date. Just make sure you tell your child that these people are just silly. Language is filtered out (aside from the minor h--l). Drinking and drugs are not an issue. Builder's Club is a paid membership that kids will want...if they get addicted. There is also Turbo and Outrageous, which are more expensive. My biggest concern is the safety of children on here. My son, 12, was at a game called ""Kohl's Admin House"". These two other children were BULLYING him and ""freezing"" and ""punishing"" him for ABUSING the admin (which is no reason to do that). I spoke to both of them and they luckily promised not to do it again. So their is my review on Roblox, if you want a SAFER place to go, please use Club Penguin.

Roblox has sex games are commonly referred to on the platform as ""condos"". They're spaces, generated by users, where people can talk about sex - and where their avatars can have virtual sex. In these games, Roblox's rules are thrown out of the window.
BBC indicate it also has

"age 18+","I am officially disgusted. My child (Shaquisha) is about 8 years old. I recently was in the kitchen making some chicken, adding salt as the seasoning, YOU KNOW. Typical mom things. I randomly hear my daughter say something that sounded very inappropriate. I checked up on her and she refused to give me back her tablet. I was petrified from the reaction so I decided to slap her across her face. I eventually got the tablet and realized that she was with this... BOY.. on some game called ""The good"" (obviously meaning dr*gs) I caught the young boy which seemed to be over the age of 47 STALKING my daughters character and calling her ""bby gorl"" ""suq my deeq"" so I didn't think anything much of it UNTIL I HEARD GUNS. Now in my Catholic house hold we don't tolerate this kind of behavior. I was devistaded and decided to call her father. He came home and punched the heavens out of my Shaquisha (as he should) and eventually reported the issue to Roblox. I went to go back to my cooking 1 hour later and AGAIN my daughter is on Roblox. I go back and it looked like she was taking care of a child in a house? Now after that I had a talk with her and she told me that she was a ""mother"" with her ""boyfriend"" getting ready for a (deepthroat) whatever that means. So I kicked her out of the house since she clearly wants to become a soloist mother. I don't recommend this game to ANYONE EVEN MY WORST ENEMY, it has caused stress and scars from time to time.

"age 11+","This game is great but if you are too let your son play on this game,here is some thing's you must know!
The majority of player's are good and kind but you will encounter rude people trying to bypass the chat filter in game's such as
Meepcity
Arsenal
Phantom Forces
ETC.
I'd say a majority of the game's on roblox has too much violence but most of them dont have blood and instead of a falling corpse,it looks like a cartoon falling flat.

There are some game's where people take it to the extreme by interacting in sexual intercourse via bypassing the chat and clothes,games to avoid

"age 10+","I'm 18. I think Roblox is a nice game/games to chill and play for a while (especially for younger kids with more imagination) but my problem with Roblox is that it doesn't REALLY teach kids anything, unless you go on learning games which kids aren't probably really interested in. But there are a lot of POPULAR games that require constant play because they want to farm for items, such as Royale High or Adopt Me. Also lots of games that promote real money spending. Like it'll cost real money for this ""epic dragon pet"". It'll cost around $100 irl or something. That's ridiculous since for one, its an online item and second of all little kids who don't have any jobs play these games and want these items. If my kids asked me for $100 for a digital item in a game, I would automatically think its a waste of money. Unless they did chores to earn that money, then its more acceptable. Another problem with Roblox is that you cannot exchange your money you spent (Robux, items you bought, gamepasses) into real money unless you're a developer. I have spent over $100 on an old account I used a long time ago. Now I have no use for that account and that money is just sitting on there doing nothing. My other problem with this game (its an ongoing problem) is the amount of weird online daters I see. In general I believe online dating is fine, as long as you're safe.. and I don't think you should be doing it if you're under 15. But on ROBLOX?? Really??? A game targeted towards 5-13 year olds mostly?? That's just weird and dangerous. Another problem with this game is that there are TONSSS, and I mean an absolute abundance of scams on Roblox. For whatever reason, Roblox allows these scams and it's really unfortunate to see kids unhappy because they can't get ""free robux"". I feel like Roblox isn't healthy for young minds anymore. If a kid is really that desperate for Robux, an in game currency. There's something wrong. Last problem with this game is I feel like a lot of developers are underrated and taken advantage of. Callmehbob (nightbarbie) for instance, her game has a massive amount of players each day and her graphics level on her game is absolutely insane. It's amazing, it should be a separate game from Roblox really. I can't even barely function Royale High on my $1,000 gaming laptop!
One more problem is I see a lot of inappropriate things on here. Including LGBTQ+ games which I think is really inappropriate for a little kid to see that. Also the Roblox community is really toxic.
I have played Roblox for 5 years now, and I would like to see it improve in these ways. I am 18 now and I need to start moving on.

"age 8+","Hello, my name is Alin and I will tell you why roblox is a great game. Roblox boosts creativity and gives the opportunity to create your own games on the platform. Roblox is very entertaining for children, there are many games like obbys,simulator,tycoons and they are really fun. You can buy gamepasses or other stuff like that with robux, robux is the roblox currency that you can buy for real money, it has a good price and it offers a good amount of it. Now I've seen reviews that people children have bought robux without their parent permissions, do not blame roblox, it's their parent's fault for leaving children with the option to buy stuff with real money and children are young and they don't think about that, put a pin on your credit card people! Roblox is a great platform over all, it's the children's parent's fault for neglecting the time their children is playing this game. Thank you for reading my opinion on why roblox is a great game!

"age 18+","This game may at one time been for kids but now it has turned into something toxic and potentially dangerous to children. Adults pose as children and groom them. They convince them to send naked pictures of themselves and then blackmail the child into sending more photos once they receive the first one. Children have committed suicide over instances such as this. Also Roblox says they have “strict safety features” but it doesn’t protect the child from being groomed on their site and talked into downloading third party apps to talk and exchange photos.

The final straw was my son's spell-check correcting Rozit (a Roleplay name), to 'Racist' which the system flagged as discriminatory despite him being in the game for 2 minutes and nothing else being said even remotely offensive.
Why bother with a game the creators don't bother with?","Adult"
"age 10+","Chat:
If your child knows online safety they will be fine. Every once and a while a few bad words slip through the system, but most of the time you are fine. If you don’t want your kid using any kind of chat you can go to settings and turn off the chat, or if you don’t want your kid to be private messaged, there are settings for that as well. For accounts aged under 13, extra safety settings are already added. If you don’t want your kid changing the privacy settings then use the pin to lock it down, they won’t be able to change their profile status or change settings without it.
Violence:
There are games with violence, but it doesn’t even look real. When the characters die they fall apart like LEGO’s.
Online dating:
Online daters are usually just role players and it’s never weird, they just pretend to have a family and another player is usually the child or family pet. Most of the weird videos you find online about Roblox characters being sexual or sexual games on Roblox are staged and are for clout. If there are weird games, they are private and made by weirdos and only people invited by links through social media can join them. They always get reported and taken down within an hour or so. If your kid doesn’t have social media then it’s not an issue, even if they did, these games very rarely slip through.
Voice chat:
Your kid can’t use voice chat without being at least 13, and they have to have proof and an ID. Voice chat is generally safe, when someone tries to cuss it gets bleeped out, and if you get bleeped out to many times you get a 24 hour ban. They have a detector to see if the ID is real or not, and it will ban you if it’s fake, and you’d have to appeal.
Robux:
Robux is an in-game currency that you can earn by making games or buy using real life money. If you have an email hooked to the account and the right settings turned on, it will email you when your kid spends money on robux. If your kid spends robux without permission, or you aren’t pleased with your purchase, sometimes you can get a refund. It is a little pricey though.
Bullying:
If your kid can handle being called a “noob” (this is a word the kids use to make fun of each other on the app, basically calling them a new player) or if they can handle being called stinky then they will be fine. If your child last account is rated above 13, they might be called dumb, but that’s about it.
Groups:
Groups are basically a mini forum page for kids. You can chat, advertise your game, or if your child has like a role play Roblox job, they can report “bad behavior” to the owner of the group. (The bad behavior is just little kid arguments)
Social media links/YouTube links:
If your account is rated 13, your child has the ability to add outside social links to their profile, like their YouTube channel, twitch streams, or other platforms, and they can also check out other people’s profiles to find these links as well. You have the option to get rid of this option if you go to settings.
Learning:
Your kid can totally learn from this platform. It’s really amazing to be honest. They can make their own game using Lua language (coding) and they can build as well.
This is also a fantastic app for online interaction (for children and adults) it is a good introduction to the internet, as it let’s your child talk to people across the world, but safely. You can make avatars and make your own group, and you can enjoy the game without having robux. The games and chats are moderated.
Things to remember:
This game is meant for tweens, teens, and young adults. However, it’s would probably be okay for a younger child if they are supervised, I would not let a younger child have access to chats, but for older kids and tweens, chat is perfectly fine. Expect a little bit of bad language. I really do think some parents are very over dramatic about Roblox, most of those parents let their 5 year old play without any restrictions and the child plays police officer role play games and sees their character die.
It’s a much better alternative then Fortnite or Minecraft where you can chat freely and use voice chat, which leads to much worse then a little bit of childish fights. Every game single game these days has complaints from parents about safety, well that’s the internet. Roblox is very safe and moderated, you most likely won’t have an issue. If you want your child to have more social time (especially during covid) that is safe, then use this app. It encourages creativity and it is fun.","Adult"

"age 16+","There are way too many violence and innapropaiate games even in the front page, and Roblox is 10+. There are fps games with blood and injury detail, which Roblox pretends to not notice. I see a lot of people who harrass people by gender and hating on LGBT. It's really unacceptable. There are games which refrence crime like Jailbreak, and games featuring Squid Game, which is obviously not suitable either. That only scratches the surface of why Roblox is not safe enough.","Adult"
"age 10+","Roblox is a game were you create games and play games. It is really enjoyable to create games and play the games. Children will learn some positive messages in some games like not to get over confident, but that’s not the point here. The point is that you have to be mature enough to play the game. It is one app with many games on it. In some games there are some stabbing/killing and very mild blood but it’s all cartoonish so nothing gets to over the top. In games like piggy and the mimic chapter lll there are some monsters/jump scares. By the way, if you’re kids are mature enough they won’t log in to the game (if you scroll down you can see what genre the game is. Ex: Horror.) As for language there’s mild name calling (« Stupid » « ass ») but no real swear words because ROBLOX blocks it. If anything pops up that’s not blocked children/adults can report that person and Roblox will take care of that. As for sexy stuff some games include sex/love but if you’re children are mature they won’t log in.
There’s tons of consumerism as in each game you log in there’s a box that pops up to buy robux. Robux is when you give real money to Roblox and you can get T-shirts for your profile or buy anything in the game. Also, Parents note that Roblox includes a lot of privacy and safety. When you first open the app it will ask you for a username (don’t use your real name) and your date of birth (don’t use your real one). Then it will ask you for a password (the password must not be similar to username) and then gender (which is optional).
In some games children may be send friend requests, but they shouldn’t accept them if they don’t know the person. They can easily get hacked.
If you forget about the negatives Roblox is a very fun and creative game to play with friends or with family.","Adult"

"age 13+","My twins are 10. They started off having a lot of fun playing simple innocent games on roblox. But this week, they ventured into some roblox games, which really traumatized them. Those games had cute characters and titles, so no one expected them to be scary. We missed scrolling down and seeing the scary label too. Half way into a seemingly kids friendly game, my boy had a kidnapper grab him and killed him. Before that, he spent a lot of time hiding in different places from the kidnapper. He started sobbing hysterically after he was killed in the game. It was as though he was living through a real kidnapping. He told me that he ran and hid, but there was no escape . Today, their friends who played roblox came over . They talked abt roblox and mentioned a game and spoke about devil, demon, hell, after hell etc. I realized there is a satanic element in some of the games. My daughter was crying before bed time tonight and it’s her turn to be traumatized by a roblox game. She said she was fearful of a roblox character. I prayed with her and she agreed to quit roblox. We still have robux, but it’s more important to care for their mental health. It started off as good simple fun. But it is Im possible to restrict the kids to that one game. Danger lurks when they start playing that next game. It’s a game for older kids.","Adult"
"age 6+","I’m sure you’ve looked up ROBLOX on YouTube or on google right? And how they say ‘Not safe for children!’ Well they are to a certain extent right but also wrong. If your child knows internet safety (They should be taught at school) than it’s pretty much fine. I’m going to write the pros and cons of ROBLOX.
Pros
1. It’s free. If you want to play ROBLOX for free than it’s fine. However if your child wants a wider range of clothing items or exclusive items/gear in games than it’s going to cost you money. Same as most games.
2. It can be a learning experience for your child. Many schools use ROBLOX and Minecraft in there coding lessons (If you want more detailed explanation I’d look it up on YouTube.)
3. It’s well moderated. It’s extremely well monitored. And they are strict on there censorship system.
Cons
1. There are a few dangers. While ROBLOX is well moderated and known as one of the most strict games with the the newly added voice chat system (I personally don’t use this for many reasons, and yes I do play ROBLOX) it can be slightly unsafe as well as scammers but I won’t go into all that because there is loads of YouTube videos about it all if you want a greater understanding (I’d watch Koneko Kitten now and then).
2. Games on it (especially for mobile users) can be either low quality or laggy or buggy as a result of your device going into an overload. I’d suggest playing on PC or console (e.g. Xbox) with good WI-FI.
So that is the pros and cons of ROBLOX. I believe it should be a 6+ as your kids should know about internet safety by then but if they don’t it’s worth explaining to them.","Adult"

She had lots of pets and got given roblox money for her birthday but they cancelled her account and gave us no explanation and she lost everything. She was devastated. Very disappointing that they cannot help and understand the challenges children face when they play this game. If they have a game aimed children then they should be more understanding of the challenges parents face when their kids play this highly addictive game.

"age 18+","","Adult"
"age 10+","I think that Roblox is a horrible game because of how many technical difficulties they have with their servers. They are always down or having issues to the point where you can not join any games for long periods of time. The games themselves are very slow and people within the games promote so much violence it is harmful to the innocent children that are on this platform. Many of the players bully other players and have inappropriate usernames that promote unspeakable things.","Adult"

Good: build, create or learn about ANYTHING, some experiences actually have a lot of thought and care put into them, 90% of everything is free, and there’s a ton of people: Cons: 18+ servers are quite rare, it’s very easy to get around the chat filter by just insulting someone in plain English, sex, violence, drugs and racism are everywhere just tucked away neatly, this site does not emphasize helping the weak or anybody really. Sure it could be worse somehow (although I'm sure that would lead to a lawsuit) but it’s also super scary the amount of kids under 13 I’ve been around who say some fiendish stuff.

"age 18+","I’ve played with my daughter to guard her and make sure it was safe. Instead of being safe while playing Adopt Me I have been picked up by someone posing as a child and taken to their private house location. They then “PM” private chatted me and began giving me instructions to take off my clothes and find and put on an underwear outfit. Then began to give graphic sexual instructions. There are multiple games on the Roblox platform that take advantage of children. Their platform is set up to pay off slowly over 15 minute increments to keep the user/child in the game and encourage them to upgrade with spending real money for Robux to buy passes and other hot ticket items. They also encourage them to become premium members because each premium member kept in the game longer is a bigger pay off to the developers. They make a profit off the children from keeping them in the game and from the Robux they spend. They make it difficult for the children to convert what they are actually spending to real dollars because they are not skilled at math and the robux values do not equate to real dollars. The reporting system is weak and the moderators are useless to nonexistent. I’ve reported people for harassment and included screenshots and the reports go nowhere and the harassment continues. If you complain for yourself or child it is just as likely you would be the one penalized so they do not get bad press. Their is a new game called day care where they actually take the clothes off one another and the diapers and are exposed. I have no idea how Roblox considers this okay. My daughters friend plays it and I won’t allow mine in that game or Adopt Me. They are full of adult pedophiles. For some reason there are extensive options for little children to dress up in garters and hose. I do not see the point in having this as an option to 13 yr olds if they are not trying to sexualize them for profit. My daughter plays limited non Roblox games with her classmates now. Thank you for reading. Please be aware. Also, the private message system allows children to have “cyber sex” and I was in a panic one day when two people were talking about going “private” to do that and I was just glad to close the program quickly. The private message system cannot be monitored. They also get around the chat filter all the time for swearing, bullying and sexual behavior by using numbers and spaces in the words. This is not a healthy environment.","Adult"
"age 3+","The game is ok my son said his friends played it but then he came to me and said “the game said it was for kids around the age of 6 and up it looks like a 2 year old lego game.” I checked it out and the moderation was bad. So just don’t let your kids play this. The community is toxic and also the company manipulates many young kids by saying they can make a roblox game and become successful but you have to put hundreds of dollar into advertising your game. sorry about my grammar im typing fast.

Without Roblox I wouldn't be able to provide for my family and help my wife take care of our 3 kids. Roblox has many games but the main one that saved me was ""Da Hood"". The divorce had me wanting to kill myself but Da Hood saved me and my whole family.

"age 10+","My kids have been playing Roblox for a long time. I have mixed feelings about it but found it ok as long as I limit their time on it.
The major problem is that their whole Roblox account has reset back to square one on both of them at different times. (As well as a few of their friends). This has really been a disappointment for them since they spend so much time earning new things on there. When it resets randomly then they have nothing. A major gliche. After this they both decided to never play it again. I would recommend not even bothering with this game. It’s fun for them but has caused a lot of disappointment and sadness for them.","Adult"
"age 10+","The game can affect people socially. You can hide behind a screen and be toxic to people which is bad. But, the games are family friendly for everything on the front page or most games are. There are games known as condo games, which are for 17+, roblox tries to ban these but they get new ones posted which have naked peopel having sex.","Adult"
"age 7+","I am just gonna go over what other parents have to usually say and respond to them on how to fix them in Roblox.
""You can talk to strangers""
Yes you can talk to strangers it is a social app but If you dont want your child talking to random people you can go into the settings, go to privacy then put ""Who can talk to me"" to ""No one""
""People try to date in here""
Yes people do try to date in Roblox but Roblox doesn't like those type's of people and try to get rid of many weird creepy people on their website as soon as possible. If you see a person doing this in-game you can look to the top left corner and click the farthest left button then go to report, Choose the player that is trying to Online Date for Online Dating and report. It's that simple
Roblox is a fun creative app for children, I don't recommend it for kids under the age of seven.
Which ever parent says that you can swear on roblox is talking bull shit. Roblox has a really strict chat system where you can't even say certain words like ""Kissing"" and your account can even get banned if you try to swear. It will tag out if you send a swear message in the chat.
""The games are promoting sexual/adult stuff""
No, They are not. If a roblox game has sex/drugs or other adult stuff Roblox quickly takes them down so nobody can see it. The percentage of your child playing one of those games is a 0.1% chance.
""It has a lot of violence""
They are just lego's. If you don't want your child playing with LEGO swords then I don't know what to tell you. There is guns and other weapons but there is no blood or anything. Roblox games with major gore are usually taken down and you will rarely see them.
Message me on my email: sadeflow13@gmail.com if you have anything you want to say about Roblox and your child if its safe and I will provide you with a quick response because I can assure that Roblox is a safe platform. Thank you for reading this review :)","Adult"

"age 5+","Roblox is a fun game and I let my kids play it but I’ve been seeing unhappy parents complaining and arguing to the Roblox moderators about their poor children getting hacked or scammed, my child got hacked unexpectedly but we got back in luckily and hopefully it’s won’t happen again! Overall Roblox is a entertaining game that brings children so much joy, they spent hours playing on
it, but the thing with getting hacked is that you can spend a major amount of money but once you’ve spent it you can’t get your money back, then if you get hacked later in the future that money is all wasted but of course it’s not your child’s fault so don’t blame them ❤️","Adult"

"age 10+","Roblox is a game where you have to view the dignity of the human person because you have to know that there is a possibility for predators to be on the website. Parents need to be aware who their kids are talking to online on this platform. As the website review states, “We recommend that parents disable the chat functionally as a protective measure when they can’t supervise their kids’ play.” The reviewer also keeps in mind the attitude awareness of online gaming as older kids and even adults are often on the gaming platform. While these games are aimed for kids, many YouTubers play Roblox as a means for entertainment purposes. This is very much motivated and relevant to experience as there have been a few cases with adults trying to contact children. There needs to be a balance between how media creators present Roblox as a game because it is aimed for younger users. This can be obtained through how parents monitor their kids on this website. Furthermore, Roblox is not just a site for online gaming, it is also a chance for developers to show off how skillfully developed they are. They can upload their own games and have other users play it, making it inspiring for younger users to create their own games. Moreover, the review did mention much about it being truth-filled, but implies it through how parents have to protect their children from inappropriate content. By knowing this information, Roblox can be a fun website with the right judgement from the user and the user’s parents.","Adult"

"age 4+","We play as a family on some games, and my four year old enjoys it. She was exposed to is it sooner than I hoped but I have found that for the most part it is pretty innocent. I watch what she’s doing. I tell her to stay away from some game (more “violent” type games). I get worried with her being able to read and participate in the chat room setting but even then I’ll be watching and trust she is using this in a appropriate and safe way.","Adult"
"age 12+","There is nowhere to filter the content if you have younger children playing. What is the point of adding their birthday when they can see all the content for older kids anyway? Restricting the comments is helpful but there are games that 7 years olds just shouldn't be playing on here. They make it seem like it's ok for children of all ages, but it's not.","Adult"
"age 7+","As a parent, my kids love Roblox and play it frequently (When they have the privilege of screen time). I do think it is important to monitor, however, what games your child is playing and who they are interacting with/friending. If you don't want your kid to be able to chat with others, there is a setting to turn it off completely, so your kid can stay safe online. There are also parental controls and if your kid is chatting in games, if their age in Roblox settings is under 13, numbers will be tagged with hashtags. Overall, I would recommend to 7+ as long as you make sure your child is staying safe online and/or using the safety features in Roblox settings.","Adult"
"age 6+","Basically I was told that roblox is a good app for kids to have fun and play games on but that's definitely not the case. My 6 year old son was playing roblox when he ran into a girl and she was 17 years old. She told my son to download an app called ""discord"". They then got into conversations and then when he left for preschool I decided to check my sons Ipad to see what he was doing. This girl sent him her ass and her tits which is totally not ok for a 6 year old to see. I am disgusted with this app and I think no parent should expose their kids to this evil perverted piece of shit app.","Adult"

He responded ""Mum hand over your qwedit karwd I nee to buy the new Phantom Forces ® battle pass bitch"". He punched me in the scrotum and began to nae nae on my corpse. I curled into the fetal position and cried as he kept quoting Peter Griffin from the hit show family guy from Seth McFarlane. The repulsive language he was spouting was intolerable. I already know that the bird is the word. Did you know that the show has been cancelled twice, once following the second season, which caused the show to not air a new episode for a year, and the second (and longest) being between the third and fourth seasons, from 2002 to 2005. The program was the first to be brought back to air due to successful home media sales. But never-mind all that. Later that night I went to his computer and went onto Roblox to see what all the fuss was about. Then I went on one of the places named LGBTQ safe space, they taught me new things about myself.

"age 8+","As a single mom of 2 I think roblox gives a very educational message to kids like how there are games where your kids can get a online job teaching them about the real world.
There is also games like Welcome to bloxburg teaching your kids how to build homes.Roblox has over a million games for kids im sure they can find something they like.
If you are new to roblox there is a thing called robux it is a currency that you can buy using real life money the cheapest is 0.99$ this is so your child can make there own avatars using the catalog this also teaches you kid to be save and helps them use money like they would when they get older.

"age 6+","So the website is good and I rate 6 and up even though it has downsides. A bunch of parents are saying that they are deleting the game from their kids Ipad or such just because a person bullied them or they had sexual manner with a stranger in a condo game.

Either block the user that is bullying your child, or disable chat but monitor your kids so they can have fun and a better childhood.","Adult"

"age 16+","This game is not safe for children unless you as a parent remove their chat features so they cannot see in-game chat at all.
Roblox attempts to censor swearing and inappropriate gameplay but will end up with users bypassing this filter.
Examples of such bypassing and reasons why this game is NOT for children are here;
This is what I, in my 4 years of being on roblox have witnessed.
Sending phone numbers, Sharing snapchats, Sending suicide threats, rape threats, where they live, who they live with, how old they are, online dating, getting a ""boy/girlfriend"", sharing inappropriate images to get an item in a game on Roblox, sharing account details, emails. credit card info, ARRANGING TO MEET UP WITH THEIR ""FRIEND"" / ""BOY/GIRLFRIEND"" FROM ROBLOX IN REAL LIFE BEHIND THEIR PARENTS BACKS.
TD;LR read this vv
If you have a child under the age of 13 turn their chat off or closely supervise them the entire time.
It's not as safe as it may seem, if you've been playing long enough, know enough games, there's nothing child-friendly about it.
There are scams that will take your account, games that are heavily adult 18+ sexual games, games that bypass the swearing filter so you can say ANYTHING. I mean from racial slurs to sexist and homophobic to damn right disturbing.
And some games that are literally the shittest things on this planet, the type of garbage you expect to find in a dollar store!

"age 6+","Hello,
My 10-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter really enjoy ROBLOX. Here are my thoughts on it:
Pros:
It's an immersive experience, very unique
Just like LEGOs! If you've got a kid who's absolutely obsessed with them, this game is for you!
But caution...
Cons:
Scammers
""Pay To Win"" Games
So-called ""Slenders"" and ""Online Daters""
NSFW Games","Adult"
"age 7+","yes","Adult"
"age 2+","i thnk rob;lax is god because peope drink cocain and smoking and drinking and smoking wheat and encouraging kids to rob the bank when they’re older. it also has guns, volience, cursing and blood. i think a new born is able to play this game it it best game every. Roblox also puts a virus in your computer to show your kids how to stay themselves with knifes. Roblox tracks your address and sends kidnappers to kidnap your kids. It’s a great website","Adult"

"age 8+","Roblox is a great game.
Your kids can harness their creativity in this game.
Here's to clarify parental concerns;
Sex: ""My child has been exposed to sex and other adult material!""
You can turn off the chat so your child can only see their friend's chats or nobody's chat at all! If your child is young and doesn't understand the concept of sex and can't see the chat they'll probably think it's just another person with no bad intentions. If you're worried that your child would just turn the settings off, turn the pin on and put in a pin that your child doesn't know about, with this setting if your child wants to change any settings it'll ask for the pin. As long as they don't know or can guess it, your child will be safe.
Language: ""Someone has bypassed the filter and said inappropriate words like f--k or b---h!""
Again, you can turn off the chat so your child only sees their friend's chat or nobody's chat at all!
If you limit their chat to nobody, it can really limit their communication. I suggest limiting it to ""friend's only"" so their friends from school or just people they know in real life can talk to them, if your worried your child will just accept any friend request they received, try checking their account every end of the day (or just periodically) to see if there is a new account you're unfamiliar with, in the morning talk to your child about it and confirm it's the real account of the person they said. If you're also worried somebody will pretend to be your child's friend or family, once again confirm with the person that it is their account.
Safety And Privacy: ""I spent $100 getting Robux for my child's Roblox accounts only for the account to get hacked/terminated for no reason!!"" ""I found a random $200 bill on my bank account for a purchase on Roblox that I did not even make!""
a. Hacking is a huge problem on Roblox's end, but turning on two step verification and turning on the pin can help a lot! Especially if it's your email and the pin isn't as obvious and simple as 1234. Another way people can hack your child is by getting their .roblosecurity cookie, if anybody gets the cookie and pastes it onto a browser, they can get free access to your child's account even if it has two step! The most simple way to avoid this is just by telling your child not to click on links. While most smarter hacks are targeted towards accounts containing millions of Robux in them, it's still better to be careful.
b. Random terminations are also a thing. Roblox is quite weird with their moderation sometimes but you can't really do anything about it. If you have been terminated for a false reason, try to appeal.
c. I've seen a lot of people blame Roblox for random purchases and accused them of ""Hacking my bank account, etc"" the only one you should blame is your kid AND you. If you had parental controls this would not happen and don't turn on automatic payments. Talk to your kid about the concept of money. And if you believe your kid wouldn't do such a thing trust me, if Roblox had really hacked bank accounts it would be all over the news and there would probably be several lawsuits against Roblox.
Violence: ""There's a game called Murder Mystery and it has guns and knives and blood! There's even a shooter called Arsenal!""
This isn't really preventable, as these games are popular and will be recommended to your child by Roblox. If you are worried about how this will affect your child, just because they saw a game with knives and guns in it, doesn't mean they're gonna grow up with guns and knives too. And eventually your kid will be exposed to violence, when they grow up they're not gonna watch cartoons or watch movies about fairytales anymore.
Overral Roblox has it's issues, but with enough monitoring, parental controls, and understanding between the child and parent, you can avoid most of this stuff.","Adult"
"age 7+","This game has awesome messages about teamwork and friendship! Sure there is some bad language in the chat but you can turn off chat in settings. A lot of violence and Lego blood but it’s just Lego! Anyways you can allow your child to only play certain games that you know aren’t inappropriate. So it’s for children 7 and up","Adult"
"age 2+","THIS GAYME IS FOR TEH POOR!!!1111! TIS GAME RUIEND MY ANGL LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11 I CALL POLICE NWO

TIS VERY BAD GEEMA!!!!!! I SUE YOU!","Adult"
"age 10+","Almost exactly like how it was when I was a kid playing this 10 years ago. Parents on this site writing negative reviews are at fault for not doing their research on kids games before letting their kids play them. Monitor your kids. You play stupid games by not doing your research, and you win stupid prizes. Seriously, do better. I'm an adult so I can rate this game high because I'm aware of its mature content.","Adult"
"age 5+","Roblox is a family-friendly game, if you die in roblox you will fall apart like lego and if you try to swear it will hashtag (#####). Ofcourse there are games in roblox where you need to kill but theres no blood or gore and its not that bad. There are ósme really good games in roblox like Adopt me, Bloxburg, Meepcity or Royale High! If someone bullies you in a game in roblox you can always report or block that person.","Adult"
"age 8+","Roblox is a good game in many ways, and the levels of imagination that are seen in this game are spiking! I recommend downloading Roblox because of all the fun games you can play, the people you can meet, and the games you can create. Roblox currently has 199 million active users and continues to grow more and more as more people discover this extraordinary game.
A few games that are engaging and entertaining are Tower of Hell, Royale High, Flee the Facility, and many more. In Tower of hell you are given a tower, full of around 5 stages that you must complete in under 8 minutes. There are obstacles that you must overcome in order to make it to the top but if you fall or touch a kill point you must restart because there are no checkpoints in this game. Many people enjoy racing to the top and some use private servers to practice and get better at playing. In Royale High you’re allowed to roleplay with friends and do different classes in the game. You can also earn yourself diamonds and level up by doing the classes in the school, not only is there a school but there is also a realm that is like a pageant where you dress up to the theme and if you win you earn diamonds and EXP to level up. Finally, Flee the facility you must hack computers and keep away from the beast or else you will be captured and you will have to be freed by another player. The goal of this game is to escape the beast and hack all the computers in order to open the exit doors. You can play this with friends as a fun activity for when you’re bored.
Another great reason why you should download Roblox is because of the many friends you can make in this game. Once you add a friend you are allowed to join their game and play with them more! If you would not like to be the person’s friend anymore all you have to do is use the unfriend button, and if you’d like to re-add them you can simply look their user up and wait for them to accept your friend request. When you make friends online you still have to be careful however roblox has a safe chat that doesn’t allow you to say any bad language, rude things, or inappropriate content. You also can’t send photos of yourself or tell people personal information, so if you find your online friend creepy you can unfriend them right away and they can’t find out any information about you other than maybe your age and your name.
Roblox really sparks your imagination. You are allowed to create your own games, and clothing using Roblox studio and you can earn money by people buying your game passes, clothing, and getting a good rating on your game. This brings me to currency, you can buy Robux to buy gamepasses, clothes, hair, faces, and accessories. There are free things however with Robux you can change your avatar, buy people’s gamepasses, and even buy to enter games. Most games are free to enter and are very enjoyable to play, with lots of different kinds of games. There are over thousands of outfits, accessories, hairs, faces, and more in the roblox catalog to make your avatar the way you want it, with thousands of styles. Most clothes are created by everyday people and with the spark of creativity maybe you can make your own clothing store as well!
With Roblox growing and growing everyday I bet you’d make many memories on roblox. The age groups are mainly younger kids to mid-teens, with a few adults. This really shows that Roblox is for all ages and you’re able to explore with your imagination no matter what age, and for some adults this is a wonderful thing because maybe they miss childhood and wish they had been able to express their creativity to the world when they were young. This also allows young minds to learn that their thoughts and their creativity matters, and that no matter what other people think there are so many more people who enjoy your thoughts and ideas.","Adult"

Roblox says NO WE DO NOT TOLERATE CHILDREN TO USE DEVFORMUMS! For example, you are under 13 in Roblox and you wanted to type a word, but then, it's misspelled, so you say it then it comes up with tags like this #########, I say this, you can't also say some slangs in Roblox such as UGC or IRL, that is bad and shitty Roblox! I say Roblox is a pretty good game for kids, teens, YouTubers, and adults sometimes, and maybe I hope, Roblox fixes their safe chat so you can say more slang, more gibberish, and more numbers!

No, it doesn't at all those games are very un-popular and will never come on your recommended are in the explore page. Yes, it does have the violence that can get extremely brutal but again these games aren't as popular and have disclaimers about the blood. Another thing people say there's swearing this is the stupidest thing if your account is under 13 years old you can't even say ""ok"" without being censored PLUS if someone's account is over 13+ and you're talking to them in-game it'll censor the things that it would regularly censor for you, but it won't censor it for them all in all this game is appropriate for kids I myself am I kid with a 13+ account IT GIVES YOU THE OPTION FOR THIS so even if your kid is 13+ you can still make him under the age limit so don't think this game is bad because other people have said it it's not.","Adult"

"age 8+","While this game can be fun for kids to play, it's important that parents be very involved. Under no circumstances would I allow mine to just play this without some form of supervision.
Parents need to be checking on their kids, know what they're getting into in this game and have good discussions with their children about it often. Here are some concerns parents may or may not have with their children about this game:
1. Violence - Not only that there are guns available, but that other kids of all ages can, and do, bully children by coming to their homes, forcing themselves in, ""killing"" their characters in home invasions, stealing from them, attacking them while on the road and taking their cars, etc. While this may not seem like a big deal to adults, this can be to young children who are bombarded by groups of kids who come in gangs to their homes. Yes, it's a game. Yes, this becomes a bit real to these young children.
2. Language - Swearing, talks of suicide, BLM and other political conversation, sexual conversations including trans, lesbian, gay and other conversation. These situations are in most games, not just the ones specifically for the LBGTQ communities. There are also games in the roblox community specially formatted for the LBGTQ communities, etc and also very violent games. These games are NOT age rated in any way. All children can get into every game unless parents go in and specifically keep their kids from areas they prefer to keep them from. There are also religious games, and although Christian games are few, there are a few calling themselves demonic etc.
3. Clothing - There is some clothing which may not seem appropriate for young children.
4. Bullying - While I addressed this briefly in #1, violence, it's important to note that this also happens among other children bullying each other (girls - girls, etc).
My final take - While Roblox can be a fun community for kids, parents should be aware of the possible downsides and have meaningful talks with their children whenever they play. They should be walking past, at least glancing at what their children are doing while on line, and looking at the conversations. Be aware, have honest conversation and let your child know that if he or she encounters any problems or just has questions about anything, they can come to you. Above all, they should be told to never give out any private information.","Adult"
"age 9+","lets get to the point
-Roblox filter is soo good it is bad to the point where it even censors everyday words like ""hi , k , nice"" and numbers are a no go if ur child in under 13 and it is possible to disable all social aspects of roblox ( why?!)
-The games want robux not roblox it self so just say no if your child wants robux
-near impossible to be bullied ( block them )
- your child wont be scarred for life by someone saying ""noob""
- schools have alot more bullying and swearing but you send them the teachers also punish the kid if they stand up for themselves and let the bully go scott free
-violcence is just falling apart and cartoony stuff
-watch a few roblox youtubers at you will see ( konekokitten, Kreekcraft, Flamingo ( best oone) , jesse games, robuilder, thedevking,)

I told him no because I didn't want to buy anything related to Roblox.

I asked my 14 year old daughter, ""How much does 100000 robux cost""? My 14 year old daughter told me that it costed 1000 dollars. I was very shocked that my own 8 year old son spent that much money for one game. I went to my 8 year old son and took the iPad away from him and told him not to spend that much money on a game and spend my money without my permission.

She loves Brookhaven. For parents who want to turn off chat, you go to the three dots surrounded in a circle at the bottom, hit settings, go to privacy, and turn contact settings off. So roblox is iffy, but good in privacy terms. If your child is under 10, I strongly suggest turning off contact settings. But that is all I have to say!","Adult"

Just yesterday, I peaked at his monitor, and he was playing Roblox. I still hadn't known too much about it, so when I saw that he was in a game with naked characters having, sex. I asked him what he was doing, and he immediately closed Roblox and told me he was doing ""nothing."" This is absolutely disgusting, and this really should not be directed towards kids, but I would say otherwise it's decent. Just monitor your kids and they'll be okay. Just in case though, don't expose this to your younger children, or those who haven't been educated on sex yet, unless you can . The characters look unrealistic and blocky, so don't worry a huge amount, but still be careful.","Adult"

"age 10+","Yeah you know roblox right? But, it's fun you can chat online with strangers, make new friends, playing minigames, and also develop your own game and all the fun of ROBLOX. But, what seems to be the problem? Roblox can be a really good app for children and for too because I'm a children. But, I actually experience and see people doing sex on youtube and on games.. which is actually against the Roblox TOS don't you think? Plus, people bypasses chats thinking they're cool and they can say whatever what they wanna say. (It's mostly copy and paste and slenders says that) Anyways, sometimes it can get a little violence not too much violence like the roblox game piggy.. However, you might get into those things a lot so you may wanna be careful and also (Last one) Many horrible sex games on Roblox is drinking, smoking and drugs. Don't LET your kid play that game because as soon as they grow up they'll be doing bad stuff plus DRUGS and they'll be going to jail if they SELL drugs! Overall, it's a good fine game I guess.. people sends you really nice messages and more. Don't worry! Stay out of those mess and you won't get into trouble.","Parent"

One time when I logged in his account, I joined a game that he often plays which peppa pig chases people and killing them, peppa pig should be kid-friendly.

"age 11+","Hello everyone, I am a roblox YouTuber known as Pink Cow Roblox, but I am not sugarcoating the game I am leaving an honest review.
Now if your child is playing roblox they are most likely playing adopt me, which is a game where you buy and adopt pets which vary in value (examples common, uncommon, rare, ultra-rare, and legendary.) You can also combine pets to make neon and mega pets. This game is pretty much family friendly, but people people scam other players for example someone will change their name to “poor please give me free pets ,” and then someone will give them a free pet even though they aren’t poor.
I’ve also heard people claiming that their child was being “stalked”?Wtf your child is not being stalked on roblox, or any other game. Maybe google the definition of stalking before you say that.
Also roblox censors everything inappropriate.","Adult"

"age 10+","Roblox is a good platform to express creativity and have fun. My 10 year old daughter started playing this game during the pandemic, and I must say, she was quite entertained. There are various types of games here, if your kid loves roleplaying then there are games like adopt me, a game to raise babies and pets, Royale High, a game to dress up and many others. If you kid likes games like Among us, then flicker is an option. If your kid likes shooting games, then there are games like arsenal. Occasionally, there will be people who bypass the in built filter, which prevents swearing or sm*t , but that happens rarely, and if it does happen the chances of your kid getting such a game recommended are pretty low, because if the roblox moderators find such a game, it would be deleted in a jiffy. The only problem is scamming, because there are a lot of scammers in this platform. This means that the chances of your kid's account getting stolen are high. which would make them extremely sad. So I think children should be given a lesson to trust no one and should be emotionally strong to play on this platform.","Adult"

"age 18+","Parents NEED to know that there is a VERY dark side to Roblox. There are ""condo"" and ""scent"" games that will take the kids to inappropriate servers. Kids under 13 are being targeted and invited to these servers as well. The servers have dance parties, shower parties and dark corners of houses where the characters get naked and eventually have simulated sex. Sometimes Rape, Gang Rape and Group Sex is present. I am horrified that this isn't more moderated. The games tend to get taken down but they're like rabbits and then 4 more appear. Honestly, if I had known ANY of this was even remotely possible I would have never allowed my daughters to play this game.","Parent of a 14-year-old"

"age 7+","I, personally think that you should allow your children to play it, because most parent reviews are harsh and the parents haven't even given the game a chance- or even tried playing it for themselves.

Yes, there are hackers sometimes but they get banned before something bad happens, also there is a currency called robux which is for passes in games and things that you can customize your avatar with.
This website does have games with violence but almost none include blood, For example, Arsenal is a good gun game that is good it has plenty of content and there are many characters or emotes you can choose for the people who like role play there is lots of games to do that

While he went to the bathroom, I went into his room to check what this game was all about. I joined a game called 'Murder Mystery 2' on his iPad and saw this. There were people online dating and using numbers to bypass curses. There were bots sending links, and people with inappropriate avatars. As well as that, the purpose of the game was to run around with a knife stabbing others, or to run from the killer.

"age 8+","Roblox is a great game for kids 8 and up. A lot of the reviews on this site say 18+, but that's a huge exaggeration. I do agree that there are a lot of ways around the chat filter, but swearing is not a big problem on Roblox. I also agree that there is a lot of pay to win in some games. There are also reviews saying that the devs don't read player reports. They do read player reports, but they only read the ones with video/photo evidence.","Adult"
"age 15+","The only reason I downloaded this was because my little girls (ages 10, 9, and 7) said their friends played it and I got recommendations from other parents I knew saying that it was educational (sometimes) and fun, so I downloaded it for my girls on their Ipads. But from that moment on, I realized I had made the wrong decision. First off, the game has a chat where you can talk with other people. HUGE no- no in our house. Secondly, I was just really mad. So, what I ended up doing was that I confiscated all the Ipads -I took all the games that had any potential online chatting in them. The Ipads are completely gone. I'm just- so against that. I feel like it's such a mess to play any type of game where you can chat with other people. It just- makes me mad that they even have those types of games for people to download- let alone children. Anyway, that's why I'm trying not to have my little girls use their Ipads at all because I feel like it is not necessarily a safe thing to play with all the time. Anyway, I'm happy I did that, but I feel like I have to check them all the time. I'm constantly checking them to make sure that there's nothing that I haven't allowed them to download that I don't approve of. I'm happy I took the Ipads away because I like my kids being regular kids. I love it. They're playing outside more, they're riding their bikes more. It led to some tears, but my little girls eventually got over it. This is not an app I recommend.","Adult"

"age 6+","If you child understands what a scam is and stays in games with 50+ players your child should be fine. There is a in game chat which is heavily monitored for example if you type 1 it comes out as # and many other things. If you child grows up around this they might grow into creating the games which involves coding/math/modeling. There is something called ""robux"" which I found my kid at the age of 8 spent in about 2 days, but as your child grows if they buy robux it will last longer. If your child chooses to develop games they will probably want someone to help them to find someone to help them I would recommend discord as there are discord servers made for finding other developers discord. If your child's game is successful enough they them selfs could earn robux from other people buying it in the game. And if your child's over the age of 13 you can turn that into real money(don't count on this though)","Adult"
"age 6+","I've been playing Roblox for over 10 years and I can definitely say that it is one of the best games of all time (In my opinion). You can find a game that will suit you for sure as there are millions of games and hundreds of talented game developers of all different interests. You can never get bored of Roblox because of all of these amazing games that are all available for FREE!
There will be games which are against the rules but these get removed quickly (Scented cons) and these games can only be found if you really go looking for them so no need to worry about that. If you need to, monitor what your child is doing and don't blame Roblox for any hacking, scamming or inappropriate content, blame the players who do this as Roblox keeps things like this from happening the best of their ability, they are constantly working on fixing these issues within the game to protect the children playing so that they can have a good, child-friendly platform to be on which parents can trust.","Adult"
"age 7+","So right now or at one stage your kid(s) have probably played Roblox and some might say it is bad or good but I am in between as a Roblox player myself
GAMES
I have seen a lot of Roblox games and not to say they are all good.I would monitor what your kid(s) Are playing some games like Adopt me! Restaurant tycoon 1 and 2 and a few others are family friendly but some like Piggy, the asylum and banana eats are more horror and maybe M rated so maybe check what your kid(s) are playing there is a continue playing category and that has around 10 to 15 games that your kid(s) have recently played
CHAT
So in Roblox they have in game and chat options and yes Roblox has chat filters and they are really on top of keeping chat clean but some players might figure out how to bypass chat filters and say some pretty mean and explicit things and for parent(s) or carer(s) that would like to stop your child chatting or seeing chat you can disable it in the settings and I believe that is the same with the in game chat
FRIENDS
In Roblox your kid(s) are bound to get a few friend requests from time to time some might be legitimate children but some as we know it could be predators but unfortunately you cannot disable your kid(s) friending abilities but you can check who they have friended and unfriend the and if needed block and or report them
ROBUX
Robux is a in game currency and usually used to buy clothes for their avatar or in game advantages and if your kid(s) are desperate for Robux they may head to out of game websites or download apps that say they give free Robux and they will 90% of the time ask for their username or password and that will usually lead to having their account hacked. Another “use” for Robux is to get children to do things that they don’t want to do for instance trade or sell their most valuable item or friend them or get personal information.
SUMMARY
So I cannot stress enough please be aware of what your kid(s) are viewing or doing on Roblox but not to say that there a lot of bad things in Roblox just be careful by the way this whole review was written by a 12 year old
Take care and be safe!","Adult"

Also people will commonally bypass the filter to say hell, ---t, **c*, etc. Finally people ask to exchange private info to meet up in real life. 3 royalle high kids pretend to be teenagers and have sex. There are some better games. 1 piggy where you have to work as a team to escape a map in a distopian future where people get infected with rabies and you have to escsape them while in an escape map with a team. 2 arsenal teaches kids fine motor skills and team work as well as thinking in the moment. arsenal has you attacking another team to get 32 wins and you win. 3 jailbreak kids learn how to work as a team and indipendent escapeing cops or chasing criminals to make money. roblox is a game with many sides some good some bad.","Adult"
"age 6+","Ok, I have read reviews of other parents, and their reviews can only be described in one word: STUPID. I mean, why bother to complain about the game when there are literally parental controls. Like seriously it seems like they were made by morons that don't know how to spell or made by 5-year-old kids. seriously if you don't want your kid to play this game, just tell them to stop playing it, you bunch of idiots. And other parents say to have their kids play GTA instead of Roblox which I don't think is a good idea. And if their scores are dropping set a goal and only let them play if they have reached this goal for heaven's sake. I am more concerned about the parent's spelling than my kids playing Roblox.","Adult"

"age 8+","Roblox is a good game. It is a kids game that lets other people communicate. Recently my kids got the game. They are addicted and will do anything to play it. They spend their free time playing this game. But I will take away their Ipads and they will be okay with that. One day I decided to try it myself. I made an account and my kids taught me how to play. I felt like I made a good connection with them. I played some games like Adopt Me, Royal High, and Work at A Pizza Place. The games were really fun but beware that some games are not ""kid-friendly"". There are games like Jailbreak where you rob banks and I don't think that should be on Roblox. I realized that there is something called ""Roblox Studio"" where you can create games and publish them on the Roblox website. I heard it was educational and you can ""program"" games. Roblox is sometimes educational. There is one game called ""Parking panic"" which is educational. I rate Roblox a 4 out of 5.
My son watched the following Youtubers:

"age 7+","Here is my short explanation on how Roblox works:
(I have a long explanation after)
Roblox is open for all ages, although I would recommend it to be 7+.
Anyone can create a game and publish to Roblox, which means if you see any suspicious things on Roblox, it's not Roblox's fault.
Anything can be added in people's games on Roblox, but only by the developer(s).
There is a moderation system and parental controls, although some people are able to bypass the moderation system.
Your child can edit their virtual avatar.
Your child can send and accept friend requests from people.
There is a currency on Roblox called Robux which can be exchanged for things on the Avatar Shop or in the games themselves.
People who've been accepted into the UGC Program can create virtual avatar accessories, but anyone can create shirts and pants.
You can make a Roblox group to assign games to and to sell merch on.
Make sure to check if your kids are doing the right things on this platform, perhaps check on them and their account frequently.
Below is my lengthy explanation on how Roblox works...
Roblox is NOT a game. It's a platform to create games and play other people's. Unfortunately, the only way to create a game is to do it on a PC, because the game creator ""Roblox Studio"" is a bit too much for mobile devices. All the games on Roblox are made by real people, and although Roblox tries hard to moderate their platform, there will obviously be some dodgy games made by some dodgy people. There are helpful parental controls to limit what your children can do, and a built-in moderation filter which, when old enough, gets less strict (but still does not tolerate swearing etc.) You can customise your own virtual avatar to use in these games, but some games are clever enough to allow you to create a custom character in these games. Of course, Roblox can't prevent this as most of the games on the platform are created by others. Your child can send and accept friend requests with anyone, so make sure to check their friends list to see if they've been friending strangers. If you see your child spending some sort of currency, it is most likely a currency that a developer has created in their online game. Roblox also its own currency called ""Robux"" which can be bought for real money. Developers can utilise this Robux feature to create anything in their game to cost Robux. Roblox is also a platform to create clothing, as many hats, waist accessories, hairstyles etc. are made by people who have been accepted into Roblox's ""UGC Program"" which allows users of Roblox to create custom accessories. Anyone, though, can create clothing such as shirts and pants (with a little fee of Robux) to sell. Roblox also has a subscription called ""Roblox Premium"" which allows players to gain monthly Robux and any built-in premium features that developers have added to their assets. You can also make a Roblox group for 100 Robux to assign games to, and to bring people together. Merchandise can also be sold in groups. This is a completely safe platform that, even if it has some suspicious people, you should not worry about your kids having.","Adult"
"age 16+","To be honest, when you think of Roblox you think of unharmful fun for kids but I recently encountered my child's obsession with a game called 'allstar tower defence'.
This is a tower defence game that allows kids to work together to beat waves of bad guys. I started to notice my kids desire, and frustration to beat one wave which he insisted on buying a character (that you cant buy outright but have to gamble robux for). Then eventually the character cost him £10.00.
Parent should be aware that Roblox has massive buy bait included in it. Much like fortnite its aimed at kids that need to impress their friends. Think vanity. I was utterly disgusted that a person can create a game so popular and then goes on to seemingly insist on buying in-game upgrades (subtly) in order to proceed.
I honestly think there is a lot of hook and con going on with this game. With this tower defence game I tried to reason with my son on thinking strategically with his friends to beat the bait. I tried to get him to get out of the 'I MUST BUY THIS' trail of mind.
My kid suffered frustration week on week and had already spent £30 of his pocket money trying to get the only character but didnt get the one he wanted. He waited a month and finally got it. As it progressed he was tempted with further baiting to buy.
Roblox isnt doing a good job of this at all. Its part of a wider problem of baiting kids to spend money on meaningless purchases. What makes me sick about this tower defence game is that its popular that is not being regulated and is likely feeding some guy on yacht somewhere. Laughing all the way to the bank because of people like me who grant their kids pocket money only to be spent on crap.
I have banned this game. I dont think its morally right that my kid is a constant victim of scams. I feel its best to educate my child on this kind of thing. Its just exploitation of children and its massively wrong on so many levels.
When you approach your child wanting to play this game be aware that it promotes/enforces addictive in-game purchases (as above) and in latest news doesnt have enough controls to prevent some really dark crimes.
Im very sickened by my childs desire to buy buy buy just to get to level 2. Disgusting and Roblux needs to sort this out.
Approach with caution other parents. This my experience and education is needed.","Adult"

I wouldn't be worried about innaprpriate dialoge due to the fact that roblox tags out all sus communication, were things like: ""I'm 12 years old"" look like: ""## ## ##### ###"" If you feel too tight with your kid than you can put on a filter that doesn't allow them to talk to other players or say anything themselves","Adult"

Before all of this I gave him robux he bought a very satanic item called the Golden Monstrosity. I had to take it off of his avatar IMMEIATLEY before demons come out of his computer and take over his body. I couldn't believe my own son would put himself in this much danger.

"age 9+","I would recommend this to kids 9 and up. This is a great website if your kid knows what you are doing.
You might be wondering - Why recommend this? There are online daters, violent games, scams, etc. Roblox does SOMETIMES remove bloody games, but some are still in roblox for some reason. You just have to teach your kids how to deal with certain situations.
Some situations are listed here:
Roblox Scams: When your daughter/son makes an account, make sure to put 2FA verification on the device with your email on it. Therefore, if your child falls for a roblox ""Robux"" game scam the scammer won't be able to enter their account.
Gore/Blood Games: They are just transparent red squares/circles. Always be able to check what they play every night to make sure they aren't playing gore games.
Online Daters: Your child can just walk away from them or leave the game. It's that simple. Just inform your child that.
I have a 10 year old daughter who has been playing roblox for 4 years now (2017 - 2021). She is mature, knows about all of the things on roblox and she knows what she has been doing. If she sees an online dater, she walks away. If she has a problem with roblox, she goes to Roblox Support and tells me that she sent an email.
Again, it all depends if your child knows what they are doing on roblox.","Adult"

ROBLOX doesn't get hacked often plus it has a strong secure network so dont worry about anyone stealing your cookies unless you give it to them.","Adult"

"age 6+","Roblox is a safe place. If you are worried your child is doing inappropriate things, Roblox has parental controls for that. if some player is creeping you out, you can just block them. and if your child is spending your money, why the heck do they know your credit card info!!!! That's your fault. Granted your child may be bullied, but this is the internet you cant expect everyone to be nice. now lets see the final problem is that kids can get addicted. i should know as i am addicted but i can manage myself. parental controls can kick your child off the website after a certain amount of time. The reason i am saying 6 and up is that a 6 year old can see a scam and not give their password and get hacked. Overall the only problem is that some parents just do not understand tech. Ik its rude for a 12 year old to tell you how to parent but this is just common sense people! don't give your child your credit card/apple pay/app store info! if you see your kid play bad games, just turn on parental controls!","Adult"

"age 5+","First of all, Roblox is a safe platform. For people under 13 years old, it has parental controls that allows you to turn off chat, see what games they play, and avoid any communication with strangers. There is also a chat filter on Roblox. For people under 13, they will censor ""swears"" like stupid, idiot, etc. They also censor numbers. For people over the age of 13, the filter is a little less restricted but still in place. ""swears"" like stupid, and idiot are uncensored, but for all players some sentences are blocked like where do you live, or how old are you, etc.
Compared to Minecraft, which has hardly any filtering, Roblox is one of the most safe and fun platforms on the internet.
There will be a point where you may come across a ODER (Online Dater) or a exploiter (hacker). Oders are fairly simple to avoid. Just walk away from them, or report them through Roblox's reporting system. Exploiters do not harm players. They insert code into any Roblox game and it gives them an unfair advantage over normal players. Exploiters are generally there to annoy people and you can also report them. Exploiting is against Roblox's Terms of Service and is terminated quickly.
There is hardly any violence within Roblox. When your avatar dies, heshe just breaks into pieces. Inappropriate games that your child plays SHOULD NOT be blamed at roblox, it was you child who searched up for it.
Done with all the explaining for all those overreactive parents out there, now onto roblox as a whole.
Roblox is a incredible platform where you can make friends with other people. Games like Piggy and Murder Mystery 2 encourage people to use strategy, and teamwork. Role-Playing games like Welcome to Bloxburg, Robloxian Highschool, etc gives children a sense of what it's going to be like when they have a job, their own house, etc. Tycoons like Restaurant Tycoon 2, Theme Park Tycoon, and Tiny Town Tycoon encourage creativity and building, as well as to running some sort of business like a restaurant, a theme park, or a city. Roblox Studio (side app) and the game Lua Learning teaches people to code, and make their own games. All roblox games are made from Roblox studio, so your child can make their own game, and share it.
In conclusion, Roblox is a amazing platform for people to make friends, learn to code, and explore the unlimited worlds and genres in Roblox.","Adult"

"age 18+","One time my son was playing a game called Piggy, and a creepy pig that could stand up attacked him with a baseball bat! A different time, my 5 year old daughter WAS ONLINE DATING SOMEONE IN ""Survival the Jeff Killer"" or something! Not to mention the avatars! In this game, you can be shirtless! Girls can even wear CROP TOPS!! I do not want either of my children to be subjected to anything in this appalling game. Terrible, and would not recommend to anyone, except for Jacob across the street. He is 19 years old and loves all things horror.

"age 9+","I think that all of you, parents, that think that ROBLOX is a violent game... it is not... Yes, there are some games in roblox with violence but roblox said it is kind of 13+ game so yeah... And also there is bullying but you have the leaderboard and you can block players. And, yes, robux do cost money but look at it, 400 robux is only 4.99$. And your kid can be very happy with it.","Adult"

Roblox has put so many barriers in place to make sure their minors are safe. Roblox has done so much more then any other community run platform. And if one mistake goes by, the media and parents IMMEDIATELY go for Roblox. The media only says this for clout and putting news out there.

"age 6+","As a person who has been playing Roblox since 2013, I would say the game is ages 6+. There are some shady players, for example ones who try to bypass the chat (I don't normally see those though), or play some really loud and explicit audios (Depends on what game you're playing, and if it allows players to play music). Now to the privacy and security part. If you have a 6 - 8 year old playing, I suggest turning off their chat, you can do so by going to settings, click privacy, and there should be an option to turn off their chat. And since there is an option to add other players by either accepting their friend request or sending them one, tell your child to not add random people, but add people from school and things. If you have a child 9 - 13, allow them to be able to chat to others, but still remind them that they shouldn't add random people. If you want to turn their chat back on, you can go back to settings, privacy, and click on that option again. If you have a child that is 14 - whatever age, let them be able to chat, add some people that they trust, and much more. As they known a lot more. If you buy your 6 - 13 year old child robux, which is the games currency, I suggest going to settings, and then adding your email so that if they ever get hacked (higher chance when they are younger) you can go to your email, check your inbox for a message from roblox asking if you want to revert the account back so, when clicking that it will ask you to make a new password, make one that is unique. If you want even more privacy, you should go to settings, then security and click on the option for 2 -step verification. That means that ever time someone tries to log in, you will get an email with a code, and you can enter the code and get into the account. Now to the games part. You can have your children play many games, but there are some shady games including places where you can say anything, and condos. To that, I suggest checking up on your child every 15-30 minutes so they aren't doing anything bad. You can also buy game passes with robux, which gives your child an advantage. And for the avatar part, your child can spend their robux on avatar items, they can buy hairs, clothing, hats, shades, and more. That's about it with my roblox review.","Adult"

"age 11+","Hello Parents,
You might know that Roblox is a very popular and known online game around the world. Around March of 2016, my 8-year-old son asked me if I could let him create an account and play around with his friends since his favorite Roblox YouTubers KreekCraft, RussoPlays, and Poke were playing and also his friends were so I let him and gave him 1,000 Robux to keep. I told him that I would give him a weekly allowance so he could use it on his Roblox Premium subscription. I created an account for myself so I could monitor him here and there. One day, I found him dating a girl from Roblox without my own consent so I grounded him for a week. I researched more and found out that there were a lot of kids dating on Roblox using MeepCity and Adopt Me! I wasn't too crazy about it but I taught him some lessons about 'How to be safe online. ' so next time he wouldn't be doing bad stuff online. As he grew older, he didn't do anything bad on the site until around his 7th to 8th grade year. He started to talk to random strangers using the chat feature and he and the strangers were planning to meet at this club. He used my CC to pay for Robux and the Premium subscription. (Total Price= $219) Not only that, but he started to talk back to me, he got suspended from school with his friends because they were playing Roblox on the School computer during school hours. I completely restricted his computer by putting screen time, monitoring apps, and safe search. After 10th grade, I let him make his own decision on what he wants to do online but I won't help him out since he was old enough. I would love to thank a few news stations and a few Roblox YouTubers to show me which games are good and bad.
I will list a few issues and a few good things about Roblox:
The bad things:
Addiction
Rudeness from your son/daughter
Dating and Oders
A little bit of violence but not TOO much
A few games which features crime
Toxicity within Fans and Games
That's a few of the issues about Roblox.
Here are the games that are bad or just okay:
Jailbreak/Mad City (features crime but okay for over 10+)
Adopt Me/Meep City (Oders and dating)
The Streets 2 (Gang Related)
Phantom Forces 2/ MM2/ Arsenal (A little bit of violence and guns)
Condo Games (The worst of all of them. Lots of inappropriate stuff)
Best things about Roblox:
The community is kinda good.
Amazing Ui and easy navigation
Good Customer Service
Amazing Game Devs
Language Support
Etc.
Best games on Roblox:
A few simulators games but not all
Hide and Seek Extreme (A better version of the classic IRL game)
Epic Minigames
Booga Booga (Teaches survival skills)
Etc. (There's more)
Some very good RBLX YouTubers:
KreekCraft
RussoPlays
TheCrew
ItsMatrix
Seniac
ThinkNoodles
Terabrites
Etc.
Thank you parents for looking at my reviews.","Adult"
"age 10+","Do not bother allowing your kids to access this game site. Not unless you like consoling children when their accounts or game progress gets glitch or hack and they lose everything. Reporting it to the admins is a complete waste of time because no one will ever contact you. It is a shame because they solicite money via ROBUX which is a disgrace because they do no monitor or fix issues. A serious company that should be open to a Class Action Suit and shut down.

"age 2+","This game is seriously the best! My child plays Roblox with me all the time! Me and my child love this game and I would recommend it to other parents out there! Today we played Blending Simulator and it was super fun! So to all parents out there, sign your child up!

"age 7+","My daughter aged 8 had her account suspended for a week because she typed in the chat "" h ell"".
A group of players also got into a chat war with one group typing ""all lives matter"" and the other ""no lives matter.""
My daughter joined in and typed the former.
For this they suspended her account for 7 days!
For a first time offense from an 8 year old who had no real conception of what she was typing.
Others involved merely received warnings!
Then the horror of trying to appeal the decision began.
A guy called Arturo replied to my request for an appeal after 36 hours, asking me to send the request from the email account we use to spend $50 a month on Roblox from.
I duly did this.
24 hours later I received another message requesting the same thing before they'd address the suspension.
We're now six days in, a very depressed little girl in lockdown, her account suspended for no real reason and no means of appealing it.
If there are any media outlets wanting this, feel free to use it.
Absolutely outrageous from Roblox

"age 7+","With roblox, your kid learns to explore an online world, make friends, and build their own creations! Now before you come over and go like ""What about games with violence?"" Tell your kids to not go in games like murder mystery. Talking about pedophiles? Just have your kids not go to the ""condo"" games which are the games pedophiles typically hang around.

"age 18+","My 13 year old son likes to play roblox, but I never really knew what it was. One day, I decided to watch his screen as he played. He was playing a game called welcome to bloxburg, where you build houses. Someone built a house in the game that looked like a strip club, and had pictures of naked women on the walls! Everyone in the game was swearing, despite my son promising me that there was a filter in the chat. I told him he has to leave the game, and if I catch him playing that game again he is grounded. So then, he joined a game called ragdoll engine.. which is basically a death simulator. You climb to high heights and jump off cliffs, and people can push you. I am not letting him play this game either, so he got out and joined a game called Broken Bones, which I was absolutely disgusted of. The point of the game was to jump off cliffs and die. It is also very graphic, with blood everywhere. My son is never playing roblox again. I was also annoyed about how bad the chat filter is. It doesnt filter enough. People were able to type numbers if you typed something before it, and they were using altered versions of swear words so that roblox would let them say it. And the prices for robux, the in game currency are too high. We should not have to spend this much money on such a horrible game for our children to be happy.","Adult"
"age 8+","Customer service is non-existent. Cannot be reached by phone. The ""contact us"" forms get you boiler plate emails that do nothing to resolve problems. My young niece made some unauthorized purchases. When I requested cancellation of the charges they closed her account. No recourse, despite long history of use with many legitimate purchases that presumably benefited the company. I did get the charges refunded through the payment method source, not Roblox. But what kind of business cuts you off from access to legitimately purchased items if you request a refund of unauthorized charges?
The games seem fun, but buyer, beware. I would prefer not to deal with a business whose policies are unfair to the customer.","Adult"

This is very scary as all of your information and your child's information is wide open for anyones taking.

"age 7+","I can see why Common Sense rates this for 13+ some of the games are for older kids, however, there are alot of games that are more appropriate for younger kids. My biggest concerns are the safety and privacy. The settings are ""all"" or ""Nothing"" with Roblox. Other people can add you as a friend, you have to go in and ""unfriend"" each on individually. In order to be able to chat with a friend the chat opens up for anyone to chat with you, you can't turn off the other people without turning off actual friends.
We've also found with our kids that because these are open games and made by anyone, the titles are misleading. My daughter has come across more than one that ended up being more horror, and certainly not appropriate for you. But because she opened it once, it stays up on her main dashboard a a recent game until she plays enough games for it to go away, there are no controls to block a game at all. And when you change the settings to lower the age group, she ends up with a tiny number of games to play. Again, its an all or nothing. Block almost every game, or all of them are left accesible.
In short, she is very limited when and if we let her play. She finally had a friend that she could play with, but now that will have to go away once we found out that anyone could chat with her (and there were alot of chats on there initiated by other people even when we had it turned off).
My daughter loves being able to design her avatar, playing the hide and seek games and many others, but its very risky when it comes to safety and privacy. This is not a game unless you are a parent who can monitor it every minute they play.","Adult"
"age 12+","I have literally seen children tell other children to go kill themselves on Roblox and there is nothing to stop them doing so. I've even seen them give instructions on how to do so and these children haven't been banned. There is nothing to hold these kids accountable for their actions. At least with games like Minecraft, they have an account that has been bought and can be traced. This is why it's harder for kids to do harm to others. On Roblox there's nothing to stop them from doing illegal activities if they use a VPN and kids as young as 8 are smart enough to do this. You can make an account with out an email, with out permission from parents and that is where this issue begins. Swarms of kids use hack clients to abuse to attack and steal and because they can use these fake throw away accounts, they get away with their actions. There is little to no moderation on any of the games or from the owners of Roblox. If they want things to change they need to start using ID to sign up accounts. It would stop their hack client issue, it would stop their swarms of abuse and it would start to hold children and their parents accountable for things that happen on these games. At the moment kids have said they hate how they can barely type as everything is auto moderated. You wouldn't need auto moderation if people had to sign up through an ID system. If a child does something extremely bad, an email could be sent to their parents with details of what was said and done. Some kids aren't going to like this though because it means they can't get away with the rampart abuse that is Roblox. The game is completely overrun with abuse, attacks, hack client users and personal information botts designed to get your kids accounts hacked. Roblox staff need to implement changes as their game has slowly become the internet toilet in games aimed at kids but loaded with harassment, abuse and illegal activity. In the late 2000s this game had a great community, My son even had a game which still is active and has many visits. Since then this game has become something horrible and now my older son is attending University he has asked his younger siblings not to play. They all have steam accounts now and we give them money to purchase games they may enjoy when they are doing well in school. I wish Roblox could return to a point where children are protected and safe.","Adult"
"age 6+","so i was making a game(free models) and i joined it to test it and it said something pretty much scary: you need 450 more robux to buy shirt faceless head..
i clicked cancel,but it kept asking,and then,i heard growling sound,maybe a bear,i knew what i had to do,i unplugged my mic and left the game and browser.
I joined another game to see if it is a virus or someone hacking and believe it or not...it was not there,it is only in my game,so i decided to just leave it for now to try and fix it with my team of friends,i will edit this review and let you know what happened next...","Adult"
"age 11+","so this game is very good, and your kid can make his/her own game!
so i logged on and i got an account and bought some robux with real money! but I think it's 11 years and up because it has swearing.
Thank you!","Adult"

"age 7+","I don't know how many attentive parents are involved in the design of Roblox's parental control, but it's basically 'all or nothing'. First, I want to say I started Roblox with my kids only 2 weeks ago after being recommended by other parents. My child picked two games, 'The Dinosaur Zoo' and 'Princess Tycoon'. Dinosaur Zoo was buggy but it's fine. Now about Princess Tycoon--I don't like princesses but I thought, it couldn't be too bad. Turn out that game completely threw me off so bad that I don't recall anything nearly as bad in my entire parenting experience. So the first day I taught my kid to build up her 'tycoon', and there are, surprisingly, weapons. Which I thought was somewhat OK; besides, the death of a character looks like legos falling apart. On the second day, there's this other player came harassed my daughter multiple times by going into her home killing her. That's kind of fine, I taught her about bullying and cyberspace, that's just a character that respawns. On the third day, oh my heaven this other player has a weapon that paralyzes and made my daughter's avatar to kneel down, and they proceeded to use a machete to behead her avatar. I was completely shocked beyond comprehension. They made it so the whole act is zoomed in too. People my age probably associated this with the terrorist acts we saw on TV, but luckily my child was just frustrated that she had to wait helplessly to see her character get destroyed. I then tried to stop the game to have a conversation with her, but holy whatever exclamation I can use here, the other player came again, and this time after shooting my daughter's character paralyzed kneeling, they zoomed in again and put a gun on her head point blank and waited 3 seconds before shooting it in the head. My daughter was frustrated but she was attached to the 'tycoon' she spent time and effort building. Eventually, I decided that I wanted to only allow games I checked to be played, but Roblox does not allow that. When parental restrictions are on, you only get a selection of games picked by Roblox, they say the criteria is guns. For example, the Dinosaur Zoo wasn't included, even though it involves no guns and no attacking, destroying, or killing of anything at all. Overall, Roblox makes it sound like they care about parental control, but they don't. And their support is horrible. Their responses are just links to documentation you've already seen. They also don't seem to support small devs and contributors. For example, people stealing costumes from other sellers and sell them in their stores with no consequences, dev accounts being hacked and Roblox won't provide appropriate support, probably thinking the victims are just kids.","Parent of a 5-year-old"

"age 10+","ROBLOX is an amazing game i love to play, bad business and other games like build a boat, a bunch of fun games you can play with your friends, but then i wanted to change my avatar and make it look nice but i kept looking then i saw something that said ""limited U"" and those things are EXPENSIVE its costs up to 15 million robux to 20k! I love the game but make these items cheaper for other people who want to get the same thing, by the way robux is in game currency. thanks!","Adult"
"age 11+","I think ROBLOX is a fun and interesting game but there are some things that are not very nice. first there is virtual online dating which is against rblx rules another thing is cyberbullying ive seen other call other players names and ive seen people trying to curse! And i took my childs ipad last night and tried reporting someone and reports dont rlly do anything! Others trying to share their private info. But i mean overall if your children can handle things like this or ignoring it they will enjoy it","Adult"
"age 18+","I let my kid play this game, it was free and looked okay so I let my kid get it but I regret all of it! later that day I saw a charge for 800 ""Robux"" that cost 10$! The next day he was playing games called prison life and jailbreak about robbing banks and escaping prison!!!!!! and get this he played for 30 minutes and did not read his 5 hours of reading only 4.5!!!!! I'm so mad! I made an account to see how this was happening oh my gosh it was terrible there was ""free Robux"" games where you had to enter your password and after you did you would lose your account and games where people swore!!! Not to mention the people dating in roblox!!!! 1 star!","Adult"
"age 10+","after your kid plays this game for a while it might become addictive. Not even just for kids YouTubers get all rapped up in it and there is different types of games but if you parents do not want your kids looking on it I think there is a kid filter on it but if not you have to supervise it. KEEP YOUR CHILDREN AWAY FROM CHAT!!! I know that it stars out any unregnised words but not the bad words or some people call ""mean words"" and that is fine but be carful with the chat kids.","Adult"
"age 8+","My son has been playing ROBLOX for over 4 years, and it seems fine. As long as you are monitoring your child, it is great. I tried it for myself, and stumbled upon some cool creations. One user created an AI chatbot which talks with the player and another user made an obstacle course where the player jumps from platform to platform to reach a ""Winners section"". The only questionable thing is the death animations, a cartoony breaks into pieces as if they are a piece of glass falling and shattering. Aside from that, Its a great game.
One suggestion for whoever made ROBLOX (EA, Microsoft, whoever made it), Some games should be restricted until a user reaches the required age to play. For example, the game ""murder mystery 2"" a game where the user is a hero with a gun or a murderer with a knife, should be restricted until the player is at least 13 years of age. I think games have to be moderated and approved before they can be recommended to under 13 users.
Overall great game, Parents are overreacting. As long you as you keep an eye on your child, they are safe.","Adult"

"age 5+","My two kids have this app and they play on it TOO MUCH. My two daughters are 9 and 10. They LOVE to play games that involve pets or Royalty. Like Royale High of Adopt me. But, the games made them rotten to the core. The now scam and like to ""trust trade"" other players. I talked to them about this and told them that scamming people is bad. They even stole my money to buy ""robux."" There are some pros. I made my own account and I ended up liking the game. Scammers and exploiters you can block them and avoid them. After a few months my daughters realized scamming was bad after the Developers of each game saw what they were doing.

"age 18+","Hello everyone who is out there with children who is playing this game I repeat take it how you want but this app is very dangerous and it really causes brain abuse to kids , my baby sister is a victim to this game she has been playing it constantly .. nights after nights she never sleeps but me and my family didn't notice how she was reacting to this game we kinda just let her play it because we feel like it was a good game to play and keep her mind off other things. She is only 11 years old and since she been playing this game for the past 8 months her level of reading , comprehension has been on a kindergarten level , she says words like "" you're such a loser"" or she would just repeat her words in scrabble like it makes sense and after every convo she would go in a blank and start back saying it again and she would say ""so yeah.. yeah"". This game is really stressful on her its like she gets in altercations with different people every other day , they say they will come to where she stay and come fight her mind you these kids are in different states and the language is so foul kids 10 years old cursing like they are 45 and its just pathetic ... my baby sister has lost all her hair on her head , and her eyebrows and eyelashes due to this ROBLOX game that is supposed to occupy these kids during this pandemic .. she feel like its okay to be on this game all night long literally until the sun rise its sad that she doesn't even have a way of thinking I asked her what would she do if she could be on earth for the first time she said ""idk"" or ""nothing"" most days she would break out in tears because she has to do school work or even clean up and do her chores but she becomes happy when she has her tablet in her hand and is on Roblox its crazy her nerves are bad she will walk around the house bitting her nails and just shutting her self down like she has anxiety she is afraid of leaving the house she feels people from the game is after her this is so heart breaking seeing her become a victim of a virtual world that she think is real she have people saying they would want to be adopted and they want other kids to be their parents and they also date on this game and get each other number and try to link up its saddening ... I just want to say this game should be band and discontinued","Adult"
"age 2+","This game has no problems at all. In fact, Roblox helps children socialize and make friends. Roblox is the greatest game of all time. But there are 2 things you'll want you're child to stay away from. 1st: Free robux websites. Websites like these promise your child free in-game currency called ""robux"". These websites often scam your children, and leads to their account getting hacked. Stay away friom these websites, and your children's account's will be safe. 2nd: Online daters. There are people in roblox who tend to ""date"" on certain games. Sometimes It leads to sexual experience, and might even be an creepy 40 year old predator. Make sure to stay away from these people. (Tip: When you are playing an roleplay game and somebody says ""hi"" but they're another gender, it could mean that they're trying to date you. ) Remember: This is a great platform for everyone!","Adult"
"age 2+","It is a good game, it has guns, violence, disgusting things, and more!
All kids should play this GTA5 type game!!!","Adult"
"age 11+","I think Roblox is an amazing game BUT there are some concerning things too. Some games have violence such as murder or shooting but you can tell your child not to play those games. There is some swearing in the chat but Roblox has moderators and you can turn the chat off as well. You can buy a currency called Robux which gets you game passes or clothing for your avatar. I think Roblox is a great game IF your kid can handle it. One more thing you can friend people and also can get hacked if you play games labled FREE ROBUX.","Adult"

I can't even type numbers also if you have a young kid he is most probably playing adopt me and all those ""sex"" games they are just roleplay games and you can do nothing whenever their is a inappropriate game it get's erased within the next day plus I am only twelve I wrote this to teach you boomers and karens","Adult"

"age 5+","Many reviews are saying “don’t get this game people cuss” that is not true. Any curse words are filtered and if you type one it comes out as hashtags. I have been playing ROBLOX for years and the worst curse word I have seen on this game was the word “dummy”. If your account is under the age 12 then the amazing ROBLOX staff will block all numbers for you. If you still think it is bad, in settings you can disable the ability for your child to chat with others and view the chat. Sure there are some shooting games out there but they encourage strong teamwork and if you die all that happens is you fall apart like a lego figure. It is a great game that you should let your child play with some supervision. If your child likes building, then introduce them to “welcome to Bloxburg”. A game where you can build a house and get a job to make money. You can even create your own game! People say they have been getting big charges. You only get charged money if your child buys in-game money. If you have an Apple ID, you should not tell your child the password because if they know it they can access purchases.","Adult"

My son is more Interactive after he played for a few years, He does sometimes get stressed over hard games. So he sometimes asks me, or his friends for help! I am realley proud of him.
There is a bit too much of swearing tho.
Some people use inappropiate words to ¨Hurt you¨ And I dont appriciate that, So we make a list of people saying inappropiate stuff and report it and block them. BUT ROBLOX DOES NOTHING ABOUT IT. I'm dissapointed. But I am still happy that this game has changed my son for the better.","Adult"

"age 13+","So.. Roblox back when I created my account 'Turakius' in 2011 was absolutely amazing. I remember my nostalgia fun and memories which fill my mind as I think about it.
But unfortunately Roblox has seen better days.. they have such bad support. They take too long on replying too. Now its not just about the Support of Roblox.. its also the games. The Games back in 2011 were absolutely great, surviving fun games that people have created and it was just so much fun back then. Now days the Roblox games lack that sense of fun. Ever since they removed tix's it starting going down hill, each update for the website, Its like I watched my childhood go down the drain. Now.. the important part.. Hacking and Exploiting. The Game has users who are cheaters, hackers and people who love to exploit. A Couple of weeks ago my account was hacked, everything was gone. I could not get any access to my account whatsoever! Then When i tried to report it and get my account 'Turakius' Back, Then they said look for a receipt which was sent way back in 2018! Are they mad! This is silly and I have left the game for good, Well? Can you blame me? My account was hacked and stolen. I've tried everything I can to get access to it again but Roblox still do not believe I am the user to my account. But oh well.. Its been done.... So.. all i have to say is Well done Roblox for trashing such a good nostalgic game. Please fix your support system and not to forget a new updated and better security system. Thank you!","Adult"
"age 10+","I fully recommend this game to parents who are looking for a site for there children, if your child makes an account under the age of thirteen there is a setting to disable there ability to chat. There are many different games too choose from, for any girl I would recommend Royale High, it is a royal role playing dress up game, you earn diamonds (Which is there in-game currency) to buy items like wings and skirts by attending classes and leveling up. For any boy I would recommend Jailbreak or Arsenal. Children can also buy Robux with parent consent to change there avatar. Be aware of bullies, trolls, and admin abusers. Block and report them to keep others safe. DO NOT share any personal information, and always be smart while playing. This game also lets your child code games, they also have a YouTube channel where you can find great tutorials on how to code a basic game.","Adult"

"age 10+","Soooo, I totally dislike roblox. As the kids have gotten older, and want to stay in contact with friends we’ve set guidelines and talked about what games are allowed and what games are not allowed. There are some cute “clean” games on roblox, but the junk is abundant. We have a pretty strict policy that if they do not honor the boundaries we put in place then we can just not use roblox. They only played it on the Xbox in the living room ...
.
That being said - this year - someone got it on the laptop to play with a friend and - it was out of control! The chat rooms were unbelievably vulgar even for adults.
.
We then learned that playing on an Xbox is different than playing on tablets and computers. On Xbox the chat can be limited to friends (that we know) and there is not a group chat happening. .... terribly sad.

my child age 10 herd of this and downloaded it, soon after she ask for this ro dollars so I bought it. she bought a riding potion for her pet in this game called adopt me.

one thing to note that you cant say F S A N C word and also not numbers if your account is less than 13 years old but you can say bada** that is the only thing you cant say most country like UK US CANADA ect

There were the time to time bullies in the game but it didn't effect him. He loved participating in the in-game events to win cool prizes. The in-game currency know as ""Robux"" is very over-priced but it is optional. The site gives the players various opportunities to make their avatar look ""cool"" without spending money. My son got into designing things and 3d modeling because of this game. He sold shirts/pants on the avatar shop and was very successful. I joined this game just to see what it was like and I still play it from time to time today! Very good to play with friends. And a very good game in general. The only reason why i give it 4 stars is because it can become very addicting. And when signing make a complex password because there is a lot of hackers. But overall it is a very good game","Adult"

"age 12+","Roblox would be recommended by age 12 and up. If you have a kid and they don’t have their real birthday on change it so that it’s their real birthday. In Roblox people find ways to swear and say other words that’s why I recommend for the children to have it at their age. For those who say that Roblox is way to violent, roblox just has games that are like that, that are mean for older kids no for kids in the range if 5-10 but they are any older than that age they should be allowed to play it because they will know it’s a game with that purpose.

Or they can be used to gather someone's account info causing it to be scammed.","Adult"

"age 9+","I would definitely recommend this game. However, I would say there is some swearing, and accounts &lt; 13 cannot say numbers, which makes sense so they can't say phone numbers, addresses, etc. If you're worried about violent games, there is a safe mode you can turn on in the settings menu located in the top right-hand corner of the screen (it looks like a cog)","Adult"

"age 18+","I let me kids play this for months without thinking twice about it because it seemed so harmless. Take the opportunity to just sit and watch your kids play. The creepiness of the other players is disturbing. Even after blocking messaging and having other parental controls, other users are constantly entering their games and just standing there. Some of the games gave my son anxiety and he was unable to sleep for weeks. I couldn't figure out why until after watching these games! Remember ANYONE is allowed to create these games! They can be violent, weird, creepy, and overall so not appropriate for younger kids. Users can message your kids, your kids end up with tons of friends like they would social media and you have no idea who they are. Just a caution!","Adult"
"age 15+","Roblox is a popular game. i'm an adult but I play too. Roblox is not the bad thing, the bad thing is the community that plays the game. Even thought 50% of roblox users are kids under 13, but there are still adult.
If your an adult and you are reading this, here are something you can do to prevent your kids from seeing inappropriate things(hashtags, sexual activities, etc.)
Open the parent page from roblox, go to account setting, and then you can set what kind of games and what content your kid is seeing. That's it, easy.
But if your a kid and your seeeing this, first, when you write a comment in this, don't use slangs, like ""U"", ""idk"", ""ngl"", etc. These make you sound a complete idiot. Also, don't argue with adults, they haev a right point of view, and so do you. Roblox is a good game. But you have to be careful, or you see things like: ""abc for a gf/bf"", ""####(hashtags)"", ""lol you are dumb"", you have to report these people. Also you SHOULD NOT trust anybody on roblox expect if you know them irl(In Real Life). They are possibly bots, scammer, information stealer, or possibly some people who wanna kill/kidnapp you. I'm not just scaring you. So take my advice and play roblox safely.
Overall, roblox is a good game, everyone should play it. BUT there is bad people on roblox and you have to be careful around them.
Thanks for taking time and reading this.","Adult"
"age 5+","Roblox is a wonderful game for many kids!!! It’s not a very much learning game, but if your on a road trip and your kids need something to do, I highly recommend this app. The ads for buying in app purchases aren’t bad at all, and it doesn’t ask for any personal info. You can play with your in real life friends if they have an account. Your child can be as creative as they want to be. They can design houses, open a restaurant, talk to other players (optional), play with animals, customize their character, etc. I highly recommend!","Adult"

"age 3+","ROBLOX doesn't just have fighting games. There are games like adopt me which have zero violence. The kill effect is just the character's body parts falling apart, like a collapsed Lego building. There is also a feature called account restrictions which, if turned on, makes it so that the account can only access curated content on the platform, and the contact settings will be set to off.","Adult"

"age 2+","I DEFINITELY know what you're thinking. AGES 2 AND UP?! WHAAAAAAT?!?!?! Roblox is a great site, and I'll tell you why. At the start of Roblox, you sign up. Creating a username might be difficult because Roblox doesn't allow you to have the same name as everyone else (the website has over 1,000,000,000 users created) but the password is easy. You just have to make it (at the least) 8 letters/numbers long. Then you're signed in! You're avatar (by default) is a ""Bacon Hair"" and you have a few choices to change your avatar. But then, here is what parents don't like. The in game currency, Robux. It is pretty cheap though. There are multiple clothes that you can wear for 5 robux ($1.00 USD = 80 robux) that are pretty cool. Users can also create items using pictures they've saved from the web. If they sell them, the user can ALSO get robux from that too. Now to talk about the games. If you are a (somewhat) strict parent and do not want your child seeing the occasional word ""hell"" in chat, go to your child's settings and limit chat to ""friends only or no one"". There are almost 10,000,000 games for your child to discover and play. The chat feature is good for chatting with friends and other people in game. Games allow you to be a police officer and catch criminals in a big city, role-playing like your character is going to high school, story games which can help your child with defending themselves, obby games where your character avoids obstacles and is given a prize at the end, survival games which help your child learn how to protect themselves from a natural disaster, and MANY MANY more. Although there is some role-playing into ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" those users use the chat to talk so again, just turn off chat if you want to avoid that. If your child says, ""I see a bully,"" in game there are two options. Reporting people which will give that bullying user a warning that their account will be banned if they do it again, or by blocking someone by going to their account, tapping the options button on the side and tap on ""block user"". Finally, if you don't want your child PLAYING Roblox, you can always allow them to watch others (youtubers) play Roblox games. With that, there is nothing more to say so please allow your child to play Roblox today!","Adult"
"age 2+","Roblox is a super fun game and should not be hated this game is so fun when I have kids and they're 5 years old I will buy them a table and let them play Roblox!","Adult"
"age 8+","ROBLOX is a family friendly game and is a nice game, One day my son asked me to buy him robux then I bought him 25000 robux. Then I went to his room and he was playing this game called Blox Paradise. A girl asked him to come to her house and go n@ked bed. I got really angry and banned him from the rp games. I think you should ask you're kids to not visit RP games. And someone thought him the word wtf but if he says wtf clearly it gets tags and I really mind a little about the security system in roblox","Adult"
"age 6+","Roblox is a fine game for kids over five. Other parents say that this game is for 13, 14 or even 18+ this game is fine for most kids occasionally on games like murder mystery which I have tried personally people can sometimes be a little toxic to beginners but and play songs that are very inappropriate but that only happens in that specific game I would suggest not playing but literally no other game has any inappropriate content like music that they can freely choose what songs to play. So overall I think it a great game for your kids and you should all over your kids around 6+ to play this game","Adult"

"age 9+","Fraudulent charges appeared on my account due to us putting in payment information a long time ago. It is completely unclear how to disassociate and delete billing information. Roblox thinks they CANNOT ANSWER THE PHONE due to Covid, so they are directing us to a ""support"" page. After submitting all the information about the request, we have to verify we are human by playing a game where we turn 9 animal images right side up, but apparently if you get the images at the slightest wrong angle they make you start the ""game"" over, simply to submit a communication to the support page! This is beyond ridiculous. They are clearly taking advantage of a young audience and putting parents in a poor position.","Adult"

"age 7+","Roblox is a fun game platform with unlimited game options. Many parents complain that there are many exploiters or trollers who swear and cyber bully, and I just want to remind everyone that cyberbullying happens throughout every gaming platform. Not to mention, there's safe chat installed in roblox, so there's an unlikely event of meeting a bully. If your kids do come across a bully or exploiter, you can simply disable their chat or set their chat so that they can only talk to their trusted friends. You can also resort to blocking and reporting players, which is extremely helpful. Another complaint I see a lot in the reviews is that there are a lot of online daters in Roblox. If you catch your kids doing inappropriate things online such as dating, that means you're being an irresponsible parent and not keeping track of the games your child is playing. Make sure they're playing a safe and child friendly game, because Roblox is a platform targeted for every age group. There are more complaints on a game called Jailbreak, which is often compared to GTA 5 in the reviews. Firstly, I've played Jailbreak before, and I can say that it isn't as violent as described. Secondly, if you think Jailbreak isn't child friendly, stop blaming Roblox and let them play other games instead, Karens. Overall, Roblox is a great platform, and I recommend it to all kids.","Adult"

I was shocked he was playing adult games like ""piggy"" where a pig would chase him and kill his character. I saw a game called survivor the spongebob the killer. what is this?!?!

I play roblox for almost 4 and all you did is nothing but let people do this disgusting shit .

"age 9+","This platform is good for kids. Just with a little downsides. First you can interact with players. Next your child can code games on roblox studio. Puls theres many games to play. Lastly it has parental setting. Next here’s some downsides. First players can do strange thing. For example If your kid play Work At A Pizza Place then players can ask you to quit as manager to get the job then report you for “Bullying”, Or if you play Adopt Me then people roleplay as boy friends and girlfriends report them. Next the chat filter makes it hard to speak if you set your age under 13. Lastly if your kid is playing a roblox shooter game make sure it ok, Ones like phantom forces can get bloody, But there is fun and safe ones (Arsenal,Bad Business) that have no blood. Just make sure that kids have parental stuff and that you play with them also get a big SSD (250 GB-2 TB) if you want to use studio.

"age 18+","Roblox is a sexual game about sex, it's crude, a lack of quality, no corny theme song, and David Funpack- I mean David Basuzki made a horrible game.
1. Too little Mortimer Mouse hangouts, I mean LOVE Mortimer Mouse so for them to have too little is extremely sad.
2. Sexual lego's, my daughter saw a hot little lego and she said :''hi'' and he said :''hi'' then she said: ''you good'' he said: ''yeah''
and that could be a pervert or a 82 y.o man.
3. it censors out too many things, I find it stupid how I actually need too say something like t h I s cause it's stupid.

"age 9+","Twice this has happened to my daughter, and these are the only two times we have tried to purchase Robux. Both time I gave my daughter money to purchase items in the game and neither time was her account credited. The first time was in the amount of $2.46 and the second time was through a gift card for $25. Now the people ar Roblox are trying to claim that not only was it credited to her account but it was spent. We never spent it because it never showed up. I tried to file a complaint with the BBB but they dont deal with complaints that way. By the way for anyone who hasn't seen the list of complaints through the BBB about this company should check it out. This company is such a scam.","Adult"

"age 15+","We have had Roblox for the summer of 2020 since May. We and our friends have had mostly trouble.
My child is educated on internet safety and she has reported many things to me as she and her friends come across it. I’ve also witnessed various con’s and pro’s.
One of the main issues is with the company and it's handling of those who violate their guidelines/rules. There are many groups that openly bully and admit it yet still are in the games and play often. There are hackers and scammers too that can stay and are only banned from certain games.
The game does an ok job of concealing bad language with hashtags over the offensive words however there are ways to get around this.
You must do a few housekeeping tasks to ensure you are safe from not only certain players but the company itself.
Make sure your children have some education on internet safety.
Make sure you READ all the policies there are many and several circle around to the companies benefit with no recourse but appeal which is usually denied. They stick to the policies with no exceptions. This is good but the individual situations are not reviewed beyond the complaint and the company text.
I've witnessed several bullying situations with my child, her friends and others in the game. There have been comments and actions that are not appropriate for kids at all.
Keep an eye on which games you enter as well. There are some instances of being taken to a private room for in appropriate behavior.
Supervise your children at first and guide them to the safer games (servers). Many are private and are governed by those who create them.
There are Robux which kids need to get certain things and are often encouraged to buy. You pay a certain amount of money to receive Robux. Kids can earn game money when they do certain tasks or when a pretend check pops up and they click on it. This will only “buy” certain things. For the bigger or more prized items like potions and certain clothes, pets, transportation etc. You must use a credit card to purchase Robux.
My general advice is that the games are more suited toward teens and older. If you have a younger child on be sure to supervise them and watch what they are doing. Be sure they are learning the right things.","Adult"

At the end of the day it depends what you feel fit for your children...First of all I recommend you make your child give their real age becase there is a chat filter that lets innappropiate words get blocked out.Secondly, it helps them play games that are for THEIR AGE! Your children can also friend people and they can chat with them etc.etc A good thing I know roblox does is that they don't let kids delete their messages,which really helps me keep track of what my child sends to other players. Another thing I made my kids do is friend people they only know in real life. I feel its very important that parents know what their kids play online that is why I am typing this review for all those people who have kids! I reccomend you change your child's accounts' privacy settings so you can disable the chat options...but do know that people around them can still chat..","Adult"
"age 7+","My 6 year old son loves the game","Adult"
"age 6+","My child loves the game a lot and I also think it is amazing. There are a few problems with stuff like chat and friends but that can all be blocked with restrictions. There are some trolls out there and the game can be quite addicting and result in temper problems. Otherwise, love it.","Adult"

"age 7+","its great this is literally my childhood I'm sorry for parents that think because people are mean in the chat the game is bad well there is an alternative like TURNING OFF CHAT IN SETTINGS also just avoid sketchy role play games if you don't want inappropriate content and as for blood i don't recommend horror games. And violence is in every video game so forget no violence. Also in the description of the game it shows what to expect.","Adult"

"age 17+","Fortnite is an evil, cruelel, bloody mess. My grandson has been playing this game for a year now and he has turned from a sweetheart to a MONSTER. This game is an outragous scam that is easy to get addicted to. My grandon has been asking for this V MONEY for his 10th birthday and I am now 2000 moneys in debt. He has not shut up about killing girls in this game and how he is always winning, this game rewards communism as well as shooting people in the head with better guns and corruptness. I am glad to have come across the sight so I can send a messege to fellow parents... FORTNITE WILL CORRUPT YOUR CHILD. The creators of this monstrosity should feel terrible about this creation and delete this scum from society. I HAVE LOST MY GRANDSON TO THIS MISTAKE DO NOT LET IT HAPPEN TO YOURS.","Adult"

1. You can talk with people
2. You can customize your avatar
3. You can make your own game
Basically, everything!! ROBLOX IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE &gt;:(","Adult"

"age 8+","IF your 8 y.o. is mature then, WITH SUPERVISION AND EXTREMELY CLEAR RULES, GUIDELINES &amp; BOUNDARIES, as well as making the consequences for not abiding by them crystal clear, then I feel like there are a lot of good things about the game! I have to admit, prior to the pandemic, I had never, personally, spent time researching the games in Roblox, but instead allowed the ""naysayers"" to influence my decision not to allow my 8 y.o. dtr to play. In fact, as a general rule, I avoided ""screens"" like the plague and had never so much as talked to my daughter about online ""etiquette"", let alone ""online safety"", i.e., how to spot ""grooming"" behavior, which, as you probably already know, is a term used to refer to predators who say &amp; do certain things to gain the trust of our kiddos! However, that all changed when the pandemic caused our world as we knew it came to a screeching halt this past March, i.e., no more attending traditional brick &amp; mortar school, playing with friends, going on vacation, to summer camps, etc., etc..!! I started doing a lot of research about gaming so ""I"" could learn ""internet safety"", i.e., what ""grooming"" looked like, how to report it, etc., etc.. After hours of research, I had educated myself by not only reading &amp; learning from experts, but also by creating a Roblox account for myself so I could actually play the games the kids my dtr's age were playing. EDUCATING my child about INTERNET SAFETY &amp; ETIQUETTE, PLAYING THE GAME MYSELF, as well as implementing the following the RULES (see below), allowed me to feel felt confident that my daughter could now safely play on the ""virtual playground"".
Talking &amp; video chatting with friends on ""Messenger Kids"" while playing Roblox (Adopt Me) is NOT a substitute for ""in person"" play, but it's a ""port in the storm"" and within moderation, has prevented my daughter from being too terribly affected by the pandemic! I was always the one who said ""technology, screens, etc., is a curse for our youth""; However, after opening myself up to the idea &amp; taking the time to educate myself, etc., I can now say ""technology is a blessing"" when used in MODERATION &amp; with RULES! However, without moderation &amp; crystal clear rules, that same technology went from a ""curse to a blessing"" will quickly return to a curse.
RULES IN OUR HOUSE
1) No friending anyone you don't know in real life.
2) No chatting in the game with anyone ! Messenger Kids is a safe, excellent alternative!
3). Ask if you want to play a new game within Roblox. This allows me to research that particular game as well as play it myself BEFORE the kiddos do.
4) No ""scamming"" (a big thing in the ""Adopt Me"" game).
5) Real life chores MUST be done to earn money Robux.
In summary, once you have done all of your homework, I love how these games foster creativity, teaches coding, as well as how to save &amp; manage money. My FAVORITE game for this is probably Bloxburg","Adult"
"age 7+","So yes people swear and say certain inappropriate things, but if u turn off chat it is very difficult to find inappropriate things. The only way if ur chat is disabled is by joining an inappropriate game your “friend” is playing. Bc it is very hard to find inappropriate games. I still play the game and have been since early 2016, and have never found a inappropriate game. There also are killing games, however u can just check ur kids recently played if u dint want them playing these. Also if u have the desktop version u can make games. U can buy “premiuM” the in game currency (used to be called robux and there are hackers. If u are smart u can pretty easily find someones ip adress and find theme. But its hard if there not on ur friends list.","Adult"
"age 8+","Roblox can be inappropriate for specific ages but if you monitor your kids it will be fine. when they turn 10, you may let them play whateer they'd like.","Adult"
"age 18+","I play this game with my kids. The games they like to play aren't educational at all and anyone can make a game and monetize it. Many times my kids will be playing a game that has pop-ups for purchases with Robux and my kids have made accidental purchases that are impossible to be refunded. Once I was playing the game ""Adopt Me"", which is very popular, and one ""kid"" was trying to lure others to their house to ""do it"". I reported it and sent a separate report, but I don't know if the person was investigated at all. In the same game, players are constantly scamming eachother out of pets and other items that are purchased with Robux. In another game, a player was bullying me after being in the game for just a few minutes. I reported that player, too, but the players are often cruel to eachother in chat and I'm sure most parents don't even know they can turn that feature off for their kids. Players can also friend eachother without any approval from parents and then message eachother in game. This is unacceptable. There is no way to protect our kids properly in this game and it needs a huge overhaul to be safe. Many games are violent and include players killing eachother with various weapons or monsters chasing them to kill them.","Adult"
"age 7+","This game is best for kids. It has a wide selection of games to choose from and can keep in touch with old friends and family members. This game might change in behaviors and grades but if Your kid does anything else on the internet you should look into that aswell. Albert/flamingo is a youtuber I do not think he wants kids killing their animals and ""sacrificing them to satin."" He is doing this as entertainment and a joke. Not saying it is funny but, just clarifying that it is a simple joke. Also when somebody in roblox knows your kids real name that usually means they somewhat told them their relevant name. Roblox does not promote online dating and other S3x related stuff. When someone is cursing in the chat just close it or leave the game. That only takes 3 seconds to do. No sweat. I think Roblox is an AWESOME platform and has a great system.","Adult"
"age 11+","I didn't realize how addicting this game is to my 11 year old daughter. Before the pandemic she only played it once or twice on her friend's computer. Since the lockdown she really got into it as that's all her friends talked about. She is a good student at school and has quite a bit after school activities. However playing Roblox has really changed her behavior. She got super addicted to it like all of her friends. She couldn't focus on her class or anything else she had to do anymore. When we take away her computer she would sneak around at night to play it. When we changed her account password she would play on her friends account. We don't dismiss the educational value aspect of the games but this app seems to take over young kids mind. My child became so argumentative and sassy when we took away her access to her Roblox account. Also some of the activities on Roblox are completely time suckers. It doesn't do anything but keep the kids mind hypnotized. I highly recommend parents keep a watchful eye on the duration of time your kids spend on playing the games and the type of games they play with friends and their communications with each other. From our experience and what we heard from many friends about their children spending more than one or two hours a day on Roblox doesn't do good but damage to the children. We ended up banning our daughter from accessing the site for two weeks. She finally bounced back to the delightful child she was before.","Adult"
"age 16+","My son was a victim of a hack. My PayPal account was hacked and the source was Roblox.
Kids are able to buy items (ie. clothes, halo’s, wings, accessories etc) to change their avatar appearance). The kids long to have the latest looks, some items are ‘limited’ editions and the rarer it is the higher it’s trading value becomes. The kids become addicted to this. It’s akin to hitting the reward centre of the brain in gambling.
I received PayPal notifications of four lots of £92.99 debited in three minutes. I managed to get my password change and stopped it luckily. My son, meanwhile, had his Roblox password changed, and session disconnected so he couldn’t change it himself. He had to raise a support request for Roblox to change his password to allow him to re-gain access to his Roblox account.
Because we notified them to the account being compromised, Roblox them shut down my son’s account. Their response is that, because of the compromise they will not reopen or discuss the account any further. They refer to their terms and conditions. This also states a mediation route is possible, but they are not providing information of this either.
As well as being a victim of the initial financial crime, my son now has no access to any existing Roblox funds he may still have In his account. His Roblox service is terminated with no further redress to whether Roblox should do this or not.
I’m writing this so that parents are aware of this risk. If you buy your child Robux, your purchasing account is at risk. If the child’s Roblox account is hacked, any money that you have spent in the account will also be lost. My son is devastated as he has traded up and up, and some items he says are very rare.
This response from Roblox is victim blaming. My son became very emotional having just been denied everything he has built up. He is young, and had I been aware I would have not allowed this risk.
Please also read the Apple App Store reviews, as many mention hacking risks. I would be interested to know how many more children know about this. They may not have told their adult purchasers. Please post if you can enlighten others. Any help would be appreciated.","Parent"
"age 2+","WHY WOULD THIS GAME MAKE TAGS HALF OF EVERYTHING YOU SAY GOES TO TAGS (unless you have safe chat) why is safe chat even a thing half of it is people (OD) online daters taking children’s info with apps such as (snap chat, discord, or iMessage get your child a android this game SUCKS I RAGE SO MUCH and people are so very mean (cyber bullying) I’ve cried many times bc I’m a cry baby :)","Adult"
"age 10+","This game is appropriate for 10+. Not very violent but sometimes there may be toxic language in the chat but it is censored with a hashtag.","Adult"
"age 7+","Roblox is super fun for kids ages 7 plus. Here is the thing with all these reviews complaining about roblox. As with anything, you must be responsible and talk to your kids about what is okay and what is not. If they can follow your rules Roblox will be a great fun experience. If your just letting your kids do whatever they want on roblox without talking to them about it then yes they can find some questionable things. Parents know what your kids do online and kids follow the rules. Very simple. Roblox is very fun!","Adult"

"age 10+","I think ROBLOX is i fun game. I don't recommend games like island life or meep city if your under 13. Don't give away any information to people. Also if your buying rubox, use paypal or roblox gift codes. Not visa cause i Used visa once and the next day someone in another state got my information and spent my money. Pretty good game i think.","Adult"
"age 4+","I started when I was around 4/2 and I loved it!I have been playing for very long but now im 10 I have started playing other games to including Fortnite,And Call of duty.You dont have to spend money but you can if you choose.I like to play Jailbreak,Skyblox,And most tycoons and sims.There is a chat feature that will block numbers and other thing that could give away personal info.When you sign up you can put your birthday and if your over 13 it gives you some more freedom in the chat.Also for parents you can go to settings and turn off chat you can also make a 2Fa code and make a pin so only the people that know the pin can change settings.There is some times a swear word that passes through but no often you can block players so you cant join them and they cant join you.I think roblox is good and those parents that say it horrible haven't even checked to see if they can turn on a safety setting so its there fault. I recommend 4 and up you can play if your younger but I think you should have somebody over 16.","Adult"
"age 7+","My 9 and 12 year old daughters love this game. They started playing last year but since quarantine began in March they have been playing a little every day. We have never paid any $ and they have the chat feature turned off so they don't talk to others playing that they don't know in real life. They do have friends from real life that they are ""friends"" with on Roblox. They are able to talk to them on a secure chat box while they are all playing the games from their own homes. This has been a wonderful way for them to socialize while school/activities have been shut down. They even have a few friends in other states that have moved away that they play with. It's a great way to keep in touch. Some of their favorite games are Royal High, Shred, Expedition to Antarctica, Mad City, Work at a Pizza Place, and Troll Obby. Overall, Roblox seems like a great game. As long as public chat is turned off, kids are told that no money will be spent, and parents monitor which games kids choose to play (letting them know if they're not allowed on any with guns, etc.) then Roblox is a fun, educational, and wonderful way for kids to learn.","Adult"
"age 5+","Great game. If you want to disable chat just go. to settings.","Adult"
"age 9+","My daughter played this game when she was 10 until she was 12 then decides she was to old for it. At first I thought the idea was scary but my daughter begged. So I did some research and found parents complaining about online dating and sex rooms. I also found people saying that there was a safe way to play it so me and my daughter gave it a trial. We set up her account together and it was an under 13 account so to my surprise it actually blocked the games that were for over 13s. I also set up the parental controls and put in the pin also blocked that chats so she could only play with friends I also linked my account. After that she started to dress up her character And started to play royals high which a game were you pretend to be a princess and meepcity were you take care of an animal called a meep (she also played mad city a super hero game fashion frenzy a fashion game etc) she would also code and I was honestly impressed with roblox she would play with her friends and I would play with her occasionally. Now she’s played it for 2 years and she doesn’t play anymore but as a parent I was concerned at first but after you added parental controls it’s all fun and games! The parental controls are STRONG trust me

There is games like plugwalks or scented con which have sexual content but the games get deleted very fast. If your son sees naked lego characters tell him to leave the game and report it. Also you can put account restrictons for them to not play scented con also you can turn off chat in settings! There are no swearing because it can tag it and also roblox is a moneymaking maschine but the prices are good!","Adult"
"age 9+","I read this site before I let my kids play it. I thought by playing age appropriate games and blocking chat would protect them. Nope. Today my 7 year old brought me the iPad with a Guess the Drawing game on (it has a yellow pencil icon with Draw it in the game choices and it’s audience listed is everyone). It started with a smile drawing then to a giraffe then to a eyebrow then a suspicious drawing to me but not my daughter started to appear. I’m really sick thinking about all the other innocent kids in there without their parents not seeing what I saw to intervene. My daughter had no idea that it was a half drawn penis when I took over the iPad completely. I’m not sure if young kids read these reviews so I don’t want to say too much but let’s just say it was X rated. I am not aware of other drawing games if you do please comment. I know you can put up signs in your house (that you can type a message on)or whatever structure that’s yours. I educated her &amp; my 9 yo on not going into others houses because they are stranger just like you wouldn’t do that in real life (unbelievable that I have to say this on a children’s game)but if you know the person then it’s ok. Not to say they wouldn’t write something bad on their wall too but there is less of a chance of this happening with my children’s 7 yo &amp; 9 yo friends. I need to see if the signs hashtag out bad words. I’ll try this out tonight when my daughter is asleep &amp; see what happens. I’ll just need to make sure I know how to take the sign Down after I do it. It may not know how to hashtags out descriptions of bad things without using bad words. Probably the only way to truly control this is to only let them play when you are watching. I have told them when they start a new game I need to see them play it first. If older kids are given an opportunity to draw or chat in a sneaky way to get around the blocking software or whatever they will do it and now I’ve seen it happen first hand. I have the pictures to prove it and the name of the player. Immediately after all those disgusting drawings someone else had their turn and drew a sweet little teddy bear. Probably another innocent 7 yo like my little girl. Makes me sick. Don’t worry...I reported this person to the game and looked him up and reported him. They will only eject him from Roblox if there are multiple reports. I pray there are.","Parent of a 7 and 9-year-old"

"age 6+","Roblox is a fun multiplayer game. There are educational games and games that can introduce people to certain Job titles. Roblox is also a great place to play with friends and family. People complain about the shooting games and horror games on the platform but, Roblox has a setting that can stop your child from playing games like that. Also, if you don't want people communicating with your child then you can remove the option to chat in game. Just make sure to monitor what games your kid plays because there are some games that can cause your Roblox account to be deleted. For example, some games claim to give the player free pets in a game called ""Adopt Me!"" and some games say that they can give you free robux. However, you can prevent your child from playing these games by telling them to watch out for games that claim to give you free items.

Solutions to problems parents might have.
1. If someone is sending you bad things, disable chat in settings or block the user.
2. If you run into someone trying to online date, block them or avoid them.
3. If you are running into someone saying free robux, Don't fall for it. Educate your children about scams online.
4. If someone is breaking the Roblox TOS(Terms of Service) do not attack roblox or private message them on facebook or something, avoid the person or report them.

"age 18+","An absolutely horrible game, after only 3 weeks of playing this game my child was having extreme Tantrums that resulted in her having to be taken do the mental health ward. I explained to them she's been playing Roblox and not only did the nurse but the unit social worker we're aware of Roblox and said this is the worst game they have ever seen for children. I have removed this game for my child it has been 4 weeks and for about three of those weeks I have had zero issues. I have never had an issue with my child until she played Roblox. Any parents that say this is a good game for children are completely naive and I suggest you guys Google and read other reviews .this game is extremely sexually explicit and not only is it sexual it is a open chat room. I had all the parental control settings set among allowing my child to register and that did not even help her safety whatsoever. She had been propositioned by men in the chat rooms and brought into game rooms where large orgies were taking place. I absolutely HATE this game and I wish I could actually put the harm it does to children on the creator.
DO NOT ALLOW YOUR CHILDREN TO PLAY ROBLOX EVER!!
and to top it off, I asked the admin of the game to remove her account and explained the reasons why &amp; he was stating his concern for her loss of achievements if I were to remove her profile.
So you can't even delete their profile you have to ask permission , which ultimately shows their level of concern","Adult"

Roblox is NOT a game, but a game engine. Players make their own games and make lots of friends. More proper details is that talented designers and coders can go to make a very realistic a high-end game like 'Phantom Forces' or 'Blackhawk rescue mission 5'. But for kids or low-end devices, they are welcome too! An old Doomspire Brickbattle or the very funny 'Fart attack'. Everything as possible on Roblox.","Adult"

"age 12+","Roblox allows fraudulent content to scam children of their money and then denies all responsibility. My daughter spent 250 Robluxs on content within the site promising her a rare pet Shadow Dragon for use within the Adopt Me game. She never received it and was very upset. I reported the content and emailed Roblox asking for a refund. They told me to contact a game developer. I sent the developer of Adopt me games a screenshot of her purchase and the game developer told me the content my daughter bought from a fraudulent developer and to report it to Roblox and ask them for a refund. I opened a second ticket with screen shoots of developer of Adopt me games response and of the item/seller in which Roblux customer support did nothing. A third ticket was opened when the store and the seller was deleted and Roblox told us to ""contact the developer"" and hid behind their terms of service.

"age 8+","Wonderful game, very safe. Make sure the account's birthday is under 13. You can check if your account by looking in the top right corner, where it will or will not say 13+. However, there are some games to avoid. There are roleplay games like Frappe, Bakiez, Soro's, Blend, ect. These are games where users go to interviews, and train. But these are filled with trollers. These are most likely to have people bypassing the chat filter. Another game to avoid is Bloxburg. It is a very fun game, but this will end up with lots of money spent, or in game currency called ""Robux"". A player can build their house, with Bloxburg currency, This can be made by working, or buying with Robux. It is tiring to get in game currency, and I about a year ago spent 100+ real dollars on it. It is much easier to buy money, and the in game money is very expensive. Some positive games to try are Royal High, which you can be a prince/princess. There are also games called obbies, which is where the user jumps over obstacles. There are guns in certain games, but 0 blood. The player's avatar will have their blocks apart, and will respawn in 10 seconds if they 'die'. Another positive game is Adopt me, where people roleplay. I personally am not a fan, but it is aimed to younger players. Games to avoid are ones that say free robux. There is many how to's on youtube kids, and overall it is a very positive game with a positive enviroment. If the user swears in chat it will appear in hashtags, and it has a very strict filter. Users who are 13+ can say some more words, but usually just 'damn' and numbers. Overall, I love this game, and I feel it is perfect for all ages. I hope my review is not biased,","Adult"

We put in her username/password and it claims ""username/password invalid"" after the first time we just assumed okay maybe it was just a hacker let's create a new username and more difficult password. The second time we put money on her account as she asked for for her birthday for the same exact thing to happen not even 12 hours after money was put into her account when we clicked forgot password they never send an email with any information about password reset like they should. Before anyone says anything yes we did validate an email on the account while it was active and yes we made sure the password was not given to anyone. We are furious and have reached out to the company multiple times with no response. Please parents don't waste your money on this, it's not worth it.","Adult"

"age 17+","Roblox is a dangerous platform for ANYONE especially kids. Players are able to create games and platforms that anyone can join. These creators are web developers, hackers and highly experienced with computers and IT. There are games created specifically to hack into any device you are using. They can steal sensitive information and gain access to everything stored on your phone and computer. They are able to access to cameras/microphones and monitor what’s going on in your home. It’s extremely scary. (They record and save videos of your children playing)! These people DO hack children. My child’s device was compromised. They are moderators of the game and sadly some of your kids’ favorite you tubers are associated with them. They are the creators of some of the most popular games on Roblox. I do NOT recommend this app to ANYONE at any age. Roblox needs to do a better job at monitoring what’s being created and by who.
A common theme hackers love is anime. If you see a YouTuber, “creator”, minigame, etc., focusing around anime it’s best to stay away.
Lastly, there are a ton of in appropriate mini games in Roblox. With vile imagery not suitable for children. You never know if you’re clicking into a game that’s innocent or designed to exploit.","Adult"
"age 2+","Let any child play this game","Adult"
"age 18+","The games that kids play on this platform are fraught with scams and cheats and Roblox continues to take no responsibility for their action sayin, ""reach out to the developer"". When Roblox takes the parents money for Robux and kids (my daughter is 9) who use them gets scammed, that is Roblox's responsibility to make sure children are not taken advantage of. They hide behind their ""terms of use"" which states that we agree not to take them to court when we purchase the Robux. Let it be known that Roblox allows this kind of behavior and will not remedy anything.","Adult"
"age 8+","My son spent ages building up an account that he played with his friends with during lockdown. We had some extra payments that we did not recognise, over and above the £40 we had spent. When I queried the payments they just deleted the account with no conversation.
There is no number to call. Do not use this system.","Adult"
"age 6+","When my son tries to log in when his computer shut down but before that this never happed.","Adult"
"age 14+","For those who think Roblox is okay for their kids, maybe you should SIT AND WATCH the game and how they text each other. Saying things like ""Lets have roblox $3x"" and "" Ok Daddy"". IDK about you all, but I don't think that's cute nor appropriate to let a CHILD play. + WATCH (AND) PLAY YOUR KIDS GAMES BEFORE judging it, thinking it's ""just a game"".","Adult"
"age 8+","So roblox is like a platform where a lot of people build stuff, some can be inappropriate, some can be good. It depends on your age. There is a certain age to play certaing games. I geniunely think 8 and above should play this only. Not below that. Well thats at least what I recommend. Don't let your child to bad stuff. Thats all I'm gonna say about this topic.","Adult"
"age 11+","Quite disappointing. I have 3 kids, ages 11, 9 and 9. and they all play it. My daughter Maddie (11) likes ""Adopt Me"" ""Welcome to Bloxburg"" ""Frappe"" and ""Royal High"". My twin sons, Jack and Jacob (9) like ""Jailbreak"" ""Mad City""""Murder Mystery 2"" and ""Arsenal"", and they all like ""Piggy"" and ""Epic Mini Games."" However, my daughter was gonna record a Roblox TikTok when she found a game called, ""beat up simulator."" there is also a game called ""make a child and sell it"". However the worst incident thus far is a girl asking to have s*x with my NINE YEAR OLD SON, and my daughter playing""Bloxton Hotels"" when some creepy Roblox guy appeared in her shower. The game's currency, ""Robux"" is extremely overpriced as well. I would advise against letting your child playing Roblox, but if you do, take the following actions:
1: Don't buy Robux.
2: Turn your child's ability to chat off.
3: ALWAYS have the Roblox Safe Chat if you don't follow step 2.

"age 6+","ROBLOX is a free play move around game where people of all ages can play. It can test the inteligence of sombodys brain, and can expand the mind from knowledge. It is a fun and enjoyable game due to its popular in game games (Levels of confusing) and avatar costumization. Your child+ can build, imagine, inspire, build, and destroy. A few things you would want to be aware about. 1. The in-game currency ""Robux"" should be spend wisely, because to some robux prices could be a bit expensive for their taste, depending on how much you buy. 2. If your child starts to become more hostile or agressive after playing this game, the game should not be blamed. Your child may have been spending a few to hours long playing it. Getting in the way of being a functional human person, thus being an addiction. Might I recommend spending time outside? 3. The moderation is not used in the strongest way. However, the chat filter does block any nudification or swear words very well. 4. There is no possible way to get the in game currency for free. However, if the child/teen builds a well scripted fun game, they can get paid for the amount of popularity it gets. You could find bots or games saying ""Get free robux"" and asks for your login information for your account to ""Recieve your reward"" . Be cautious of this, as they are all scams. General overview : I would most definitely recommend for anybody to play. It is very fun and I thing can make your child have a fun experience, allthough there are some controversial games such as ""Murderer"" or ""Escape Jail"", I see nothing wrong with those. If your child is playing those games and resulting as a hostile human being. Its not the game's fault, it's their unhealthy addiction from playing it to much. (Again might I recommend spend some time outside). That is all for this game review. Have fun and stay safe!","Adult"
"age 7+","I was reading the reviews and saw a bunch of bad ones with stupid reasons like, this person wasn’t getting out of my car in game, BOI JUST LEAVE THE GAME IF THATS HAPPENING, it’s not really bad as long as you actually act like a parent and review your kids profile every once in a while, and if that’s not enough turn on restricted mode it’s that easy","Adult"
"age 8+","roblox isnt really bad but the poeple who play it are bad they think only cuz they have robux that they are kings and they trat the poeple without robux even worse than worms and more than half of the roblox players are hackers or bullies and some poeple are being annoying to poeple on purpose even if they know the other one doesnt like it","Adult"
"age 17+","So my son has been playing this and it there was not anything I was worried about until recently when some of the games were getting darker and another game on here that’s like a shooting game death match type but the players have on boom boxes on their back that bump some ghetto foul/explicit songs. This ain’t radio edited stuff, this is blaring loud and annoying. How does the music like this get on this game like that?? Anyway... He’s 7 and it’s getting deleted","Adult"
"age 6+","As a person who plays roblox (sometimes) I enjoy the game yes there might be some graphic content but people only target the game because all they see is the bad side (if there even is one) and judge the game based on what they saw. Those are the type of parents that don’t bother to investigate the website before they write this it’s almost like they would let there child play anything to later then say “this game is very violent and gory” which to be honest is a bunch of crap. It’s fun and me and my kids love it.","Adult"
"age 7+","Its a good game very nice censor system and no way for any type bad language to get through and you don't have to spend money on it but you could","Adult"
"age 8+","Absolutely a wonderful website for kids! my child had so much fun on it and is so responsible.","Adult"
"age 5+","Roblox is definintely appropriate for kids. Some people swear, but get real, everyone in school does this, so your kid probably knows about this anyway. The chat is sometimes innapropriate, but GET REAL, this is what it is like in the real world.","Adult"
"age 8+","It is a great game that takes creativity to another level. I don't recommend playing if you are sensitive to swearing, drinking/drugs, and online dating.","Adult"
"age 2+","It is the best game! My kid is enjoying it and learning! I buy him so much Robux and he gets so happy then he comes off and has fun outside! INSTALL NOW","Adult"
"age 2+","I think it's the best game in the world.It maybe broken sometimes but if you tell about hacking then you must have a very simple password.Enable two step verification from security,Settings.It sends a code to your email account and without the code you can't login.It has games like jailbreak, adopt me(the most played game in the world),piggy and murder mystery 2.DONT TELL LIES ABOUT IT AND MAKE IT GROW BIGGER.Also you can remove you credit card of premium subscription.","Adult"
"age 8+","Its a kid friendly game, with awesome opportunities to hangout with friends! You can choose from loads of games and even creat you own. I suggest this app to everyone above the age of 8. But be careful and don’t share personal info!","Adult"
"age 10+","So roblox in general is a good game, it's very creative and makes people interact with each other, in this game you can play different games, it's good for your kids to learn and explore, however you will need to check sometimes if they are playing some violent games, some games unfortunately do have guns, but without blood all that horrible stuff. That is about all that is bad about the game! There are many games that are learning games, even a catogory called learn and explore, my 11 year old really enjoys these types of games and I have looked into it and agreed that it was okay; even beneficial to the person playing.
So to recap this is a really good game for everyone to explore, however if you are a parent and you don't want your son or daughter playing violent things, then look on their account sometimes. Also sometimes the reviews are fake and/or they have not played many of the good games and have only clicked on the bad ones. Be careful about which review you trust.","Adult"
"age 2+","this game as a safe chat and the only thing you need to do is tell you child what and what not they can play. but do watch out because you kid can buy stuff with your credit card. in conclusion get this game if your kid can sit down and stop jumping on the walls or if they want to try it out","Adult"
"age 14+","It’s bad for young kids and will force them to buy things there is games I don’t let them play like arsenal which is highly inappropriate with guns and violence and on some games there are scammers that are way to young to play the game like 8 or 9 year olds","Adult"
"age 9+","Purchases sometimes glitch out and don't give you the product. Roblox will give lots of false excuses as to why this happens. But no offer for refund after many useless interactions with them. You'll pretty much give up and cut your losses. I've spent hundreds this past year with 4 kids who love this game. That has now dropped to 0.00. I'm done. Be careful when spending money. If anything only order small so they can't steal too much.","Adult"
"age 10+","We first let our son start playing Roblox around age 9 because his friends were playing it. Shortly after, I read up on the game and realized that the default was 13+ and if you wanted to limit certain game content, you needed to create a parent account and set it up for ""under 13"" and set a PIN code for access. After I did that, my son no longer wanted to play because ""all those games are stupid and for babies! I can't even get to any good games!""
He stopped playing, and all was well. Or so I thought... he suddenly started playing again, and I assumed he just found some games he liked. What actually happened was that he created a new 13+ profile without us knowing it! His favorite games are those where he can drive a car, and somehow he started getting into the law enforcement games which let him pretend to be an officer and do all the things real officers do including administration like payroll and deciding who gets to drive which car and such. He has always known that we don't allow any gun play, and we monitored his play closely to make sure there was none of that going on. The PC he plays on is in a common area so we can hear and see what is happening anytime. So, we allowed the 13+ profile to carry on as long as he kept the content non-violent.
Recently, our son (now age 11) said he got banned from his favorite game and that an admin did it ""for no reason."" He was SUPER angry and huffed about for days. Then he said he contacted the game moderator who he said apologized to him and told him the admin had acted inappropriately and that he was going to remove the ban. All was well for a while, but then he got banned again and again, said he had done nothing wrong. Eventually, he admitted that he had put on a uniform shirt that he didn't realize was such, and that the ban was for ""impersonating an officer."" He had also pepper sprayed another officer but told us he couldn't tell it was an officer because he was not in uniform and driving an unmarked car. I thought he was supposed to be an officer himself, and that everyone in the game were also officers.
My son got very angry and then started telling us all about how he wrote to the moderator and threatened that if they didn't reinstate him, he was going to ""get the whole game shut down."" We had a long chat with our son about appropriate reactions and consequences for making threats, and he seemed to understand that he should have asked what he could do to get reinstated rather than angrily snapping at the moderator. He just kept going on about it, saying ""they let me play the game for a little while, so I think I'm not banned, but then they ban me again!"" Finally, I suggested that since there seemed to be so little control over getting banned, the game wasn't worth his trouble and he needed to find a different game. He seemed to understand, but today my husband caught him writing a Word document to the moderator about the ban again. We are now blocking Roblox on all his devices for a while until he can prove he can play the games appropriately and respect other players and any time and content limits we create.
This is too bad, because in Roblox Studio, our son was creating movie scenes and rock concert stage set-ups and generally being creative. But a lot of the games are modeled after GTA where you can hurt others and engage in inappropriate conduct. Our son loves cars and driving them, but it's hard to keep him interested for very long in other driving games like Paradise City and Forza, and he has no interest in more age-appropriate games like Mario Brothers. He loved Minecraft for many years but also got bored with that as well as Zelda after having his Switch for only about a year.
I think Roblox on the whole is probably okay for older kids with more self-control but definitely requires close parental supervision and social skills. Other players are going to do things that upset your kid, inappropriate things, ignoring, bullying, etc. and if your kid is sensitive to these things or gets angry easily, Roblox is not going to go well for them. Stick to the under 13 games if your kid is actually under 13, and make sure you do this in the settings and create a PIN your kid can't guess. Watch for sudden changes in their attitude toward the game which could indicate they created a 2nd profile like my son did. And be prepared for angry protesting when you try to limit the game content or screen time...","Parent of a 11-year-old"
"age 7+","It is frustrating to see that all the money that I spent on my son’s account since the beginning, all of it, is gone to the hacker. All of the experiences and efforts that my son put into learning different games gone to hacker. The worst part is there is nothing you can do and nobody cares about it. This is something you have to consider, if you buy robux for your kid he will become a target for hackers
When I considered of allowing my son playing in Roblox, I though about the time he will spend gaming. Also, I looked into the bulling and inappropriate content practices. Yes, you have to be careful and follow what your kid is doing. In a lot of games more experienced players kill/destroy noobs. So, if your kid is sensitive it may become a problem. On the other hand, it teaches them some resilience. You can even turn it into lessons of kindness and compassion. That is if you follow what you kid’s experiences are.
The real problem is something that is beyond your control. Since real money involved in getting robux, there are numerous hacking traps for your kid to fall into. You can search topic ‘account hacking in roblox’.. There are clever strategies that hackers use to takeover accounts.
At the Roblox they even have tab what to do if your account is hacked. It would have been tolerable if administration of Roblox set zero acceptance of such behavior and froze such accounts immediately, pending successful return to rightful owner. Unfortunately, their response time may exceed several days.
In my case It has been already close to a week as I watch hacker enjoying my son’s account at my expense. I took a habit to request help three times day. There is nothing you can do. I canceled the premium features, but it will take another month, which means that next month, I will pay to hacker again.
The support feature of Roblox is very sluggish and incompetent. After four days they responded me with procedure that is posted in the website. By then, I had already tried it multiple times. The hacker changes the email address associated with account and gains full control. No reset procedures work.
As a game environment Roblox is good and it gives you opportunity to create your own games. This is something your kid can try if he wants to pursue this career in the future. The problem is the computer used for roblox will get compromised. Hacking is a world problem and there is no way a kid will be able to stay away from clever practices that work even for adult. Usually we try to stay away from such websites, but Roblox is a hacker prone environment and they do not care about it.","Adult"
"age 11+","the game is a fun multiplayer platform that can make your child have a fun time, the game is a huge sandbox where people can create their own game and world,you can also play other people´s creations and fun games,the game has in game money, wich you have to pay for, gives you access to perks and accesories for ur avatar,the cost isnt that high ,with 20 or 30 bucks you can get a lot of things, of course, the game might have a lot of non child safe places, and people might bypass the filter, but that is fine, there is a blocking sistem,for many people it may contain violent assets, but nothing that is bad to get it a 18+ rating, over all the game is fun for children and gets them a opportunity to meet new friends , but beware of scammers, just tell your child to ignore them!","Adult"
"age 9+","Its a game that my children play for fun. They Have Strait As. Its Not addictive unless u buy them robux. Dont buy them robux if u want them to be as good as my kids. If somebody cures the chat filter blocks it. If somebody says noob it means they are new to the game.","Adult"
"age 4+","When it comes to Roblox, there's many games to explore. My 4 years old kid plays Roblox (with my supervision) and I really enjoy seeing him smile every time he plays Roblox. As long as you have strict parental controls, your kid will be fine. If someone swears in chat, Roblox censors the word so that isn't one of my worries. Although there's many games to play, they often have scammers scamming people especially children. Just be careful in Roblox and supervise your child. Overall, it is a really nice game.","Adult"

"age 8+","I have had my daughter in hysterical tears twice in the last week because her pets were stolen or scammed away from her. Research online says this is a common problem. Reaching out to the company is unhelpful as you can only post an issue on a board and you get a response that it will be at least 2 weeks until they get back to you. Clearly this is an issue which must be addressed, and has not been dealt with yet. Even before this issue, I was worried about this game as its sole purpose is to trade with other people -- meaning you are constantly involved with other, unknowns online. I had told myself that as all you were doing was trading animals, and not sharing information, that might be ok -- but it turned out it was not. Additionally, the whole point of the game seems to be to convince you to pay real dollars so as to improve your situation in the game -- there are many things you simply can't do without giving additional $$. Which, while something that is not inherently a problem in an app, does put a parent in a situation of having to monitor and work with their children to decide what kinds of expenditures make sense. All in all -- the experience in our household with this app has been disastrous and I would recommend parents stay away.","Adult"
"age 10+","Don’t allow your kids to play it.
I’m trying to rectify the problem as my son asked for Robux as an in game purchase for various tools, clothing and access I assume.
I purchased or at least thought I’d purchase one of each Robux 400/800 etc. Initially it was fine. Then a couple of days- (not even one week,) go by, I’m getting multiple charges. Of the same amount. When I first started this review it was about 4 days ago, and as of today 10/06/2020 even after I’d called Apple to complain and they explained it was due to the fault of my sons iPad being linked to my iCloud, yesterday I was charged again. I’ve also messaged Roblox direct to have my son’s account terminated and so wasn’t expecting any other charge.
On checking my credit card however I’m finding each time he plays the game now, without my approval it’s repurchasing over and over again to almost the tune of a hundred dollars to date. And that’s in a matter of days not months.
From what I’ve just read, other users can scam the kids and basically steal from their account.
Something you’d have thought they’d try to get on top of straight away.
Update- Not sorted. Lost around $100. Robux is a scam and only for those with endless money.","Parent of a 11-year-old"
"age 10+","My son took my money and brought a new face, then he play some game called Arsenal and play it non stop so he wouldn't get off it. So then I told him to get off but he refuses, I even gave him a new bedtime schdule, but he's still play it. For my daughters, they play roblox games that has too much harassments, so they can get a little fight over things.","Adult"
"age 16+","My son has played this game for quite a few years. He is 12. I recently found out that kids/people can create ""sex rooms"" in this game. Some of it is referred to as getting/giving ""pipe"". The Roblox characters simulate different sexual acts. Lots of inappropriate stuff for kids. Is that kind of stuff allowed by Roblox? No, but it is happening. Do yourself a favor and do an internet search on ""roblox inappropriate"" and see for yourself.","Adult"
"age 18+","So, My child plays Roblox all the time. i asked him what game he was playing. He said it was called murder mystery 2. His lego person was bleeding, and being stabbed multiple times. i told him to play a nicer game. he played a game called island life. in the game there were people dating, being inappropriate, and swearing in the chat function. I HIGHLY Recommend Your children play nicer games, and be good kids.
Also, It said you could purchase this thing called Robux, The currency in-game to buy things. my child, Micheal, Was stealing my wife's credit card just for ""Premium"". Please Warn your kids to either play the Nice games on Roblox or delete it immediately after reading this review.","Adult"
"age 8+","So as i said in the title Roblox is one of the best websites for kids. I have seen some of the bad rewievs like some parents comparing it to call of duty grand theft auto and all of that stuff. This is not true although there are some game withing the website that may look similiar to call of duty and gta ( short for grand theft auto) it is not anything like it. In thoose games there is blood spraying you can beat up people and all that bad stuff. But in roblox there is no blood it s just blocky characters running around. Sure you can punch somone or kill in roblox but its nothing traumatizing for kids. There may be other kids saying bad things to your kid but your kid can block them so that they cant contact your kid ever again. And people may be making rewievs like its pay to win or you need to pay money. Just to clarify it is not pay to win and you dont need to spend a dollar in roblox. All of the bad rewievs are lying. I have played the game for myself and i can say what i said is true. Sure kids may get addicted but its not the games fault they are the game is supposed to be fun. If your kids get addicted thats all on you. Dont be angry on the game be angry at yourself. Think that maybe you should step in and put a time limit of how long your kids play the game, dont be mad at the game. Overall i would give this game at least a 100 stars if it would let me. So for the parents that are reading this if your kid wants to play roblox YOU SHOULD DECIDE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE HIM AND ACCOUNT. But i would suggest doing so. For the people that wrote bad rewievs STOP LYING YOU PROBABLY DIDNT EVEN PLAY THE GAME AND DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT. Thank you all for reading this rewiev. Stay healthy and have a nice day.","Adult"
"age 16+","my child has been crying all over day since this game called anime fighting simulator and ask for robux and this is the biggest regret

"age 6+","This game has lead my daughter to a job. There is a game she used to play, ""Welcome to bloxburg"". She started with a pre-made house and started building her own. She played this game for years and started to fall in love with arcitecture. As she became a teen, she read books and books about arcitecture. She graduated highschool and applyed for an arcitecture major univeristy. I will not say which one for my own privacy. She graduated with a arcitecture major. She looked for jobs and found a open slot. She was interviewed and on the spot when she showed them her designs she was hired. She is only 20 and already has a solid job and fiancee. Without this game she would be no where. Sure, there is some violence and innapropriete content, but every game will have that. I would like to thank ""Roblox"" for leading my daughter to greatness. I recommend this game greatly as long as you moniter when the kids are young.","Adult"
"age 5+","Its great My children love it maybe you your children a
Hour to play a day or if their good maybe 2 with the times they can only play it helps also for children under 13 it makes it so you can say words like {Love, Dumb, Stupid, Date,} and more the modration is great for how many people play this game i Think this is a great game for kids who love playing new Things EVEN create Games!","Adult"
"age 15+","Now Roblox may look innocent, but, some people can find ways to bypass the chat filter and say some pretty bad stuff. Some games in there is just too ridiculous, for example ""con sented"" that game contains too much bad stuff and people get to swear in it. Roblox also have those gang games some which mange to bypass the roblox filter and there is a lot of bad stuff in there. There is also robux scams which tricks kids to enter their password and steal their account. People also scams people in a game where they have the option to trade. If you are on a pc or a laptop you can play a game called notoriety where a group of 4 robs all kind of places. Last, the online daters. People sometimes date each other without knowing who they are.","Adult"

"age 6+","My child has been playing this game for almost 2 years now, And it's great.
But I do have a few Cons, (And Pros) That's mainly Customer Service,
The thing is, Recently I purchased some game currency for her, And it was fine.Until she purchased a Game-pass, That was her favourite game It was perfect at the time. But a few months later, The game got deleted I tried researching What happened for a while,And It seemed the game had got deleted Due to some sort of hack? She was disappointing as There was no point of her having to spend her currency for what? So I decided I would email them for a refund, I even had proof of my transactions But they responded with, ""Currently we are not able to refund"" And that's not a very valid response as This game has been around for a long time! And lot's of people have complaint Not even a more valid response instead the same reply. Although the game is great but that fix could make it a 10x better!","Adult"
"age 7+","I got it for my daughter and she played games like Royal High and Bloxburg. There are in-app purchases for a thing called ""Robux"" which I am fine with getting as long as my child has done something so it is a reward. However, some of these games do involve violence, but it is not at all comparable to GTA5. And some people have found ways to type offensive words. But there is a reporting system and Roblox will ban the account if necessary. Overall this game is pretty good.","Adult"
"age 4+","roblox is such a wonderful place to just communicate and talk to others. it expands your imagination and helps build your creativity. coming from a roblox player for 4 years, i have a clear vision on what roblox is and i completely recommend it for your child. you could make new friends and have loads of fun. the possibilities are seriously endless. my only real concern is that your child may stumble upon something you wouldn't want them to see. but there is a rare chance that would happen and i can guarantee that your child will have a blast when they start playing this game.","Adult"
"age 6+","First of all, when you make your account, you choose your username and password. Make sure to let your child be creative, inappropriate usernames are not allowed. When selecting age, make sure to make them 13+ if they are playing with their SCHOOL/NEIGHBORHOOD friends. The chat filter on &lt;13 is horrible. I had to deal with it and even ""ok"" can get filtered sometimes. Stay away from &lt;13 accounts.
Now, Games. Some games are non-family friendly, such as any murder mystery game or Arsenal and Piggy. Stay away from those games. Some games however are family friendly, and can make your kid creative! A game called Welcome to Bloxburg is inspiring me to become an architect! A game called Jailbreak always cheers me up, go put them handcuffs on them robbers! I recommend looking at the games your kid wants to play before they play them. Now, Roblox's currency, Robux. If you don't like to spend money on games, then, the only way to earn Robux is to develop a game using Roblox Studio. If your kid makes 100,000 Robux off of their game, and has a 13+ account, they can make that $350 USD. No, i'm not kidding! Developers of hit games are making up to $3 million a year. There are free robux websites and games. Don't let your kid visit these websites or play these games, they just are either wasting your time or stealing your account. Now we have, other players! If a random player is trying to friend you, do not accept. They can chat with you. You can disable chat however. Online daters are everywhere in role-playing games. They get banned and can't access their account anymore. If you want your kid playing with their real life friends or alone only, you can buy a VIP Server. Or install a chrome extension called ""BTRoblox"". This will let you go to the last page of servers and you can select a server with 0 players. Their friends can join them there. However, other people can join that server, paid VIP Servers are completely private and only invited people and friends can join. Roblox YouTubers can put content in their videos that's inappropriate for kids. However some are completely family-friendly in all ways. Some kids even have their own channel with a good amount of subscribers. That's it for this review, hope it was helpful. Oh and I played with my family once and my mom was giving A.I.'s virtual ice cream and she couldn't get the order right, it was hilarious. (This was in Bloxburg)","Adult"

"age 18+","I had a wake-up call when my daughter, unbeknowst to me had started using my credit card to pay for ""Robux"", Roblox's virtual currency just because she wanted her avatar to have hairs just like her friend's. When I saw the transaction on my credit card, I was not even aware she had created a roblox account and I didn't know what Roblox was truly about. Roblox's business model is similar to that of casino's for adults. It exploits player's addiction for the game and peer pressure to push them to buy - with parent's real money - the ""Robux"" virtual currency so they can progress with the game of even use some of the functionality. The site incites kids to spend money for almost everything, EVEN CHANGING THEIR USERNAME...Outright abusive. This business model should be illegal for kids. Many parents just like me are likely unaware their kids even created an account with Roblox as there are no safeguards to ensure parents are aware (kids can enter their own e-mail in the parent e-mail field....that is it...unacceptable). The games were so addictive to my daughter and peer pressure from her school friends so strong that unfortunately, one day she stole my credit card to be able to pay for Robux...to buy hairs and stuff for her avatar and access some functions....In talking to roblox customer service asking for a refund, this is a situation they experience EVERY SINGLE DAY without doing anything about it. If your kid is just creating a game for roblox, it is likely fine as he would be learning something (although he is likely learning as well how to abuse others) but if your kid is just playing countless hours, they are on the victims side. My daughter deleted her account - we discussed all the lessons learned for her from this: 1/ Beware of people exploiting other's addictions for money 2/Never join a game /site/app where you must pay to play or win or to change your username and settings 3/Ignore peer pressure 4/Never steal from anyone to satisfy an addiction 5/ denounce abusive sites like this one.","Adult"

"age 6+","ROBLOX has many scary games, with horror in violence. Some parents catch them playing this, and make them stop. It is an okay solution, but you can just filter off that genre and you can also limit what games they are allowed to play.
One example of a game people hate is ""Murder Mystery 2"". It is a game where you have to become a Innocent, Sheriff, or Murderer. If you don't like them playing it, just simply tell them that if they play those games, they will get in trouble. And if they don't listen, there will be consequences. Even if they keep doing it, they will eventually learn. Also, people being sent very horrible images and messages, you can block users on ROBLOX by simple clicking on their profile, clicking the three dots, and finally clicking ""Block user"". Also, some people are on the game just to troll.
Noob is not a bad thing to be called, it simply means you are a new player to the game. So if someone says ""You noob!"", they could simply mean that you're not that great at the game, because you are new. Also, I saw another review saying their son cried after playing a ROBLOX training game.
Those games are fine, but you need grammar to pass those trainings and you need to know what you're doing. Meaning, if you don't do that, your child will get kicked off the game. So the next time your child says, ""I got kicked off the game for no reason."" think about what could've happened.
Thank you for listening.","Adult"

There is guns, yes,Deal with it.Its your fault your shoving a screen in your childs face.","Adult"
"age 4+","I played this game for ages when I was a child. I have never had any issues regarding the community. The chat will filter swear words or other words which could be considered inappropriate. Roblox also takes down ANY and EVERY inappropriate game. There are educational games in there as well. For example, there is a museum game in it which you can explore and learn about the virtual exhibits i.e. Dinosaurs. Overall, Roblox is the greatest game for kids of all ages.","Adult"

I e-mailed the company itself to demand for a refund, however, they didn't do anything about it. the staff is so heartless. I hate this game.","Adult"
"age 13+","It’s a nice game for teens, teens can play Arsenal, phantom forces and other gun games. For kids, I recommend obstacle courses and tycoons. Make sure to tell your kids not to go into these “free robux” (robux is an in game currency) games , overall good for all ages.","Adult"
"age 8+","I think it’s 8+ because when bad stuff is made it gets taken down.The only problem is that kids can be lured onto other sites where they see bad things.Also don’t let your kid play if they would get traumatized by a Peppa Pig horror game or something similar.","Adult"
"age 18+","This game has other players that will try and manipulate and bully children. Once you report it, no action is taken. I have sent multiple emails only to be shrugged off and told it's not their problem. No apologies and no remedies. I will be removing this game app from my kids devices.","Adult"
"age 5+","My kids love it! ( one is 10 and the other is 6 ) we play alot and this should be for 5 and up","Adult"
"age 8+","Yes the other reviews are correct, there can be bullying and swears. But let's all be honest, bullies and swearing can be found everywhere. At one point or another your children will get bullied and will learn swears. Besides there are parental controls that restrict certain content from roblox.
Roblox can be useful as well, say you want to do yoga but your child is being noisy. You can tell them ""Hey, I'm trying to do something relaxing maybe this is a good time for your screen time. "" It really does engage children and sure getting kids to be quiet with screens isn't the best way, however, there isn't a parenting manual. Plus technology is advancing , sooner or later kids are going to learn about roblox.
It is also educational because it teaches you how to code. See, as my child started to play roblox, I learned that roblox is simply a collection of many ""mini"" games. One of which children can make or play games. It also teaches them different controls on the computer which as we all know is going to be important for their future.
In conclusion let your child play roblox and see how it goes, it may not be as bad as you think.","Adult"
"age 8+","Roblox is a game where kids can create their own accounts and play on their phones, computers, ect. There is a filter in place to block sex, swearing, and filters, such as d8 (date) and f***. Games might promote violence like murder and bots might scam kids for ROBUX and Roblox premium. To stop this, go to roblox.com, and log into your child's account, then click settings, and make sure the email is set to yours, (that way, the child cannot email support to remove controls, it will also let you reset the password.) Watch your child's friends list. To set up parental controls go to roblox.com, click on the top right SETTINGS, then click privacy and set t your desire. We recommend setting it up to the most secure setting and make sure to turn off messages. Ensure your child has privacy mode, or safe chat on by going to and roblox game, and look: Are there social links, Such as Facebook? Play the game, on the top right, does it say Account+13 or Account&gt;13. +13 means that the game thinks your child is over 13 and will not filter out much swearing, and safe chat and privacy mode is off. Fix that by going to settings, and click the birthdate and put the account to under 13. Go to your router and put parental controls and block roblox signup page, and, make sure you cannot create a new account. Talk to your child, block offensive games, and block the app on windows 10.","Adult"
"age 2+","the best website ever!!","Adult"
"age 7+","Some games on Roblox are bad, like Murder Mystery, Survive The Killer, and Piggy. I advise you not let your child play any of those games. Other games are good though, like Adopt Me!, Work At A Pizza Place, and Bloxburg. But there is also a lot of online dating. I think Roblox should put monitors in games posing as players to see if anyone is online dating. Oh. And the bullying. I was watching my son play Bloxburg and someone was bullying him saying that he was a ""noob."" I advise you don't let your child play violent games.","Adult"
"age 5+","Okay, this game/platform should not have a rating, considering that it is an online game, and those types of games do not have ratings if it is online. Also the fact is that many people use the platform as a way to make money, to pay their rent or their ROBLOX Premium Subscription so they can stay on the top of their game and push out updates for their games to prevent exploiters from raiding the game. its so over the top when parents say that their child sent pictures to some weird dude on the internet? thats not roblox, and thats slander against the company, for saying that. its not okay because you can't expect the companies like YouTube and Roblox to Babysit your kid. its not their fault they were exposed to that kind of content, its your fault AS A PARENT to parent your kids. its not their fault they were exposed to that content, its yours for nor parenting them.","Adult"

"age 6+","You should know roblox does not make roblox games. Players make roblox games. Here are violent games on roblox and some violent games are popular, The game does not have any sex in it and if it does roblox will ban these games very fast innapropiete images will not be shown and bad words will be a hashtag and bad words in game titles will be named (content deleted) and users that make games with sex and bad words will have a permament ban. Here is a in game currency named robux and they are not nessecary to play most of the games. There is no drinking/drugs and smoking, Games i would avoid for under 12 are: Murder mystery 2, Notoriety, Entry point, Jailbreak, life in paradise(has online dating) and any free robux game because they ask for account information.","Adult"

"age 6+","I think this is a very fun game! I have played it with my kids and it has not been bad whatsoever and I would recommend it to anybody who is 6+. The only thing you have to do is make sure they don’t play any shooting/FPS games.","Adult"
"age 7+","Roblox is a game where people can get creative and have fun. Don't be irresponsible and let your 7-year-old kid play it. And don't say it's for kids over 18, that's just stupid.","Adult"
"age 6+","It's a good platform and the best thing about it is that my kids never seem to run out of games to play. I've seen reviews of people claiming that there is sexual content on the platform, over the years my kids have played it, there has been no swearing or sexual references. I would recommend to check up on what they're playing whoever, because if your kids purposefully search for inappropriate content, they might find it. I think the responsibility for moderation falls on the platform (ROBLOX) and you as a parent. ROBLOX have done a good job of trying to prevent stuff like this happening. I think us as parents should also be monitoring occasionally. Only downside is that even though it may be free to play, you do have to pay some money for extras such as Robux and ROBLOX premium. There is the occasional rudeness on the platform but my kids know how to deal with it.
Recommendation to other parents: Monitor what they are doing on the app and make sure they have the correct privacy settings on. And don't feel pressured to buy and in-game extras as though are unneeded for basic game play.","Adult"

I think these parents are overeacting ,like if you don’t want them to swear then sit down and talk with them","Adult"
"age 12+","So..when my 10 years old son has stumbbled across a game called "" Roblox "" by The Roblox Corporation, I advised my son first that I will inspect the website and saw the violence-based games on the platform. Of course..not all of them were violence orientated but you get the point. As soon as I inspected it many functions I first began inspecting the games precise and...I know the violence is for the "" more "" mature audience of Roblox, but, honestly, it's not that bad. There is violence but there is no such things as blood. Then I began inspecting the platform for a perspective outside Roblox, it's advertising machine, YouTube. I saw channels with over 1M subscribers! Most of them where kid-friendly..but then..I saw the dark side..Code engine for Roblox! And soon enough I saw a title with "" ROBLOX IS BANNING NUMEROUS EXPLOIT CHANNELS "" I was curious as why the reason was. And then..they DEPLOYED RATS IN THEIR FILES! And then I stumbbled across SCENTED CON games..filled with profanity, no filter as I think they somehow disabled it. I quickly reported it and reported all games associated with it. Then I began playing the frontpage games. And honestly..they are pretty good! Well scripted..I MEAN VERY VERY GOOD SCRIPTED!!! Games as I remember..uhhh...Adopt me? Epic Minigames? Royale High School and much more! Roblox's biggest flaw are the people trying to give it a bad reputation as creators of SCENTED CON games from exploiters with scripts 18+ like Hentai, porn..You get the point. So, it's not that bad..well...compromising accounts, hacking, scamming..Roblox is an unique platform with an intresting playerbase, some of them kind, nice, funny and some of them toxic, racist and mean. Aside from that, Roblox is a good game!","Adult"

"age 2+","People... Its 2020... your child WILL add friends without telling you, your child WILL play shooting games, your child WILL do what he or she pleases because by allowing them to play Roblox games you are acknowledging the fact that they are mature enough to go out into the whole wide world of the internet without barriers (i'm not saying Roblox has no barriers, im saying the internet does)(&lt;---- That was for you overprotective parents, who by the way like to take my words out of context, or only read what you want to read). Roblox is a fine collection of games that are created by people... just normal people who want to make it in this world. I rest my case.","Adult"
"age 9+","Pros: you get to connect with friends,there are so many games to play,there is nothing to bad,you can have setting for kids,for parents can shut off the chat room and edit setting,inappropriate language is filtered, you can report Cons: some games has violence, there is blood in some shooting games, you have to use real money to get robux,you use robux to buy accessories but it does not really help you, you can buy game passes that cost robux,some games you have to pay.","Adult"
"age 12+","My daughter likes playing it with her friends. I feel that some of it can't be a little violent if they are playing certain games. So I don't like is she was banned for a few days it says for adult contain she plays the same three or four games she doesn't chat so I don't get what the adult content is. One game she was in contest for different costumes. I guess my thing is they banned for moderation yet their games can be very violent like cops and robbers or piggy she talks about.","Adult"
"age 5+","Roblox is a site for all ages, yes there are online daters, (Occasionally called 'ODers') Most parents would think this is wrong, but Roblox does not target any type of inappropriate behavior. Other than online daters there is violence, and drinking, the drinking is mostly 'grape juice' rather than wine, so it isn't too bad for younger children, the violence is not bad. There are some games like; Jail Break, Phantom Forces, Bad Business etc. you can easily avoid them, and make sure your kids play other games. Other than violence there is swearing and privacy concerns. The swearing is like again, not Roblox's fault, and you can easily block people that swear so you can not read their chat. The privacy concerns, is basically your fault. Your children are falling for fake 'robux' scams. It is not Roblox's fault. All together you only need to worry about your parenting and tell your children the rules of Roblox.","Adult"

Please let your kids play this they will be so happy!","Adult"
"age 18+","My youngest child is 8 years old and recently had this app downloaded. They would play very often and it was friendly up until a certain situation happened. I’m disappointed and my heart hurts for my child. Another player raped her character in a bathroom. You would think it’s “kid friendly”. My child had her account under 13 and I made well aware of that because when she would log on, I would check because I had recently heard some bad news about this game. This other player asked my 8 year old if they would like to see “his banana”. And persisted on dancing her on and inserting moaning comments and saying “give me more, I want more”. That is disgusting and vile. My baby cries sometimes about it, it can be traumatizing. I went through something similar as a teenager and I can see the fear in their eyes. Just because it happened over a phone doesn’t mean it doesn’t create trauma. I don’t recommend this game. I am not trying to cause problems in anyway, I simply just want to warn other parents and children about this game.","Adult"
"age 9+","","Adult"
"age 8+","Parents should stop lying saying that their child was sent inappropriate videos because you can’t even send videos in the app. Roblox is a game I recommend for 8 and up because you can set a pin and change the security so that your child can only chat with friends or no one and I only allow my daughter to play with her friends she has so much fun and has even unlocked he creative side and taught her how to code a game. There are some games that are recommended for ages 12 and up because of the blood and gore and guns but my daughter is only interested in playing those fun games like adopt me and meep city as well as royals high and hide and seek and you can restrict the games your children play also there is litterly no blood and gore your character dying is just them falling apart or transparent blood on the walls. Roblox is a fun game and I wanted her to have fun with it but also stay safe without me having to watch her like a half 24 seven and it worked about you put on the restriction and she only plays with her friends which she has seen in the real world. Roblox can actually also be educational and I read somewhere that they allow it in some schools because of the coding and real life like experience. I myself sometimes play with my daughter and it’s fine she plays with her sister and brother as well and it is a way from them to bond through a video game instead of arguing with each over what tv show to watch. Roblox is really fun and has really improved from the last time I checked it out and if your child has been nagging you about Roblox and your feeling skeptical It’s actually a great game recommend for everyone 10 and up but I say 8 and up. And don’t think that I am some careless mother who doesn’t care about what there children are looking at on the internet Roblox can also help teach them what is right from wrong and I’m also not that kind mom who likes to watch there child like a hawk when I added the restriction I am at peace in mind and the restrictions are strong and they have a CEO and a person who makes sure Roblox states safe. I recommend this 8 and up I am a happy mom","Adult"
"age 9+","I think that it’s ridiculous that people are falsely review this app. It’s absolutely great and my daughters account has never shown such things if u would have done your research you would know you can’t even send images it only words that filtered. I love the report abuse system. My daughter only plays with her friends and yesterday showed me a new game she coded I play with her and u can set up restrictions and control what games she play this is also teaching her wrong from right on the internet And I have to say it’s really run except if your child is about 7 years old I don’t recommend any scary games and you can block those too.When you block something u can put a pin and with me the restrictions have always worked and I checked out the website Corp.roblox.com I checked how u sight in watched some video and I was unsure about I decided to give a trial and I really really love it recommend it for 9 years and up","Adult"
"age 8+","For starters, Roblox is a game with an age demographic of 8-16. There is no pornography in this game like many parents say. There can be exploiters who break the code, but they are banned in a few days. Second, I see parents say the report procedure never finishes. Roblox has a very small moderation team, and Roblox has about 1 mil players per month. It's hard to answer so many reports at once. Roblox is always upgrading more and more, trying to fix these problems. It's not their fault about stuff like many parents say. Also, they OD is allowed in Roblox. It can happen, but it is against the Terms of Service of Roblox and the moderation team can't get anyone. It's not Roblox's fault there's exploiters and hackers. Roblox is all about being a fun, online game for kids. We know what Tomagatchis are, right? Because Roblox is their Tomagatchis. If you have a computer your kid can play it on, have them take coding classes if they're up to it. Roblox has a development game/app called Roblox Studio where kids and adults can make Roblox games. Every Roblox game comes from this studio. They can try coding games until they are proud of a game, which, with Robux, they can advertise on the page. They'll feel good about them selves and might even become a developer for Roblox games if they are determined. Roblox is about making the dreams of kids' possible. I would highly recommend this game for kids and teens, even to adults alike. I just wanted to be more fair to the Roblox team and shed some light to the real way it is. Parents just come in at the wrong time, with the wrong mind. I play Roblox, and I can truthfully review this game. Thank you for your time!","Adult"

It's a safe download, and if you have any trouble downloading there's plenty of avail to be found. As for the benefits of this site, it's a very good learning experience for your children. They learn about business and buying/selling, they learn how to engender games with the facile to find and very detailed game engenderment tutorials and scripting tutorials, putting them on the path to learning programming languages (The one utilized in this site is called ROBLOX Lua, it's excellent), and they learn about how to keep and stick to a budget. There's the option to upgrade your account to Builder's Club, and there are plenty of features to be utilized with this. However, the site withal has some imperfections. It's very facile for younger children to culminate up on phishing sites from bot-accounts made by the owners of those sites. Afore sanctioning your child to make an account, ascertain they are cognizant of web-safety and how to keep their account from being purloined.

I played Roblox as a child. The top, popular games are generally friendly, with any swearing or inappropriate behaviour censored as hashtags. Even if the odd curse word makes it through, it isn't much. When your child is at school they would swear a few times themselves. I was exposed to the ""s-word"" at 8 years old and the ""f-bomb"" at 10. And my grades were top, my parents taught me right. So to all parents, TEACH THEM RIGHT. These games are family friendly, my young son plays it unlimited, but with a screen recorder. He's played for a year and not a single curse word or insult has reached him (i am a gamer myself, i know ""noob"" and most other code-words in games) .And about Robux. ALL GAMES NEED TO MAKE MONEY. Yes, it is microtransactions. But that is expected in all games. You name it, FIFA, Minecraft, Clash of Clans, any popular game. Why parents are so annoyed puzzles me.

I didn't chat at all but I got approached twice on Roblox High School and talked to in a horrible way, I got called a noob, I was playing a game where someone had bought a boombox and played a song with the n word and the f word, I saw 'ABC for girlfriend' over the chat, people were roleplaying having depression in Royale High and Meepcity, I saw something about an 'OD squad' in several games, someone said 'giant t*rd' and it didn't censor, someone called trans people disgusting, I saw someone running around with a naked character, I've seen shooting games, trolling is encouraged, loads of stuff cost Robux, people were joyriding each others cars in Robloxia while saying 'hell to [user]', there is a fart game, people randomly turn innocent games into cults, someone asked me if I had coronavirus because my avatar looked 'very Italian', and people joke about autism. Unsurprisingly, my kids cannot play this.","Adult"
"age 10+","Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system that allows users to design their own games and play a wide variety of different games created by other users.
Sure roblox is a kids game, but there is much more to it.
Since roblox is for all ages, your kids might get annoyed by other kids. Since some online games unfortunately, have bullying, it can ruin your kid's gaming experience.
Robux is quite a issue. Your kids might get jealous by other kids with robux. What makes this worse is I have took into account that kids play on their parent's phone. Some parents have their credit card info stored on their phone. If that's the case, then your child may be able to buy 200 english pounds (what money is called in our country) worth of robux. Thankfully, Roblox's customer service is very quick, so you can likely get your money back if your child hasn't spent the Robux yet.
Adult content is pretty serious. I know Roblox is a kids game, but there is much more to that. Some bypassers can make games that revolve around pornography and drugs. But, their moderation system is quick to banning any inappropriate games,decals,t-shirts,etc.
The games. There are some games like Da Hood, which revolves around hood and gang. But, they have parental controls for a reason, and that is to block any inappropriate games.
The chat. Going along with that last topic, there is parental controls. And going along with adult content, players can talk pretty inappropriate by removing any words or doing a combination can let your non family talk go through.
And that is what you need to know about Roblox! This approximately took 6 minutes to write this or longer. Hope this works! :)","Adult"
"age 14+","I seen my child play some game called life in paradise and i watched him secretly and and other players was kissing and ""other"" players are doing sex roblox is a bad game with the bullies so roblox should be played for 14 and up and i forgot to mention the scammers want your passward for your money Never ever play roblox unless there 14","Adult"
"age 9+","I am a parent over a 10 year old son. He can to me asking to play Roblox. I said I’ll think about it then went on YouTube to check it out. Most other parents think this is a bad game. People age 12 and younger get what is called safechat which disallows many things. I helped him make his account, and he played a game named “Mad City.” It was a pretty violent, but I saw that he loved the game, and I let him play it. I see your opinion of there being bullies in the game. I myself have become almost an expert on the game, and if someone if bulling you either switch the game or do /mute command in chat. It completely muted the bully, and left my child in safety. I’ve also found out there are groups, and some are called “Roblox Career Groups” I joined one named “Pastriz Bakery” and the community was super friendly. I got my some introduce and now he’s loving the group. It teaches responsibility, respect over authority, time management, and so much more. There are also military groups and hotel groups to explore. Roblox is full of fun, and the reason Roblox doesn’t look at reports is because there are so many reports, and so little administrators. Parental controls are also a part of the game. My entire family now plays the game, and we all love it. I highly recommend your child begin with regular games, and then introduce them to those “work groups.”","Adult"
"age 6+","I've been playing video games almost my whole life, I experienced the ups and downs of many videos games and roblox is one of them at the start it may have not looked like a kids game because it wasn't well moderated, but now after some time the moderators fixed that and even got to the point where you cant type numbers, some emojis, curse words, and even the word frick. And yes the game is user generated and theres always going to be that type of person making games that aim for porn but no moderators are pretty quit and will shutdown the game and before uploading an image the mods will also review it and see if its kid friendly. You may see ads that talk about war or ,""Join this group to get this ___"" those are user generated ads they will not take you to any type website and give you a virus and it also blocks the app discord for texting and messages but can be used for many other disgusting things is blocked. I'd say this game is for 6 and up for all ages my 5 year daughter and 4 year old son enjoy playing the game and gave them some robux so they can pop out in the game.","Adult"
"age 10+","My Son has been playing for a couple of months now. I think he enjoys it but yesterday somebody typed ""cxxxuxxxm"" and the person told my Son to ask me what it was without the x's. I got really mad and asked them why they did it. They started Cursing and saying stuff like ""Fkuhcjk"". Roblox is a good Game. But i think they should make their moderation better. While i was doing this my Son also told me that there is a Report Button that got People Banned / Warned but it doesn't work anymore. I think they should update the Report Button so People like this don't Play on this Kids Website. Kids can play it But Parents should monitor their Kids.","Adult"
"age 4+","Roblox is a great game platform for kids. Small kids wont really understand most things. Older kids and teens will understand a lot. Youtubers such as Flamingo, KadenFumblebottom, KreekCraft, and more will encourage your children to play! I do agree with some other parents robux are expensive. Robux make children happy. There are some games that have hugging passionately but roblox Devs will ban them ASAP. Some people are very rude but thats just some people and there is no swearing. There are too many free robux websites but roblox cant fix google. So overall This game gets a 9/10 for me!","Adult"

"age 7+","Roblox is the best game i let my son play. This game is full of creativity the game is kid friendly i would let your kids play like 2 hours of the game so they dont get crazy about it. There are players on roblox that try to swear but roblox bleeps it out with a # so kids cant see it. And roblox has parent controlls. There is a friending in the game i would only let your kids friend people that you know or they know in real life. You can also block players you dont like such as bullys. Awesome game let your kids play it.","Adult"
"age 2+","all kid must play it!","Adult"
"age 5+","Roblox its not that violent. There are physics games, which you can control gravity, or RPGs, like Roblox-ified version of Undertale, Railway games, like Itty Bitty Railways (Costs 35 Robux, its in Beta) or Minigames. But there are some games (Arsenal, PF, MadCity or Jailbreak) that are a bit violent, there is no blood, It is just the character decomposing, like LEGOs. Then, the scammers... If you meet some of them do not fall the scam of free robux.
There are ODers (but that's a fact around 2018) There is Studio (Not for Tablets and Xbox) you can build games and earn robux. There is a Premium Membership (the first tier costs 4.99$ or €) Well Roblox its not that bad. Ah, one more thing, Do not fall for those parents saying Roblox has pornos or Pedos inside. It is just not true.","Adult"
"age 6+","I have been playing Roblox for about 3 years. Roblox has a great, perhaps overprotective moderation system. The blur out numbers, and curse words. I saw in another review ""a topless logo man"" that's stupid. That's what the characters look like. They don't have any private parts. Its just plain skin color over a lego type body. PARENTS! You don't have to worry!","Adult"
"age 8+","Hi, I have been playing Roblox for 6 years! Six years is a lot of experience. I am not an adult but a kid and I hate it when the news says Roblox is a something along the lines of, ""Roblox is a game full of pedos out to get children,"" and other things like that. Roblox is a family friendly game where all ages can play games and build games. Kids can learn to code on Roblox by making games.
Fun games I recommend would be Jailbreak, Arsenal, Piggy, Adopt Me, Booga Booga, anything under ""Learn and Explore."" I think parents should let there kids play Roblox and not listen to what the news is saying because that stuff is rare and against Roblox's TOS.","Adult"
"age 10+","This game called ROBLOX is a very good platform to learn, make friends, and socialize! However, if you not careful you can see various things that are very inappropriate. So when your going to try and play a game, go for the games on the ""Games"" page. EXCEPT FOR MEEPCITY!! STAY AWAY FROM THAT GAME! The security in it has never been fixed therefor it can be hacked and have violent content inside of it because of hackers. Overall, this game would probably be most trusted by more mature kids, such as 10 and up.","Adult"
"age 5+","I have been playing for 2 years and this is the best game ever.For those parents that are like ""bla bla bla too much cussing""Like shut up kids swear and you might not even know it they probably cuss at school.
Too much bullying solution go to another server prob solved.
I think that your kid will know if they are buying stuff with real money.
Oh the devs dont read the reports just because they have lives
doesnt mean they dont care","Adult"
"age 8+","(Let’s start out by saying I am an eleven your old kid but for some reason it would only let me sign up if I was registered for common sense media as an adult.) I think you need to know how responsible and mature your kid is before downloading this app. If you look hard enough on roblox you can find porn games that get banned in about a day. Those games go buy the name of con con con con so just inform your child not to search that up (I learned that those games existed the hard way.) Let me remind you that roblox is an online game that you play with real people and chat with but in settings you can disable chat. (Chat has strong sensors!)Some people (online daters) the most annoying people on this planet can be very inappropriate. Let’s just say roblox should delete all beds and actually have a system to report players that works. Roblox does have very fun games that range from non graphic shooting games with LEGO like characters to fun dress up and adopt a baby games. I met some really nice people on roblox that I play with online daily so I recommend you check it out with an open mind.","Adult"
"age 10+","Roblox is a online game, which you should monitor, in my experience, Roblox is a intresting game, it has a currency called ""Robux"" which you may buy by amnouts. Also there is a membership called ""Premium"" It works like this. You will recieve your selected amnout after a month. Be sure to set your (parents) email adress. Also let your children keep low profile, and dont buy alot of ""Robux"" cause children may get manipulated into inserting their private information in exchange in better items or more ""Robux"" or.. free ""Premium"" just.. don't do it. Now we get into the second part... the community, it's filled with people, or younger audiences who may swear with mispelled swearwords.. it oftenly appears on game known as: ""The Streets"" It's focused about being a ""Ro-Gangster"", shooting everyone else. This game has trolls, bullies, all sorts of stereotypes. Be careful, play games like ""Adopt Me"" and.. for your children to not lose focus or any sort of bad stuff. Be careful of games who have alot of bad stuff. People walking with dildos, or people killing over and over again, it's the exploiter, a local 13 y/o playing with their Lua scripts. Also the influencers : ""Youtubers"" KreekCraft is your local youtuber, streaming roblox gameplays, or rarely giving away ""Robux"" Remember to monitor your children, cause we have more! People doing romance, or sexual stuff are reffered as (Oders) Online daters, they are most likely 13 y/o enjoying their time, and jerking off on a monitor.

there are three things u should tell your children when they are playing roblox: dont ever play the game called meep city and most of simulator game becuse simulator game on roblox mostly pay to win, dont allow them to have robux and tell them the look dont matter, the skills it's the thing make u good at the game (also dont fall for the free robux scammer) and finally tell your kid ignore the bullies and toxic kids in the the game and only friend the person that u know IRL","Adult"

"age 8+","Roblox like all things need to be monitored by parents/caregivers. There are a ton of fun games for kids to get into but some violence as well. I recommend the under 13 feature, it has a heavier chat filter. My kid cannot type numbers or swear words in the chat. So it's almost impossible to give private information. But again monitor it! And I suggest play along. Enter your kids digital world and interact/connect with them in new ways.","Adult"

My 10 year old son has been playing this game daily and I was curious so I made an account in order to see what he was doing
First off when i joined MeepCity there was a character that had a circle pet thing named Mister steal your mans. Yes you heard me right, MISTER STEAL YOUR MANS I was absolutely shocked to see this in my son's favorite game list on roblocks! I joined another favorite game of his and it was titled Kohls admin house
When I entered,there were people with swords! SWORDS!!! I will not let my son play such terrible violenceing games!
Also I joined this island life place on roblocks and it had people being shirtless, kissing, typing inappropriate stuff via replacing letters with numbers, and having stuff like ""demon/devil/killer"" in their name descriptions!! I do not want my son playing such a game that allows this stuff
How dare the roblocks Had Mens allow this?! Very not appropriate! DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS PLAY","Adult"

But in roblox today I seen people kicking/banning people in server more no reasons,fights happen,swearing,and sex games and robux scams and hackers, Back in 2012 it was not like that it more a peaceful community in roblox and everyone was happy but now there smart mouth people ruining the game.This called cyber bullying and someone has gotta report it gets worse.","Adult"

However, there are some violent games here, so make sure to monitor your child. The safe-chatting feature allows communication within people at a friendly way.","Adult"
"age 6+","To start off, In my opinion, Roblox is safe for kids cause now that hackers have been stopped they can't do anything and Despite legos being naked they don't have any privates and Roblox moderation isn't as fast as lightning so Roblox Is a good game In my opinion","Adult"

"age 9+","As someone who has been playing since 2008, I think Roblox is good. theres a lot about it though. You need to teach your kid to stay away from predators or 3rd party apps and stuff. As well as nothing is free. Anybody who says that there kid has been raped on there is true. However, Its the parents fault for not teaching there kids this stuff. Now some of its good parts. Roblox has a lot of games for a lot of different ages. and your kid can be taught some things too like scripting. You can also make money on it by creating games and shirts.
Now, robux, is the in game currency, I recommend buying a little to start out with the limiting it birthdays and stuff. Plus, there are a lot of free items. Robux does costs money but its because Roblox is still a business. At the end of the day, Roblox could be dangorous but it can be easily prevented. Some other things too.
1. there is a report button for stuff
2. there arent many pedos, its usually just some kid
3. dont give out your adress
4. Is the internet, since roblox is free and anyone can join, it acts like the internet, there are some dark corners of the game but there isnt a lot. people are going to act like they are on the internet.
5. I say its a 3 star rating just from how good the game is in my opinion.
6. I havent been online in 2 1/2 years so it might be different.","Adult"

ROBLOX is a developing platform that ANYONE can use, there may be violence in some games but you can monitor your child and keep them away from specific games on the platform that you deem unsafe. The only real problems are botted users that my son's nickname for them is ""Scam Bot's"" there basically botted users on the platform bypassing the ""Filter"" (which is ROBLOX's filtering of inappropriate words on the platform, these bots have bypassed this and they put unsafe links on games which if your child is like 7 years old, he/she could fall for it, so warn your child about that, alright here I am for my title, a few parents/children have lied about the Platform saying that they have seen pornographic images and pedophiles on this platform, which is a lie, the ROBLOX moderation is quick to ban these if it even happens anyways.","Adult"
"age 15+","It had appropriate games at first, the graphics were very good, but, as the game got older, more people joined. Then they started making very DISGUSTING AND VIOLENT games such as 'Bloody Mary'. The developers do try to make it swear free but.. Everyone now is getting round it though. There is a TON of consumerism so BE CAREFUL!
The game might contain scenes that will encourage kids to hold knives, or other violent themes, guns and deaths, ALL THAT! I guess it encourages kids to develop[ but it's mostly just a game for adults to mess around in.","Adult"

"age 8+","Ugh. There is a LOT to say about this game. I have been playing for a long time. I know everything there is from Violence to Language. ROBLOX is a kids game that can sometimes be a little bit much for young kids. ROBLOX tried their hardest to keep RIBLOX family friendly from cursing or violent messages in chat. ROBLOX prevents most of the curse words but sometimes people sneak curses into words. For example they say you’re a SHITzu. Sometimes people get around being blocked by putting spaces in between bad words or put 0’s instead of O’s. So there are definitely people that get around the filter. People also give violent messages by bullying or just insulting people with every word they can think of. There is also violence in ROBLOX. No blood but there are lots of shooter games or stabbing games that the ROBLOX community makes. If you don’t already know. Every game in ROBLOX was made by a user. If a game is out of hand ROBLOX will remove it from the website. If a user breaks 3 rules they get banned. So you’re kid can’t exactly learn curse words from the website. Just be aware that there can be hurtful or violent messages. Every character in the game looks like a LEGO figure. But sometimes people can get away with wearing nothing on their character. But nothing is shown. It is almost as if you saw a LEGO figure with no clothes on.

What’s in the game?
Violence - Use of cartoony weapons in certain worlds. Roblox's information for parents says that all uploaded images, video, and audio files are reviewed by moderators before being allowed on the site, but at least one user reported that she's seen characters ""rape"" other characters, and videos of avatar sexual assaults occurring on the site can be found on YouTube. Sexual acts aren't visually shown, but the surrounding dialogue and images of characters being held against their will are reminiscent of this violent abuse.
Minor Language - Although the company claims to monitor and prevent inappropriate language with safe chat, users have reported open rooms and games that can expose players to inappropriate comments.","Adult"
"age 12+","I think it is a good game with a nice community (usually) There are Online Daters and Bullies who constantly Fight. I would recommend with care and monitoring your children.","Adult"
"age 7+","My friends and I play this game a lot together.
It's a great game for kids to play with their friends, and half the stuff about pedophiles on these reviews isn't true. If your account age is set anywhere under 13, it censors out numbers and certain words online. If people were saying hastagged comments in your game, that doesn't mean that they were swearing. The chat filter censors any words it doesn't recognize, so for all you know, they just misspelled something. The worst word you can say if your are under 13 on the site is ""hell"".
People say that their children found games with graphic material, or that they joined ""condo games"". These games are literally impossible to find, believe me, I went looking once to see what all the fuss was about. They are typically reported very quickly, anyway.
You can restrict chat for your children, if it is needed.
Online Dating is fairly common, and it can range from any people just saying that they are together to full-on sex roleplay. It mostly occurs in the game ""MeepCity"", though the game isn't meant for sex, players (Typically people on alternate accounts who just wanna cause trouble) sometimes attend large parties and put on suggestive outfits, have sex, etc. But your child can easily avoid these, and if they are caught up in that kind of thing, it's because they intentionally became part of it. There are always people who will try to do this kind of thing, and if you don't want your children exposed to it, then turn off their chat.
There is a chat filter, and it can be bypassed, for example, my friend and I figured out that you can just say ""$h!t"" in place of the actual word, but eventually it was removed from chat. The report system is unreliable, but if you report someone out of game (Go to their profile and click report), they have a chance of being banned. Certain games like Kingdom Life take safety very seriously and program their own report system that works much better than the normal one.
Your child shouldn't run into any inappropriate games if they stick to playing games on the leaderboard (And if they know how to correctly navigate leaderboard games like Royal High and MeepCity that attract Online Daters), which means that their in the 100 or so most popular games.
A lot of people complained about bullying and being called a noob (An obnoxious short for newbie) due to not spending money. While there is a prejudice (That isn't completely unfounded) against defaults, or ""Bacon Hairs"", there are avatar assets that don't cost money, like the Winning Smile, Brown Charmer Hair, Chill Face, etc. that won't get you harassed. People claim that being bullied online made their children cry, but if your child is so fragile that being called a noob emotionally scars them, then they shouldn't be using the internet at all.
Buying Robux is actually not a bad idea. Just five to ten dollars and your child should be good. If it gets to the point where they become so spoiled that all they do is beg for robux (My little brother, for example), then take away the app or make them do work for robux. My Mother buys a small amount of robux for my little brother if he practices his violin without complaint for a couple weeks, and it works for him.
Welcome to Bloxburg is a very popular game on roblox that requires 25 robux to enter (About the equivalent of 35 US cents, but the smallest amount of money you can spend on robux is a dollar). The game has a lot less bullying and trolling and dating than other games, because less people want to get banned from something they payed real money for.
So this is my evaluation of roblox, and I do believe that while the game does have some immature, sex-obsessed eight year old jerks that may try to ruin your time, you can find joy in it if you play it right.
By the way, this review was written by an almost-thirteen-year-old, but I wish that people wouldn't treat children as inferior or take them less seriously on these things.",""

"age 12+","Just deal in the fact that Robux (currency) is overpriced. A lot of people swear and cuss a lot because of one little thing. Some games have guns (Jailbreak, Asnenal, etc) and bloody images and faces (Mansion, Hotel, etc). So I recommend kids over 12 of age to play roblox","Adult"
"age 9+","I recommend this game for children getting their first phone or iPad. While there is some mild violence, overall it's a good game.","Adult"

"age 6+","Many parents seem to make ROBLOX out to be this terrible site for children and that it is not kid friendly. However, in reality, none of that is true if you just follow the right steps and set up your child's account for them instead of having them do it themselves. If you do this, many mishaps could be prevented and give your child an overall better experience.
When setting up your child's account. It is important to make sure that your child's birthdate is correct. This will allow ROBLOX to adapt what your child can say, see, and do on the platform. If you set your child's account to above 13 years, your child will have access to more parts of the platform. While under 13, will restrict the abilities your child has. This will make their experience safer and prevent them from doing things on the platform they shouldn't be doing.
Preventing unwanted players on your child's account. This is a very important aspect for any ROBLOX account. To prevent hackers from obtaining access to your child's ROBLOX account. There are three simple things that ROBLOX says to put to use. 1- Good Password 2- 2 Factor Authentication 3- Account PIN. It is first a good idea to a good password on your ROBLOX account. This will make it harder for hackers to log into the account. Write it down if you have to so you don't forget it! 2 Factor Authentication has two benefits, keeping hackers out, and keeping your child out of their ROBLOX account when they are not supposed to play. If you set your child's ROBLOX account up correctly with your email. You will have the ability to allow your child to play or not. 2 Factor Authentication, when activated, will send you an email with a code when the account is being logged into. You must enter this code into the 2 Step Verification on the App/Website to enter. Lastly, an account pin is a great way to keep your child from changing the settings around on their ROBLOX account. Simply turn on the Account PIN feature, set the pin, and there you go! You have now childproofed your child's account and hacker proofed your child's account!
ROBLOX Customer Service can be somewhat stressful when coming to terms with recovering a hacked account or handling billing issues. Roblox customer service is open 24-7. You can call ROBLOX to find out the times and to submit a Customer Service Ticket. All of ROBLOX's services are given through email. If you're planning on having your account recovered quickly, you have another thing coming. Realize that a hacker will do anything to keep a ROBLOX account in their possession for as long as possible. So they will make fake reports against you or your child and accuse them of hacking. ALWAYS PROVIDE PROPER INFORMATION to ROBLOX when is comes to recovering an account. This includes a billing email, original registration email, and the username of the account. If you provide the following information for account recovery, it will be a breeze and take about 48-96 hours to get an account back.
To prevent having to recover a hacked account in the first place. Make sure to do the following:
- Set a verified email address and phone number.
- Have a good password for your child's account.
- Keep an eye on your child and keep them away from scam websites such as ""Free Robux Generators"" and Promo-code websites. ROBLOX will always release promotional codes on Twitter.
- Make sure your child is not giving their password out.
- Make sure that billing information is kept hidden from your child.
Do the following and you and your child will have a great time on ROBLOX! Have fun!","Adult"
"age 8+","Everybody is saying Roblox is terrible and scary, my two oldest sons have played it since they were like four! If you don't want your kid to see bad things and stuff, you put in your real birthday and they will get safe chat. Its automatically its not your choice even. If your kid is 13 or older they won't get safe chat! Roblox is a great learning community as long as you monitor your children and make sure they aren't doing any bad things on it. If your child says their age it will automatically get tagged DUE to safe chat. Even if your child doesn't have safe chat they will still get numbers tagged due to people giving out numbers, ages and etc. I say you should allow your kid to play roblox! Yes there are some games where there is REALLY bad stuff but they automatically get deleted! If your child comes across these games and you catch them I strongly suggest you make sure they don't play roblox anymore.","Adult"
"age 10+","Some people underestimate it! It’s had a huge change and that’s why the player numbers have gone sky rocket high! I think it educational as well as a fun, safe environment! Without safety things turned in obviously it’s very bad for you g kids but now my kids are safe online","Adult"

"age 10+","My little son johny asked me if he can download this game called *rublacks* and i let him.After few weeks he asked me to buy him *rabuxs* and i asked why,he said he wants to be thicc in this game,then i gave him my credit card and i said buy these *rabuxs* only using 1$ dollar,then after few hours i got a message that my little johny bought 500$ dollars worth of *rabuxs*,i said WHAT THE HELL did you spend it on and he said : i spended it on this game jailbreak and i bought cash for my gurlfriend,then i turned off the wifi and went to poop,when i came back he was playing and eating while playing,he became from little stickman johny to BIIIG fat johny,parents dont let your kiddos play this game it will make them biggg kids and fast.","Adult"
"age 10+","I think that Roblox is good for kids. I am a 30 years old mother and I play this game with my son over 2 years now. Yes, there are some violent games but you can just tell your child not to play those. There is a chat filter so if someone says something bad it gets censured yet there are some ways to bypass it. Even if you don't want your kid to chat with people on the game you can just easily turn off the chat. Easy as that. And if you still don't trust your kid on the site then just monitor your child while they are playing video games. Thank you for reading this review and have a nice day. :)

"age 9+","Roblox is a safe game. You cannot send images through chat. All images and sound uploaded to roblox are reviewed by the ROBLOX moderators before being published. The game has a filtering system that blocks a lot of bad words and stops you from giving out things like emails, phone numbers, passwords and addresses. ROBLOX is a free game, it is completely optional to pay. If someone wants to message you on roblox they first have to send you a friend request and you have to accept it.","Adult"
"age 8+","You guys with the fake reviews are silly, this site is safe. I have two boys that play ages 8 and 14, clearly, some of you need to really sit down and pay attention to what your child plays as any parent should. I have seen a few spammers, but they are easy to report to the developer, not once have I seen sex chat or adult pics. You people are just bored and hateful. Roblox mom and gamer.","Adult"
"age 18+","Roblox is bad cuz they don’t know ya y’all y’all liken robux cuz dominus to expensive price Ike mil obit","Adult"
"age 9+","Certainly not for kids as my kids at school found out. Too much violence, swearing, online dating etc. These kid called Kreekcraft and username even says it's for kids when it's clearly not as I stated. Not sure why Roblox just makes it a 18+ game because that's what it should be. Very inappropiate for kids and I would avoid it
Furthermore, as I am a teacher, I have found some kids who don't do their school work and homework becasue they are too busy playing Roblox, even their parents can't watch them 24/7. Too addictive and I would limit on how long your child plays Roblox.","Adult"
"age 16+","My 10 year old was watching someone named ""Kreekcraft"" and he was play some game called ""Jailbreak"" and he was killing people for MONEY. So i told my son get off that video don't let ur kid play this stupid game!","Adult"
"age 4+","ROBLOX is a online multiplayer game and is safe for kids. The parents are right in some points. There is a lot of toxic players but there is also a feature where you can block. Click their username and press block. TADA now they cant see their messages. and if you don't want your kids playing a game and they play that game do not blame ROBLOX tell them next time if you see them playing that game punish them. (if you want) this game is great for ages 4 and up that know how to use a computer and not get scammed by scammer.","Adult"
"age 9+","Roblox is money grabbing. They took away events and Tix, which was great for my daughter as I didn't want to pay real money for Robux or to purchase clothing. It won't be long until many games will require a monthly fee.
Games are not that good either. What's the point in playing a game where you do the same thing each time? and for what? once you get everything in game, why play it without rewards being great? I think some youtubers are sometimes hyping their favourite games, only to be disappointed with the updates. Such as Kreek, Usernamesthis, Lisbokate, Napkin, denis etc. Some games only become great for a day or two after a update, then back to normal.","Adult"
"age 5+","So,this game is basically the best,sure,it has other violent,apocalyptic games,roleplay games that are meant for 13+,families,expect swearing and....""rape"" culture,pft,funny how much you guys think that's it.","Adult"

"age 10+","I have a kid myself that plays Roblox. This past weekend he was playing a game, There was knifes, People bleeding, Dieing and Bullying. I told him to leave the game. He played a game called ""Piggy"" There was cartoon character spanking them with a bat. I said Leave the game. He did. Ofc I had to find a game for him. I found a game Called Bloxburg, But it cost Robucks, My son stole my credit card and spend it on 10,000 robux. He ""Roplayed that he was in car crash. Here where the Sex and swearing comes in In a game called Scented Con (I tried the game my self) There were private parts and people having sex and swearing like ""Want to f with me?"" Also there a bunch of hackers on roblox, There good games on roblox and bad games. I give roblox a 5/10","Adult"
"age 18+","Roblox is not a game for kids. It involves violence. You can jump in this game, if you jump of the roof you will not die, making the kids think it's okay. My daughter is 3 years old, she downloaded it and was addicted to it. Then she met bullies and she went up crying to me. I deleted the game from her rtx 2080 pc, and installed gta 5 instead, less violence for kids!","Adult"
"age 2+","Life is stable I don’t get nagged and I’m happy.","Adult"
"age 10+","Only roblox has hackers and scammers, its pay to win, trolls that bypass the chat, and too much violence. Its fine if kids below 13 should play roblox, make sure to keep a eye on what there doing. Make them not join violent games and tell them not to fall for scams.","Adult"
"age 7+","This game is a great game, it has educational values to it, such as learning to build on write code on a computer. This game builds good values needed later in life.","Adult"
"age 18+","So I gave permission for my youngest, (7) to sign up for an account to Roblox using my email. Later in the day I heard him shout ""Die"" and other inappropriate words, I decided to take a look what he was grumpy about and on his recently played section i saw ""Phantom forces"" and ""GTA Blox city"" And he asked me for ""Roblox Money"" As known as, Robux I immediately uninstalled the game from the family computer and put a more complex password on his account. I do not recommend this game to ANYONE under 18.","Adult"
"age 10+","Roblox, roblox is a great game. With great games. Although. The community is trash and most people you meet in roblox is either rude or just annoying. Every time my son plays this game he always tells me about how people hack and ruin games what have an objective to do a certain task. On the other hand I do see the greatness in roblox and why children play it and enjoy it. All in all I wouldn't recommend this game to children below 10. Not because they can't handle it. Just because of some of the things you may see in the games roblox has to offer.","Adult"
"age 6+","I am a parent and my kid plays Roblox a lot but he has a Youtube Chanel with almost 16k subs and i like him recording videos but i tell him don`t play too long and when i check the mail i get something from Youtube once in a while and they give my son some money for his Youtube Chanel and i was so proud of my son that he could do something by him self and i think Roblox is the best game in the world but don`t play too long!","Adult"
"age 10+","Roblox is a game where you can play with friends and other people! It is good for children and teenagers!
For all the parents who is complaining about Roblox:
If your child is seeing some gruesome scenes, innappropriate stuff, swearing, bullying, etc. You should not ground them harshly, just talk to them nicely and tell them not to play those games and block those who are bullying in Roblox. Roblox does not read reports through game. They only read reports through email.","Adult"
"age 7+","So my daughter played this game and saw a youtuber, who she said is kreek-craft who called salad hair stinky and police having no lives. She used this on real cops and the police told me off. Could've been worse as I could have been arrested. She also hates salads really much and thinks people's looks are very important. Roblox should do better to protect our kids. Prevent playing the game that is unsuitable for kids, get rid of this bacon v salad thing because youtubers ruin it.","Adult"
"age 10+","Roblox is very nice!","Adult"
"age 10+","Avoid at all costs. My kid saw this guy on youtube, I think his user was kweekclaft or kdeekcraft or usernametwis or something [apparently he said that he found this person after he won something to do with battling other youtubers] Saw that he got millions of cash in some game and got really jealous, so he stole my credit card and actually used it to get money. Thankfully I caught him before he took too much of my hard earned money.
Parents: be careful, hide your credit cards, look at your bank statement etc. Your kids could be up to no good.","Adult"
"age 18+","My child played this game and sombody asked him for his credit card number! The game is very disturbing because the small lego men die and are dismembered. I will not let my child play this in my christian household ever again!","Adult"
"age 9+","roblox can be a good game at times. like when your playing a game called bloxburg which my son told me about which is like being an adult. becaus you have to buy a house. you have to take care of yourself and get a job and starting to pay bills. its like getting prepared for adult. and other games where you are supposed to build. so you can unleash you creativity. but it does have its down sides that can affect you and your son. like the thing called robux. which my son always whants. and there is hacking. so it really good. but i have a suggestion. dont take away roblox. it will afect you even more. so just let your son at least 1 or 2 weak days. and 2 or 3 week ends.","Adult"
"age 8+","i’ve been reading these reviews from other parents and i’ve seen a lot of parents say roblox has cursing, violence, and scams. i am aware this is true but there are many ways you can prevent your child from seeing these things. roblox has chat filters which doesn’t let anyone curse yet sometimes kids are able to use numbers to make out curse words. if you don’t want your child to see these curse word then you are able to get a safe chat. some games do have violence like shooting,killing, escaping prison and more but there are also other games that are good for educational reasons like the school games where you actually learn things and take test. a lot of parents complain about their child spending money on the game or getting scammed. if you don’t want your child to spend money on the game simply say no, and the only way your child can get scammed or hacked is if they give out their password.","Adult"
"age 18+","I have been playing roblox for long time the moderation/report management/control system etc sucks I tried to report someone for harassment on me and my friends and they dont care about what people say and no wonder why cant they get it right -_-","Adult"
"age 13+","it can be a good game But also a bad one PEOPLE PRENDING TO BE BOYFRINDS AND GIRLFRINDS AND PEOPLE ASKING FOR PERSONL INFORMATION","Adult"
"age 5+","Sure there must some inappropriate stuff, but remember that it also has good stuff like ""hide and go seek"" and ""adopt me"". Yes there might be swearing and online daters, just tell your son/daughter IF they ever see a bully, a online dater, or even some people swearing tell your kid to leave the game that he or she is play another game like adopt me. ROBLOX might have a lot of bad but also good. if any parent that rated this game 1 star, just remember that ROBLOX has good stuff too.","Adult"
"age 7+","I think this game is fun for my child I have told him that if anyone offers him something that he should say no unless it is not bad or anything. I saw one review that said that it was 18+ because they die and fall apart. (Also they called them Lego boys XD) Honestly they make a funny sound when they die, and there are a lot of kids games where you can die, like, you would SOOOO hate Minecraft, and even I think Minecraft is fun, so you are soft. They have a filter for inappropriate language, and the only questionable usernames I’ve seen are like “poopybutt14” and stuff like that, like funny stuff. So, I think they are teaching kids about life with humor, fun, and social interaction. There are scammers, but most of them are SO fake.","Adult"
"age 6+","You all think its Roblox's fault for all these inappropriate games. It's not Roblox's fault it's the people on Roblox. In Roblox there is a thing called Roblox Studio were players create their own games. Roblox is not making the games its the people on Roblox.","Adult"
"age 2+","It is a good game to teach kids about future stuff that could happen.

"age 18+","This game needs you to buy something called Robux or Builder's club with real money or you can't get items for your avatar, it doesn't like it said in the AD be anything you can image, and lots of people are online dating in the game such as life in paradise.","Adult"
"age 12+","So I have Roblox and I don't think it's for younger kids because people swear on it it isn't Robloxs fault some people just let Thier kids on it and just don't care what they do about 6 times i have seen someone swear jailbreak is a great game it's just that someone time when a player gets arrested they swear at other people using number and letter and space bars to say swears the game is brilliant in many ways you make friends and you can chat to them help them play the game and once someones your friend there tour friend forever in there I love the game it's quite addictive kids always want robux so maybe they can use Thier one money to buy it overall it's a great game it depends on what game your playing like adopt me if for five year old any way I hope this review gives you. Insight into that Roblox is","Adult"
"age 2+","I think Roblox is good since it has educational games as well as the violent games. After my son, Tim played it he got straight A's on his report card and exams. Therefore, i would recommend Roblox to all parents.","Adult"
"age 8+","You may think after browsing this site, ""Roblox is not for kids!"", But hear me out. Roblox has games for all people. Yes, there are games with violence, but you can just choose to not play them! You can also block your account from going to certain games, in settings. Now you may be saying that there's language, well, the filter can never fix everything, and no matter what, someone will bypass it. Although you can report a player for swearing, and they will most likely be banned. What about online dating? Just report them and leave the server! It's really that simple. To anybody reading this just think, can Roblox be perfectly clean? No. There will always be someone, somewhere, doing something innapropriate.","Adult"
"age 12+","So Roblox is the imagination Platform that allow players to build and play almost anything they can imagine. they can do that for Windows And MacOS with an app called ""Roblox Studio"". you can create anything that you can imagine. but it is concerning sometimes for children. sometimes i see people swear in my sons roblox game. and there is violent games for example your goal for a game called ""Jailbreak"" Is to escape prison, rob banks and other stores, and kill cops. and there are things like guns, weapons etc. which concerns me sometimes.","Adult"
"age 18+","BAD DONT PLAY!","Adult"
"age 10+","Hello! For those of you that are reading my review, I'm Alex and I'm currently an active ROBLOX developer for multiple less popular games you may have seen or heard about.
While it is true, that most of the parents have a point it can be addictive, It is not directly the fault of ROBLOX that their children don't have a good interaction with their parents over Roblox. I still play Roblox with my mom sometimes, and we have a great time. I would, encourage you, if you're having a problem with your children not having good time management skills, to get them to join a group that encourages it! There are multiple groups out there that at certain points tell you or your child indirectly ""Hey, There's nothing else to do right now. Come back on tomorrow/later for another event"". Those groups helped me learn how to log off when I felt like I was on for too long, or done with the day's activity. If this isn't working, just try and connect with them and play their favorite games with them and see why they like it so much. I wish my parents did that with me when I was that age, but they were always too busy and now I still hold that fact over them.
Moderation, I agree, isn't the best but when you take into account that Roblox has about (at the time of this post) 178 *million* accounts, moderators can't read every single report as quickly as you'd like. You have to remember that the Roblox moderation staff is maybe close to 200 people? If you factor that in with how many reports they get per *day*, then you start to understand why it takes so long for reports to take effect. Moderators are not robots, please do not treat them as such.
While I agree the platform could use less pay to play aspects, the majority of the platform is free to play unless you want to buy robux or premium membership for your child, and if you think you can just google ""free membership/free robux"" then it does not work that way. You need to buy said robux/membership, wherever you want to buy it. Even if you use an external site to buy cheaper robux, like V3rmillion, you still run the risk of getting scammed by a user that's not trusted in the community.
If you're one of those parents talking about how the website gets ""Hacked constantly"", Let me explain how you're wrong. Roblox itself has never had an actual attack with professional scripts or data stolen. What you are describing are Exploiters, People that use free or paid injectors made by other people to inject scripts that alter the client/server of that server only. Please do report these people using the report button, I do promise you that exploiters do get removed from using the platform.
I hope I could lay out all the points I saw people complaining about. If y'all have any other questions about things relating to Roblox, or would like me to teach someone on Roblox how to use Roblox Studio (the development program that comes with every installation of Roblox) to email me at: sglassscp@gmail.com","Adult"

"age 18+","Your child is allowed to socialize I mean come on! The game is just to inappropriate for kids
I went on to my daughters account and saw that she was making friends with people that she didn’t now in real life, also i joined a game called (How to make friends in life and how to get a good education and good grades) now that just pushing it to far I mean what parent would want any of those terrible things for there children. And you can say mean words in the game chat and they won’t even get blocked, one player was wearing a t-shirt that said ( 2+7=? clearly that is teaching your child to write ? as there answer on math tests.

"age 3+","My child (aged 6) uses this game to explore the online world. There is no profanity in chats, Roblox censors them, and in some games, you may escape a prison, rob banks, steal cars, but this has no effect on my child, it is simply a way for them to be imaginative. There is also an in-game currency called robux, this is something you purchase with real money, but it is very hard for children to get a hold of, they need to put in your address, credit card number, CVC, a child probably knows nothing about that, so how could they waste money? This game is not just for kids, adults play it all the time too!","Adult"

"age 11+","I think ROBLOX is a great game! it's honestly a great game to play with. I tried to get my son, my daughter out of the house and spend time together but all they want to play is ROBLOX. so I bought myself a laptop and told them that we should play ROBLOX together. they didn't look happy, more full of... cringe? and honestly, I wasnt looking for that as well since I need to be responsible around the house, but I never got to hang out with my kids so I just left dinner, since my husband could do it for today. so we were playing this game called ""Adopt me!"" game. it's where you can roleplay as children or parents and they could learn from it, I even teached them a bit about parenting, I've seen the revies that it's full of sex, violence, even kids swear. I mean kids will swear one day or another, it's just how life goes, I am not ready for my kids to swear so I turned their chat disabled. you can also do that by clicking the gear icon and going to settings and pressing privacy and scroll down to see ""who can chat with me"" you can either press everyone or no one, i pressed no one which means my daughter and son wouldnt chat with strangers, like pedophiles and stuff like that. they usually play this weird pizza game, so they never communicate anyways.","Adult"

Multiplayer shooter games, roleplay and heist games. On Roblox theres a currency called Robux which you can get in multiple ways you dont always need to buy with real money. With robux you can buy new hats shirts pants or gear. This is also a really good way to teach kids to code with roblox studio when you get the real game youll have to download Roblox sudio with it.","Adult"
"age 10+","Parents need to know that Roblox is a game-creation website where users design and upload their own games -- and play ones other people have created -- in a multiplayer environment. The site offers a safe-chat mode for those under 13, and parents can restrict their child's chatting capabilities. Roblox's free-and-open communication policy --including the ability for unregistered users to chat -- means that your kids' interactions can vary widely, from legitimate player engagement to potentially risky involvement with predatory users. We recommend parents disable the chat functionality as a protective measure when parents can't supervise kids' play. We also recommend that parents set a four-digit PIN code that will be required to make any changes to their child's account, preventing kids from giving themselves broader access, and change the security settings to only allow kids to access a curated list of age-appropriate games. There have been reports of users thwarting the chat and exchanging inappropriate/predatory messages with young players; some kids have also been exploited by predators through the site. Despite Roblox's efforts at policing itself, including human moderators, digital-civility rules, and other measures, it’s dogged by users with bad intentions, both on the site and off, such as on YouTube, where users upload inappropriate Roblox game clips.Kids can obtain Robux, the in-game currency, by selling game passes, which give players special perks and abilities in games; signing up for a paid Builders Club subscription, which also allows you to sell shirts and other items for a profit; or by purchasing them with real money. As always, it's a good idea to read the developer's privacy policy for details on how your information (or your kids') is collected, used, and shared, and any choices you may have in the matter; and note that privacy policies and terms of service frequently change. Parents who have additional concerns about Roblox should check out Common Sense Media's Ultimate Guide to Roblox. It should be fine for kids aged 10 and up.","Adult"
"age 18+","My daughter heard about this site from school and begged me to get her on it. So I did. Purchased thousands of dollars in Robux over the years and then suddently Roblox deleted her account. They have no one asnwering their phone and email and the account and all of that money is gone for good. Keep your kids away from this money trap. Only let them play the free games and do NOT buy ANYTHING.
Oh, and lots of inappropriate people and situations that take place on this site, including online dating.","Adult"

"age 7+","Roblox can be very fun, a lot of games, You can get free item to customise your character, although Roblox isn't can have people swearing, but that is guaranteed on a online game. If your child is under 13 it will have a stricter chat filter, which words such as ""Gay, Lesbian, idiot, stupid, ass"" will be censored, and pretty much every swear word is censored. There can be some pornographic games on Roblox, they'll usually pop up now and then but the titles of the games are usually ""con_sents"" or ""sents_con"" If you do play Roblox, look out for scammers, they will say ""tell me your password for robux""","Adult"
"age 8+","Yes ROBLOX is flawed in many ways, but it's the internet there are bound to be rude and disrespectful people. And yes there are going to be immature 12 or 13 year old's but that's just ROBLOX, it's for all ages. They cannot restrict it to a certain part of people, if they did it would make it unfair. You can't keep people from playing, the admins/moderators take action only if you report people and if they see someone breaking the guidelines in-game. (To report someone on ROBLOX click Report Abuse) If someone is harassing you're child or you leave the game and report them under the CORRECT category, there is NO WAY a man can get you're location unless you're child gives them it. (this includes iplogging and clicking on suspicious sites.) ROBLOX Moderators know about robux scams. If you don't like roblox that's O.K but try and remember it's the Internet, every game has it's pros and cons.","Adult"
"age 4+","I have played ROBLOX since 2016 and let me tell you: “Their are some inappropriate things on the site BUT all of them are easy to avoid them.” Their is literally a report button next to almost everything you need to report!!! So please don't be freaking out about ROBLOX. Shooters can be bloody but they can easily be avoided so don't overreact when you find your kids playing it. Anyway its a great game so they will probably enjoy it just as much as i do.","Adult"

"age 7+","This game is actually really good. It can teach your kids how to script and that could maybe help them in the future with coding.Also , ROBUX doesn't make you pay after you buy it that's for BC. (Builers Club) And the reviews with ''Swear words'' in ROBLOX is not true. You can only swear if ROBLOX filter doesn't detect it and there are some sex games witch you can only find by typing in a pesific name in the games search. Such as Con con con con con. However , they get banned in 10-15 minutes. But anyays ROBLOX is amazing. There are only a few bad things but they get banned.","Adult"

"age 7+","ROBLOX is the best game I have ever played with my son. He always wanted to play ROBLOX to become a Police Officer! When we played Jailbreak, he was able to arrest prisoners. But when he died, he would learn to be very careful.
Also, with my daughter, She would always want to be a princess. We played Royal High, and it was not bad. She could just block the people “roleplaying” and move on to become a princess!
I just play the game for fun. My favorite games are: Work at a Pizza Place, Jailbreak. Bloxburg, and many more!
ROBLOX is safe, because there is 2 step-verification, parental controls, and good moderation. Other parents &amp; toxic kids are raging over ROBLOX, and have NO IDEA people do ROBLOX as jobs on YouTube lol","Adult"
"age 12+","Look, I've played Roblox myself. It's full of really great games. Some of them are fun and creative. But...the whole thing is ruined by bullies, who infect every level of the community. I'm a teenage boy, so I game a lot. I've played in many different communities but...wow. Roblox is TOXIC! I've seen kids get told to kill themselves, called horrible things like r*tard and f*ggot and unfortunately, the general attitude is indifference. When confronted, these bullies seem completely unrepentant.
The ""Report"" feature does nothing. In fact, another feature that has ruined this game is the ""vote to kick"" feature. Ideally, it's supposed to allow the players in a particular server to kick an unruly player from the game. However, I've many times seen it used to harass and threaten: A group of bullies will join a game and kick out anyone who tries to stop their rude behavior. It's pretty horrible.","Adult"
"age 14+","This game is not appropriate for elementary students at all. I fee like I have failed my daughter because I didn’t know how bad this game was. She is 9 and it has ruined her life. I had no idea of the sex and violence this game had and after she came forward due to her guilt and started telling me of all of the specifics in tears I am enraged. My daughter has images she can’t get out of her head of sexual simulations and now she is transferring it to real life. I may need to get her therapy because of this game and I only blame myself. All I can say is BEWARE PARENTS and don’t let this happen to your child. My daughter has said to me she believes she has lost her innocence and that is truly heartbreaking. I am sick about the money I gave her for this game.","Adult"
"age 9+","ROBLOX is educational for every age","Adult"
"age 13+","The goal of the games are to buy as much as you can to “create” things but honestly it is just a house of cards. Awful. The game makers haven’t seemed to have the will to do the right thing and protect kids from being scammed. My daughter worked for months to get a certain pet in one game and in a matter of minutes she fell victim to a fake trade and lost everything she’d earned. Maybe a good life lesson but seems unethical at the cost of padding game developer’s bank accounts.","Parent"
"age 13+","Roblox is a multiplayer website with very BAD games. my 9 year old child wanted my permission to play this STUPID game. me, so dumb enough, let them play it. 10 minutes later, I checked on them and they were playing inappropriate games with violent actions, bypassing messages, and disturbing images and places!!!!!!!! DO NOT LET YOUR CHILD PLAY THIS GAME IN FACT, DO NOT LE T THE WHOLE FAMILY PLAY IT ITS BADDDDDD!!!!1","Adult"
"age 14+","Roblox may seem really innocent on the surface, but oh I assure you, surprisingly, in a game where you literally play as a sentient lego, there is subcultures which could harm your child's innocence. Take for instance, online daters and condos. You can find these creepy online daters literally anywhere in online games. That includes club penguin, animal jam, Fantage, movie star planet, You name it. However, late at night, older people who play roblox like to copy and paste these ""condos"" on to the site. Condos usually get shut down within a ten minute time span by moderators, however, if a child is brought to a condo by another player, or happens to find one by chance, their innocence will be tainted. Condos feature sex rooms with morphs that make you look like you are naked with over-exaggerated bits and parts, and animations that include but are not limited to, thrusting, twerking, and BJs. There are also people who know how to cheat the system in a game to transport you to a room only to show a rape animation.
There's also the game called the streets where you can knock people out with knives, guns, and fists, and then stomp on them to kill them off.
Only way you can get the in game currency ""Robux"" is if you buy it.
Now, there are plenty of good games for kids to play. What I would suggest is to moderate your child while they play Roblox. Check in every 10 minutes just to see what's going on, or peak over their shoulder from another room. If you have a child under the age of 14, I advise you don't let them use a computer, laptop, or ipad in their room if they are going to play Roblox. If they argue about using the ipad in their room, take it away and tell them they can only use a pc/laptop/computer when playing Roblox.
Heed my warnings parents. Keep your children's innocence safe.","Adult"
"age 12+","It depends. Roblox is a site where anyone can create, really, anything. For example there is 'pet simulater', a harmless game where you collect litter and throw it in a bin to collect money to buy pets. But then there are games like 'murder mystery' or 'slenderman' which are horror games. I personally (becuase this is the kid writing at the moment, not the parent, but don't worry, I was allowed) like the game a lot. Some of the games are really fun and it's great to play with your friends, as it's multi-player. But then, at the same time there are those people that cyber-bully that call you stupid, swear, say offensive things about religion and race, even if Roblox tries its best to hashtag out swearwords and possibly offensive words. If u search up a bad/innapropriate word in the 'search games' area, likely hood is something bad will come up... thanks for reading if you came this far!","Adult"
"age 13+","Roblox is a simple child-friendly game. Now, the reason I said it should be for kids 13 and up is just for safety. There are predators and exploiters everywhere. BUT this is a good game one of the problems being the bot-ed games and chat filters but the filters work to some degree I suppose. I enjoy this game and its simplicity.","Adult"
"age 8+","I have been playing actively since I made my account in 2012. I have what I assume to be around 10,000 hours playing all kinds of different games over the last 7 years.
I will start with the positives. Roblox allows players imaginations to soar with creativity, within their terms of service (TOS) of course. The community, at least the majority is friendly. Most people are there to have fun, and can be quite enjoyable to play with. The diverse amount of games on Roblox is very impressive, some of which are also educational. Some games do involve violence, but they are mostly just cartoons that are no different from a kids TV show. There is however, a few more violent games that would be recommended for a PG13+ rating. From my experience, there are no games on roblox that would even warrant higher than a PG13+, and if there is they are most likely breaking TOS and will be taken down after Roblox does a review of it. Roblox has a neat review system. What they do is they will take something down, whether a game or decal, etc and put it in the ""review state"". This means regular users can't see what that item was, and if it is a game they won't be able to play it and will be presented with a message that says ""This place is currently undergoing review"" or something to that effect. If it is deemed to be breaking TOS, they will remove it and depending on what it broke, the creator will either be warned, temporarily banned or in some cases, straight up have their account deleted.
Roblox's moderation team is very quick to react and punish anything or one that breaks their TOS. The reporting system roblox has in place allows a user to report a player that could be either scamming, bullying/harassing or breaking many other different rules. Some players claim this doesn't work, but I can tell you from experience it very much does work.
Now, for the neutrals. Roblox has heavily consumerism, however none of this is actually required to play roblox. The purpose of this system is mainly cosmetic, but some game developers (other players) can set-up game-passes (like small bonuses) for their games to support themselves in the making of that game, and a few even use it by making their game cost a small amount as protection against exploiters/hackers, making those games have a small cost. Roblox has pretty fair prices I'd say, at least compared to other games similar to Roblox, though still a bit of a reach for a lot of people.
Negatives, the main reason I wanted to write this review. Roblox's censorship system, is the worst joke I have ever seen. It censors many words, including the vast majority of swear words and the like, yet they can't get them all as new ones are created all the time. However, that is not the negative part, in-fact they do a good job with the swearing. The issue is Roblox appears to use a Contextual Based Algorithm that will work out anything else that should be censored that may be deemed offensive or inappropriate. This Algorithm though gets it wrong majority of the time, and will censor a lot of simple everyday words and sayings, e.g. ""As well"", ""DC"", ""Disc"", ""Name"", etc. This may not seem like a big deal, but this system causes a lot of frustration, as you often have to work around it to have a simple conversation about say what level you are in a RPG on roblox, or if you say do something ""as well"" as someone else. Some players have also got such a handle on how this system works out the context, that it even allows them to bypass it and say highly sexual stuff. Though this is also a rare occurrence, and is usually done by older players.
Continuing with the negatives, a very minuscule part of the community is toxic, nothing you can do about that unfortunately. Thanks to a lot of media attention on it, a lot of kids think it is cool to be a ""troll"". In terms of roblox, this means they either purposely break the TOS or walk along the line. This does include uploading forbidden content, that is sexual or predatory in nature. Thankfully, Roblox is very, very fast at discovering this content, and pulling it down. However, that doesn't mean other kids hadn't seen it during that time.","Adult"
"age 5+","I think its great for kids! The chat filter is great if your account is under 13 there is no swearing. I think its great all of you other people are WRONG!! It helps my child react to things quick! It also helps him talk to people 5 STARS only normies would give it a 1.... pathetic","Adult"

"age 18+","Me and my son were looking at this game, he tried it and while I watched him join somebody started saying: ""########"" repeatedly! I grabbed the console and went straight to here, lots of swearing, and violence with swords.","Adult"
"age 7+","Well, my daughter had played this game for three years. I've seen the chat, and its usually not good. The game introduces some bad things that kids should not know about. Like sex, drugs, abuse, harassment, and more! I recommend children 8 and under (The young ones) should be restricted from using the chat at all. (Yes, you can disable chat) plus, when your making your child a account, I recommend entering their actual date of birth to enable parental controls. That means the child cannot use certain features of the site, like the chat. The only reason I faked my nine year old's birth is because she was mature enough (She already knew about adult themes) and was trusted not to use that language outside of the website. (My daughter started at 6 years old). Only if your child is responsible enough, you should give them the chat. CHILD'S MESSAGE: The game's chat has a filter, but people bypass it usually. Take the word: Crap. People would use: ''Oh cra*!'' Now take real live stuff, like abuse. Some examples are: ''You stupid idiot. I bet your a 4 year old watching Peppa Pig.'' Also, that also counts as bullying. I've encountered teens who would bully me and make fun of me, they would usually harass me on a kids site. Really? Parents, I recommend that little kids should stay clear of the website!","Parent of a 9-year-old"
"age 9+","First of all, why would you say nobody should play it? Clearly your children are Online Daters, we people and my son has been trolling them, for ages. They could be AFK or the player spawned in, some games mods are bad. Roblox IS A POWERING IMAGINATION NOT SOME DIRTY IMAGINATION. You parents actually stupid to think that people write addresses but tags it out. Clearly you see that my son and have playing it and begin playing some games. There’s a game section, Roblox Mods can’t take reports unless you give them proof or they will send the report to the group who made it. I played myself, to be honest the game is fine. AND TO ALL FREAKISH ENTITLED PARENTS WHO WANTS ROBLOX BANNED LOOK AT THE ROBLOX YOUTUBERS, CLEAR SENSE IN YOUR HEAD.","Adult"

All went well until some of her friends started playing the ""horror"" genre survival games culminating with Peppa Pig (brandishing a large, bloodied knife and squealing with malice). I've now removed the game completely.
Although there is one option to filter content this then turns the messaging part off making the app useless.
It needs much better moderation, far more granular filtering and the ability to remove games that are inappropriate.
In short don't bother until they sort it out.","Adult"

You came create things called 'Groups' they can be mini businesses or just groups of friends. I find that my son has learnt lots of new spellings, grammar, and punctuation via the chat feature.
All the bad reviews are wrong, Roblox is a very safe game for children. I recommend Roblox for any parent with a child aged 9+

"age 13+","I have been playing this game for a bit over 6 years now, I just think over protective parents are giving this game a bad rep. This is the real world there is cussing violence and people saying or doing inappropriate things everywhere you go, it’s not realistic to expect “Roblox” which is a online platform where billions of users worldwide that go on here to not be inappropriate in some way. Don’t try to hold roblox responsible for things that may or may not happen on the platform, as a parent it’s your job to make sure your child is safe right so if your letting your child who’s not mature enough to handle the real world on a online platform then it’s your fault if something bad happens. Ironically it’s your children who are the ones cussing and saying explicit things on roblox. Wake up this is the real world humans are vulgar creatures even children, stop acting like your living in a bubble. Nowhere is safe including the internet too","Adult"
"age 13+","CHAPTER 1: INTRO
Roblox is a... ...Platform? Engine? Whatever, but it's by ""Roblox Co."" in 2004. The community is a Dumpster Fire and a waste of time, the games are either Simulators ran by idiots trying to abuse the Ideology of Capitalism for profit en masse, and Jailbreak clones.
The Ads are abused by scammers and money-hungry children to get money. I would know, after all, I used to be a Developer, I guess. I knew how to make Models, yes, but I knew the fundamentals of an original game.
CHAPTER 2: Ouch.
When you actually search up ""con con con"" in Game search, there's a likely chance that you'll find a Condo game, AKA a Roblox Sex Game. Avoid these. Toxic children everywhere. These games also include Vaping/Smoking, which you have to be 21 to even do, at least, here in Illinois, and Swearing, which is why there's a FILTER. I get a kick, personally, on kinkshaming little kids. People can also ""Password Guess,"" or Compromise, an Account, which is against the rules.

the best game","Parent of a 2, 7, 13, and 16-year-old"
"age 13+","Hello, as I saw all the negative reviews on here I'd like to give my own opinion. I started playing ROBLOX when I was 8, back in 2009, and from there I was immediately hooked. I used to play it all the time with friends and family and found it to be very fun. Albeit at the time the website was just getting started, it was a good thing. At this time, there was no swear word filter, and no one really cared about cursing or saying bad things because there was a safechat feature, and things were fine. This website teaches you how to build and script and how to create awesome things, and gives you a variety of games to play. Yes, there is violence, but in no way will it make your kid anymore violent, It's literally just LEGOs fighting each other. If your child is encountering the recent wave of predators that have started to use Roblox, just block them. There is a feature where you can block someone and they can not speak to you or see what your doing ever again. If your child is playing roblox, be sure to monitor them regularly just in case this is happening. On Roblox, I met some people that I consider very good friends of mine that I have now met in real life, but I don't know how that is now because times have changed. Overall, Roblox has its flaws but the magic it once to us as a kid sadly isn't replicated nowadays due to its social media-esque redesign. However, this shouldn't discourage you from letting your kids play Roblox, because it's still a fun game for the younger audience.","Adult"
"age 8+","Okay, first of all the catalog is extremely too expensive! I began playing when I was 8 years old because I found out about this game in 2008 when they played this game; therefore, Roblox wasn't always this bad until they started removing tix and that made population fall, they think that they can replace tix with ""Premium"" that is only available to kids in the UK. This is 2019 it would be nice for a lot of the older hats to come back for 2 robux and the reason I say this is because the ""free"" items in the catalog make your avatar look terrible I am not going to sit here and lie. Also, I understand that removing Guests was apart of ""removing exploiters"" but you don't realize Guests are what made this game Roblox.. Speed chat for the younger players! Honestly I think everyone is ready to get rid of these tags your team tags everything that isn't bad, but I can understand you blocking out cursing I mean you should of done this back in 2015! 2015, was the year of destruction, exploiters, and sexist.. I hope everyone reads this because it has got down to the point kids can't have fun no more! Adding Rthro!? You just put the entire site into danger as I've seen other players use that to sexually harass, troll someone.. I've seen it happen! This game use to be for players 8+ but now that I have written my post it should at least be for 16+ Roblox has fallen a lot.. People still complain about your team trying to make roblox into a realistic game using meshes and other dumb stuff.. ROBLOX WAS FOUNDED TO BE A COPY OF LEGOS! NOT MESHES, OR RTHRO YOU GET RID OF THE BLOCKY PACKAGES YOU WILL LOOSE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THIS IS HEADING!","Adult"
"age 7+","So don’t worry don’t delete the app if you see a scammer just block and report the scammers. Overall I would say this is a good app! I think this this mostly suits 7 and up. also you can sometimes cheat to swear but I hate it how the monitors monitor numbers like is you say one or 1 it will look like ### or #. Also be careful of hackers kids!! Also I know your sick of me now I promise this is the last thing. You may think this is to violent but I don’t. So whenever your characters blows off, jumps into lava,falls from a high place in some games,or just die your character will say OOF!","Adult"
"age 2+","my childs account got banned for nothing, the moderation of roblox is really bad, they sayed: Your account has been deleted for creating, promoting, or participating in inappropriate behavior or content. This is a violation of our Terms of Use. hes 12 years old and didnt do this, roblox says : your account got banned correctly","Adult"
"age 8+","I read some of the reviews. They are fake, These are just parents who didnt teach they're kids enough in online safety. And even kids pretending to be adults becuase they are mad they couldnt get robux or they got scammed or something around those lines. And i am going to address most of what i read.
Violent Games- Games are not made by Roblox, They are made by players. Roblox does check the game to make sure it is safe. People in the Roblox community love these games, and they dont find an issue with it because not all kids are under 12, So they have those kind of games for your mature child. If you have an issue you can go into your childs settings and simply block games that may be inappropriate for you child. It honestly is alot more cleaner then Fortnite.
Sex?- Okay so people say there is rap/sexual content. Its false. I have played almost every game on there possible with my daughter and son, And have seen nothing to prove this. If anything its a roleplay where yes, you can pretend to have boyfriend/girlfriend husband/wife roleplay, But Roblox monitors this to make sure it doesn't go PG-13. If they do try to kick things up a notch, it will get tagged. ( show up in ""#"" and wont be readable. ) And if they do manage to sneak some things into it, They will find there account suspended for up to 3 days.
Swearing- Yes i have seen some minor swearing. But let me remind you roblox allows certain words for the children that are 12 and up such as ""wth"" ""tf"" ""hell"". Anything else is not allowed. Some players try sneaking stuff in, But Roblox usually takes care of this.
Child preds- The wrongest thing on here. It is no where near true. Yes some people may ask for info, if they do say no and leave. Even report them if you feel its serious. Roblox cares about they're players and do they're best to protect our children, but its not all of Roblox's job to do that, Its ours too. So dont go talking about Roblox if anything has happened to your child. It is simply because you haven't educated them enough in online safety, And you didnt care to take a look at their screen every once in a while.
Bullying- Yes. Bullying is here. But if you take care of it properly you wont have an issue. You can block them, report them, or even leave the server. My son says if you play the right cards and stand up to them, you could make the player leave. This is the internet and even adults get bullied on social media, So if adults will do it, Im not surprised our kids are doing it. We cant get mad at Roblox or even any game out there for not protecting our children bullying is everywhere. All we can do is Report/Block the person and hope they're parents will find out about what they are doing.
Hacks/Scams- Yes there are players that are bots, But dont worry, they are not trying to steal your personal info, Its the account they are after. There are ways to fix this, simply report the player, spread the word around about the bots ( lots of kids on there are doing this and is warning others to be careful ). You can set up account safety, It has pins and stuff like that you can enable. I also seen some parents going way out on this hacking thing and saying they can hack into your computer/internet. Another false. Roblox is un-hackable. You cant even hack for robux that easy. Most videos out there saying they did are even fake. ( it says in the description it was made for entertainment purposes. ) So you dont have to worry about. :)
pop-ups- All you need is a adblocker, After this you will only get Roblox ads on the site, and those are safe and just advertise other Roblox games and groups and clothings. No nudes or sexual content are in any of those. Im not sure where parents get the whole ""nudes"" thing from this game. Only thing i can think of is the ads not by Roblox.
I do highly recommend this game for your children! It is fun and can even be educational. I love it and me and my kids have played for 4 years. A huge thumbs up to the game.","Adult"
"age 13+","I am in fact a teenager. Having played Roblox for, now, about five years, I can say that most of the games on the platform are totally fine, and there are very varied choices (from war roleplays, to restaurant tycoons, to hide and seek). Moderation leaves quite a bit to be desired, however it has vastly improved.
The only games I'd recommend that your child stay off are online-dating games (MeepCity being the most prominent example, as players often bypass the filter and have ""online sex"".) However, most people are perfectly normal on Roblox, and the ODers are the vocal minority...","Adult"
"age 6+","WARNING TO ALL CHILDREN!
There are a bunch of idiot parents attempting to take down roblox web
Roblox despite not good still takes care with its under 13 system!
I advise u not to read comments from overprotective parents!
Enable parental controls and ur child is safe!","Adult"
"age 18+","I saw him talking with strangers not only that but they were telling him to ""go away"" but what they meant is that he should go die. I let my son play games like gta5 that aren't violent. I think that Roblox should be restricted 18. my son was also asking for 100 dollars for ""Robux"" but he was probably online dating.","Adult"
"age 10+","Roblox couldn't get more kid friendly, it's almost as family friendly as Minecraft. This game is simply a paradise for kids, there are so many games that your child can spend their time on and so many new things to learn off of it, I probably would be a different person if I didn't play Roblox back in '7-'10.
I made this review primarily to address the rumours of ""Horrible"", ""Hostile"" and ""Excessively Sexual or Outright Sexual"" activities in Roblox.
Your child will not find these. I have found multiple sources from media sites addressing this as common occurrences but I, personally have never found a single activity like this.
In order to find a ""Pornographic"" game on Roblox (commonly referred to as RR34) you will need to go on the Disboard website, find a valid and not yet shutdown Discord (A text app for the Popular Culture community) server about an ""RR34"" game and go through a usually 7-8 step process of Verification and Age Confirmation to find a game. Not only are these games not allowed by any circumstances on Roblox and are usually deleted within 2-3 hours of them being uploaded but it is also a Misdemeanor to expose a child to pornography on a site that bans it; so you can rest safe knowing your children won't find a game like this.
Overall, Roblox has changed me for the better and I hope that future generations of children and content creators will keep the game alive and running smoothly.
As of now Roblox is available on Kindle Fire, Mobile, Xbox and Windows for purchase, so it shouldn't be a stress to get it.","Adult"
"age 8+","This app is very good for ur kids yes it is online so there can be privacy concerns but it is monitored very well when my kid asked to get it i let him and got it on my iPhone 8! However if u accidently buy something items can be a dollar 2 100 dollars","Adult"
"age 9+","If you read the other reviews it says “sexual stuff” and “language” don’t listen to them. You can turn chat off and there can’t be “sexual stuff” because ROBLOX will always review it before it is published. And if you don’t like the game pics. So let’s take murder mystery for instance it has a knife on the front. So what??!!! If it was inappropriate then ROBLOX would take it down and if the name was inappropriate then it would be called “content deleted” don’t worry kids love it and I give them happy memories.","Adult"
"age 9+","Its a fun game for kids to play but some things need to be watched out for. I have seen a wide variety of ages play this game. From a 6 year old to a 16 year old. Roblox blocks out all curse words and does not allow you to type numbers in order to prevent kids from sharing age phone number ect. People do find ways to get around that. Parents should keep an eye on their children when they are playing.","Adult"
"age 10+","There was an issue 3 months ago where another player called my daughter by her real name, Asked personal questions
and REFUSED to get out of her car (in the game.) My 9 yr old got scared. After hearing this, I was scared as well. We reached out to all possible players that could’ve known her real name. I called customer service, got the run around, they had ABSOLUTELY NO REGARD OR CONCERN about our fears. I was asked if they wanted me to have them call the “owner” in VERY SARCASTIC and OBNOXIOUS tone. I asked them to pull up the records of the interactions with my daughter on that specific date and time, to research and find the “culprit,” they refused.
THIS GAME IS BASICALLY, “PLAY AT YOUR OWN CHILD’S RISK,” game.
I will respond to the gentleman that attempted to refute other parents’ concerns after having the same type of issue and/or experience.
Just because you and/or your child DID NOT have a negative experience with ROBLOX, DOES NOT diminish or relinquish the fact that others have. I would hope that WE ALL RESPECT each other’s parenting abilities in trying to keep our children safe.","Adult"
"age 8+","roblox is the best","Adult"
"age 7+","Parents are overreacting over ROBLOX. Hackings are extremely rare, and when they do happen they aren't severe. In fact hackings on ROBLOX happen about as often as other games. The moderation system is effective, making sure things are kid-friendly BEFORE other players can see it. ROBLOX also has great educational content, allowing kids to easily build games and learn to code, through easy to understand tutorials. Although granted, there are some violent and upsetting these can be blocked through the options in settings. The only real problem is the consumerism, trying to get players to buy robux for higher prices than what its really worth.","Adult"
"age 9+","I’ve been playing roblox for a couple of years, around when I was 15-17. Here’s the bad part: When I play it, i’ve only once seen an inappropriate game. And it had around like, 2 players? So the only bad part is out of the way. Here’s the good part: The game has a good community if you treat them with respect. Sometimes they joke around and call you noobs and such, but that is solely based around your avatar. You can easily get a couple of free items to spruce up your avatar. Theres clothing, hats, hair, face accessories and shoulder accessories too! There are 2 things called robux and builders club. Those cost some money, obviously they’ll exist so they can keep the website running. The way to make an account is really simple too! When you make your account, there is a risk of getting hacked though. An easy way to avoid this is to activate 2-step-verification. All you need to do is add your email to your account, and go to your email, and roblox will have already sent you one. When you’re reading through it you’ll see the button to verify it. Once activated, anytime you or anyone else tries to enter your account, you’ll have to enter a code that roblox emails to you. So yeah. An easy way to secure your account. You can also make friends and followers. Followers first of all are people who aren’t on your friends list, but you can still see in your followers list. And there’s the friends list. Friends are people you can meet in-game, or by searching their names up. If you friend somebody, you can message them without being in the game with them, but there’s still safechat that blocks out all inappropriate messages and personal info. When you’re friends with someone, you can also join their game if their settings allow it. Have I also mentioned the settings? If you don’t want your kids talking to people in-game, you can easily not allow it in the settings! You can also not allow them to talk to people on the app/website. So overall, you should download this game. It has hundreds of great games! (My personal pick is work at a pizza place.) thanks for reading this review. Have a good one!","Adult"

"age 16+","I am a father of 3 and 2 of mine are still at home. My son and daughter brought Roblox to my attention 2yrs ago. I began playing multiple games with them. I really do like how they have created a site for anyone to participate game developing. This side is great. But Roblox has been built off of it's safeness for children. From filters to parental controls, but who protects these children from Roblox themselves? I have played over 100 games on this site with my children as well as bored times by myself. From games , to limited item trades, to working on our own games, and clothing. Now is where I tell you the truth behind Roblox. This is a Very bad site to involve any money or allow your child to have any access to limited items. This is the dark side of Roblox. Accounts are continuously being hacked for limited items. This is not children, grown people who figured out your child is easy prey. Noone knows whos behind the keyboards. On top of this Roblox as a company is very horrible and their customer service is the worst I've ever encountered. They will blaime everyone but themselves when something goes wrong with Robux. They are very determined that it's someone elses fault. Ex. 1) My son spent 1396 robux on a game called Warrior Simulator. Well come to find out these game passes don't exist but it sure will take the money. I followed the rules of their guidelines, I contacted the Developer of this game via Twitter. Now I find out this Developer of this said game has had their account terminated and can't get on the game he created to fix these issues. So I contact roblox back via their support and I receive a bunch of remarks of how Roblox has nothing to do with this or the money or the game. So if they have no part in this why did you terminate the player/Developer? That s not my business is what I am told, but yet they tell me repeatedly that this is who I need to contact to refund my sons robux , but only way to refund is for this said person to send a trade and my son gives them a limited item and they can add the robux into the trade, (in which case Roblox will take 30 percent of the transaction). Shew seems like a lot of problem and Roblox certainly wants their cut for them to not be involved in this matter.Needless to say ,days are passed developer is still terminated and my son is still sitting here looking at me to help him fix this, for I am his DADDY. I seen a comment from another parent who claims is a small percent, don't I repeat to all parents, do not believe this individual. There s many teenagers on here taking advantage of the smaller children. Cyber Bulling Is a major problem on this gaming platform. Roblox will do nothing about any problems unless it has to do with what players call traders (limited items) get caught selling items off of other websites. this is not a small amount of players eighter. Take a gander at your browser Roblox Buy Limiteds Cheap, several sites come up with numerous players selling items via paypal, but again you pay them and then up to them to give you this item in a trade. They have free robux websites posting contiuosly throughout games and links to these said games that give free robux. These are all scam sites right there on roblox being used to hack your childs accounts. You tube links and so much more. So it boils down to is this a safe website, NO it is NOT. No child should have to endure a lot of the bulling going on this site. I have allowed my children to play this site and spend money(a lot of money). They aren't the kids whom get bullied for being a Noob (kids whom have nothing on the game item wise) . I do spoil them for I like to play games myself and you pay to play if you want full experience of games. I am old but I know gaming is expensive. My children now only play on Xbox. I have locked them out of Roblox due to the nature of what another said of pornography hacks, this is true I have seen this several times as well as very rude and disrespectful messages on clothing made by players. From one parent to another, this should be a 16+ rated website. Roblox is taking major advantage of children to earn a buck. They take 30percent of any and everything and if no Builders Club 90percent. 100million users a month is also a lie, theres 100 of thousands of double accounts as well as bot accounts for hacking , stealing, and exploiting you and your children. I'm sure with these large amounts of money being transferred that Roblox Interns And Their staff have their greedy little hands in the limited scams as well. It's always about the money for companies or there'd be no company, but ROBLOX is showing a very fortune 500 company adittude towards it's players, supporters, as well as PARENTS. (fortune 500 company, make the dollar by any means necessary no matter whom it hurts or who losses as long as its not them, then bankrupt when the truth and the heat is on them for their scandals.) There really is no nice way to put it. ROBLOX is not safe for under age children, nor your credit card. And game cards , yeah problems there as well, the have nothing to do with game cards eighter. I f you buy a game card at a store goto roblox website and redeem it and anything goes wrong, good chance %99.9, you will just lose your money cause ROBLOX claims no responsibility to its own currency, EVER. To top it off they aren't even a credit company by the BBB. That says a lot about a company to me.","Adult"

"age 10+","Hello fellow parents, If you want to let you're kids play ROBLOX. You should! Why? Well I'm gonna mention the good and bad things about ROBLOX Good things: 1. You're kid can connect with people with all ages around the world. 2. ROBLOX has millions and maybe even billions of games that you're kid can play and have fun for hours! 3. You're kid can create and design there character. 4. You're kid can learn to draw or make art by joining groups about art! Or they can socialize or roleplay with other players by roleplaying like a Doctor Or a soldier. 5. They can learn to make games and code! Which they can use in real life situations! And heres what ROBLOX more explained _ What is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.","Adult"
"age 8+","Personally I think ROBLOX is a good game. But people need to understand that ROBLOX can't always control what other people do. And if you don't want your child to communicate then you can go to chat settings.and for those parents who complain about ROBLOX asking for there childs age they do that so they can limit what they say. So if you are under 13 you can't say certain things (You can't swear even if you are over 13 though). One thing I think parents should do though is supervise there child when they make a roblox account to make sure they put there proper age.On ROBLOX you can also block users which means that they can't contact you on ROBLOX. You can also adjust who can talk them in game. ROBLOX also has creator challenges that supports lots of imagination.","Adult"

"age 18+","Literally a pedophile feast, posing as kids to lure your children in as far as they can and possibly offline. All the reviews are sadly true, I've witnessed all of it with my own daughter. The porn is brought into games by users who hack the servers, it's everywhere and bad, you cannot erase those images out of your child's mind. What's done is done. The creeps literally groom your children, until they get the child's trust. I had to intervene when noticing something seriously wrong with my daughter, I began to watch and removed her immediately from the website. Apparently there is no protection for children online in this aspect, people shrug and move on. The children are literally the consumer here.","Adult"

So long story short this game would be fine if it wasn’t for the creepy adults on the game.

"age 13+","I got my 10-year-old ROBLOX about a couple of years ago. It seemed okay until I checked out some games. There was this one game named ''Meepcity''... I thought it was a normal game until the game had loaded. It was suppose to be a kid-friendly game from customizing your house and ''role playing'' with your pet ''Meep''. Though it is jammed packed with Oders. (Online daters.) What I mean by this is, that you will see people with ''fat legs'', tattoos , and most of all inappropriate clothing. I also noticed some people had sex on beds and just in general which bypassed the ROBLOX filter and this stuff broke the terms of service. Some people started swearing as well they started saying words like ''Bitch'' and ''Fuck'' and words related to that. This could possibly get your children cat fished into thinking it was a person the same age as them and to meet them in real life.
There are also some games that has violence, such as gun games, murder, and much much more. This could really courage your children to do bad stuff. There could be great messages but there could be bad messages, especially following, swearing, bullying, and more.
Most videos are located on ROBLOX, I checked a few and it made me realize that ROBLOX only wants money, as they gain millions of dollars from people buying their stuff from the catalog. They don't ban ODER's unless their really really bad. This could be very bad for your children as imagining your child talking to a 60 year old man. This 60 year old person in real life, wanting to meet your child and kill them or at least take them away.
Moderators don't do anything as well, the report system doesn't work at all. Your account can also get scammed and taken away by hackers.. buying robux will be a risk of loosing all of your money on a pixelated game.
I personally don't think your child should play this game unless a parent is watching them, or you think that they are mature enough to play handle these types of things.","Adult"
"age 7+","My daughter age 11 loves this game. Problem is hackers constantly stealing all her stuff. She had about 8-9 game charactors, all stolen. Got gift cards, real money, most of that stolen before she could use it. I have emailed the company repeatedly no answers. It's a cool game but sadly throws kids into a tailspin when they watch their items disappear before their eyes. It is really just a game for hackers. Shame on Roblox, but as we know these company's only care about the $$$.","Adult"
"age 15+","I found that my step daughter was finding grown men on this game to send naked pictures of herself to, she was telling these men she was 20 most told her they were 18-25. They can essentially have “sex” in the game using words and getting their characters naked. There’s also the danger of kids giving them other ways of contacting them for pictures.","Adult"
"age 12+","I have children of 2 who love playing Roblox. They may play up until 6 PM. One time, I decided to play Roblox. I made an account and entered. Once I was in this game called JailBreak I was approached by a male. He sent me a friend request, and I accepted. Later, he asked me for my email, and password. Thus, I unfriended him. Once I left this game, I went on to play another game called phantom forces. In this game players are suppose to kill each others, with realistic guns.

I am appalled that a company that makes MILLIONS of dollars on parents money refuses to properly moderate the chats in these games. I would like to launch a class action lawsuit against ROBLOX. The horrific stuff my kids have been subjected to is disgusting. I wrote a letter to ROBLOX and my daughter took screenshots thankfully but she’s greatly traumatized by this. The predators not only used vulgar sexual talk with my child but even threatened to come and kidnap her. She’s genuinely traumatized and scared. I’m beyond furious that this company that upon researching is not only notorious for ripping parents off (I’ve had it happen too) but worse, they KNOW predators are talking and trying to bait kids and they have done absolutely NOTHING to stop it, they could easily pay a few dollars an hour to moderate each and every game they offer. It’s a responsibility they have shirked willfully causing damage to these kids.
For us, no more ROBLOX. It’s forbidden in our house and should be banned in my opinion. They won’t do anything but they happily cash in on the kids they’re only too happy to expose.","Adult"

"age 13+","My 9 year old daughter first started playing this over a year ago. At first I had no concerns. I made sure that the privacy and security settings were correct and it was linked to my email etc. She mainly used Meep City and Royale High. However, recently my daughter has told me of quite a few things that I find concerning. The main thing is users who go on looking for relationships, they are called Oders. They actively pursue others in a game and can then try to suggest things like kissing, or more like suggesting lying on top of someone. Swear words can't appear but one 'party room' in meep city had 'bitch' written in fairy lights What was more worrying though was a 'locked' room that you had to be invited in to. This room was called 'the dirty talking' room and was being controlled by the user who created the party. I feel that there are now so many different games on Roblox that there is no way the owners/programmers can keep an eye on all content. I am good with technology and keep an eye on my daughter's internet usage but even then, she has encountered troubling behavior on this game. And just googling roblox brings up even scarier stories. I think these games she should be played with chatting in game and private chats off and with a parent sitting beside them. Although I have taken the decision to block the game on all devices. I do not think young children should play this game at all.","Adult"
"age 16+","Roblox isn't for all ages at all, it is very easy to get in touch with all kinds of people. Whilst my kid and I were having breakfast he told me he was asked to give his personal information, otherwise they would hack his computer.
Immediately I uninstalled Roblox afterwards.","Adult"
"age 9+","There's chat filters and some good games, but don't expect everyone to be nice on the internet. As an adult I like this game very much, but there's some games with animated deaths and things so if your kid can't do those than make sure he/she stays away from those games. You can make your own games here which is cool as well. Make sure you don't get scammed by people however.","Adult"
"age 6+","I found this site (Commonsensemedia) while looking for information on other online games. I wanted to see what others were saying about Roblox to give me a ""standard"" to know how reliable/accurate the reviews were here. So I started reading the reviews for Roblox. Which is why I'm writing this review. I hope others will learn from is.
Let me tell you the reason I let my 5 (now almost 7) year old play Roblox.
Pros:
Reason #1. It's the ultimate tool for discipline. I can lock him out of his account if he doesn't do his homework, chores, etc. It's painless and every effective.
Reason #2. Folks life is hard and dangerous. It's better that our children learn these lessons virtually in an online game than in the real world where it can cause real pain and hardship. On Roblox my son has learned:
a) Not all who ""friend"" you are your friends. You need to have a common sense approach to who you trust and who you don't. He's had some of his items ""stolen"" buy other players. He's been bullied and he's been cheated. These are all good lessons to learn now. He's far more careful about who he deals with in real life.
b) There are scammers everywhere. He knows that you don't get something for nothing and that anyone promising you something for free is probably trying to trick you.
c) He has learned there are bad peole in the world and he has learned you REPORT those people! He has learned to report directly via the Roblox systme and he's learned to tell mom or dad what is going on. He has learned ""stranger danger"" isn't just something you hear but it's real.
d) He has learned about hacking and that hacking is cheating and cheating is bad. He's learned that people will cheat to get ahead. This is a good thing.
e) It teaches cooperation. It teaches the work ethic. In every game we have played in order to get the ""good stuff"" you have to work hard.You have to do your quests to get the rewards We play together at least once a week and he learned he has some skills better than others. So you develope those skills. So many times I have used examples from the game in real life to illustrate things. For example, I'll say ""remember that guy who tricked you into giving him one of our pets by pretending to be your friend"" well people do that in the real world. And he gets it right away. I don't have to explain it any further than that.
In summary he has learned from the ""school of hard knocks"" and he's far more mature about things now.
Reason #3. It's fun.
Cons:
Now with that said here are the real dangers of Roblox: It can be addictive, so set a schedule. He can only play after all homework is done. He can only play for more than an hour on weekeneds and on weekends it's only play for X hours and the do something else for X hours. So that he has a balance. He gets this.
Another danger is money. It's very easy to spend money. Now they are not as bad as other games, you can play A LOT without spending a dime, but eventually your child will want Robux (the game currency) to buy something in the games. And this is another lesson: You want Robux, earn them. I give him 100 Robux ($1 real money) for every A he gets, 25 ($0.25) Robux for every B and nothing for C and below. I give him extra chores to earn Robux. Vacuum the house for $25 Robux. He learns if you want money you have to work for it.
Most games also have a leaderboard. You want to be on the leaderboard you'll have to dedicate yourself to achieving that goal.
To so many reviewers who complain about bullying on Roblox.... think about it, your kid has to learn how to handle these people and doing it virtually is better than what I had to endure when I was a kid (constantly beat up in real life when I was his age.)
Another danger: porn. I have been in a game where someone learned how to skin with porn images (a ""skin"" is basically the images for your cloths.) Some were very graphic (child porn.) I reported them to Roblox and the FBI (child porn) but did not hear back from either however, I have not seen it return. While this is a real porm, the image quality is usually pretty low resolution. So while I recognized what the image was my son did not. So the risk is possible but low.","Adult"
"age 13+","Roblox has flaws such as trying to solve a problem by removing stuff but, the real problem is the community. Roblox's community is filled with trolls, Oders (Online Daters), exploiters, and haters. First of all, you should make sure your child is being monitor by you (The Parent/Guardian) , its not Roblox's duty to babysit your child. Second, please teach your child about online safety and the bad things that could happen. Last, please go over the Roblox Community guidelines and terms of service with them and tell them to report any bad things other players do, it can help lot. Now its time to talk about Roblox's fault. Roblox dose nothing to solve the problem of rule-breaking in the game. They had the same chat filter (with some bad updates) since the beginning and it has proven to not be effective, alot of people managed to bypass the filter by changing a few letters in words like F*** to Fuxk and like Sex to Sux or Six. Roblox tried to fix this problem by making the chat filter even more strict by censoring innocent words and numbers, all this just gave even more criticism that Roblox just ignored. Finally, please watch these videos because im tired typing so much

"age 6+","Ok so Ive read quite a few comments on stuff like ""oh this game is rlly inappropriate for kids and has a lot of ""violent"" and ""sexual"" games.... Ive been playing for over 4 years and guess what??? I dont really understand what you mean by ""too violent"" just because they use guns or knives.... there are much worse games your kid can be playing other than roblox and if you don't want your kid exposed to this kinda stuff then just keep him off the internet for the rest of his/her life cause the Internets full of this stuff. I mean are u gonna babysit ur kid for the rest of his life so that he never gets exposed to the word penetrate? And keep him off any games with guns for fear hes gonna rob a bank when hes older?? Stop over reacting and let your kid have some fun in his/her life instead of dulling it down to number games and math questions","Adult"
"age 6+","I heard everyone was saying ROBLOX has a bad influence, but when I saw my son play it, I went to look at it myself. I saw that ROBLOX is a very nice game, and it is safe. All those other bad reviews are false, you should really let your child play it.","Adult"

"age 10+","I’m going to be honest I lied about my age so parents could see this but honestly I have been playing roblox for 4 years now and I have seen 3 innapopriate things on all my time all of them being hackers and that’s it. You see unlike every other review on here it’s really not the way it sounds like they say it’s filled with innapropraite content but It’s all about the games you play if you know what games to avoid I promise you you will never see a single innapropriate thing on this sight. I play a lot of role play game and there are certain ones which are filled with online daters but they are quite easy to spot out games like meep city and adopt and raise a cute kid but except from that there is nothing. All the reviews here with people saying players have asked them to do sexual things with them in game is a lie how are they going to get across like that? We’re talking About a game if you say any number it gets tagged the filter system is stronger then any sight or game I have seen before. And if they find a child predator just teach them internet safety tell them not to add random people on discord and if your child is under 10 and doesn’t know much about internet safety if you go into settings and then privacy you can make it so you can’t communicate with other players. I’m going to be honest the worst part of this game is that it’s full of micro transactions everywhere but it may help your child learn things like saving money and not spend all of it at once. I haven’t even touched studio which is an entire new game essentially. Roblox is more of a development platform then a game and you can make games with it but it is hard. It can teach your kids how to script or how to make textures models meshes etc in games. But yeah the game is very enjoyable I recommend teaching them a thing about internet safety but I’ve easily got more then 3k hours on this game you can trust me when I say that I’ve been playing at least 2 hours a day for 4 years but don’t let them play it to much because they will get addicted and constantly ask you for robux and then it could resort to things like them stealing you credit card. That last part might sound stupid but it has happened many times before.","Adult"
"age 12+","I let my 12 year old play Roblox, And he was playing a game called bloxburg. He found that someone in the game spray painted.
And it was about Porn. Even worse it wasn't even pix elated.
I do not recommend Roblox to parents that don't want there child exposed to early to Pron and Sex.","Adult"
"age 9+","First of all what is ROBLOX?ROBLOX is a videogame with lego characters that you desing on your own.
As of a lot of people reporting being banned for 'no reason' you were all banned for a reason,you cannot be banned for 5-7 days WITHOUT a reason if an error happens ROBLOX is yet to always apologize to its fellow players.
Next being scammed and suing ROBLOX for it.First of all it's NOT ROBLOX's fault your kid fell for a scam.ROBLOX cannot make sure there is NO scams at all,since there is now more then BILLION of users on its platform it's not its fault you have a kid that'll do anything for free robux.
Getting charges on debit card.This is pretty much impossible since ROBLOX does NOT save debit car/credit card information so it's most likely that someone got your credit/debit card information and is using it to buy robux.So stop blaming ROBLOX for this.
Now onto some things everybody's talking about and hating on ROBLOX for it (EVEN THO IT'S MAKING NO SENSE)
-removal of tixs
what can I say?Tixs were free to get,as ROBLOX is a company that needs money to countinue its work it was a big bump in the face since they got NO money to keep the game going.
-Having to PAY for robux
As I said ROBLOX is a company and it needs money to keep running.You do NOT need robux to customize your character there is a bunch of free items in catalog that you can use.
-'bullying'
They say calling someone a 'noob' is bullying noob means new player/you just started and it's in no meaning harmfull.Calling someone out for not having robux IS bullying but let's be honest..how many people do that?Not so many when you think about it.
-violents and/or brain damage
""OH NO GUYS A LEGO FIGURE JUST FELL INTO PIECES I NOW HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE HELP!!""Is what these parents say.It's a lego figure..a lego figure how can that brain damage you?It's like you built something of legos and it fell on the ground and got into pieces and it brain damages you..
-reports are FAKE
First of all no reports are NOT fake.They say this since ROBLOX with its MORE THEN BILLION users cannot ban every single one with 3 reports.How many people do you think there is in moderation team?Yes it can be big,but not all of them are working on reports some of them have to see every item that is trying to be uploaded on site some have to check on game reports.Do you realize how much work it is?Now you do,it can take up to HOURS if not DAYS to do just one of these things to all ALREADY existing ROBLOX items.
-ODing/Online Dating
Online Dating is a problem on ROBLOX but let's face it never got so far it got into real life and most of the time it's hugging or holding hands or in EXTREMELY rare times it's kissing.Is this really that much of a problem?Having in mind that it never got very far.(yes I do know some times it did got far but it was a few times)
Well I'm guessing this is it,thanks for reading and bye!","Adult"
"age 9+","There are other reviews and events opposite from this one.
My son and I found a ROBLOX ad near mid 2014. We played the game together and it was so fun to play with my son. To this day, we occasionally play ROBLOX together and we still have the fond memories as we used to.
Yes, I understand. There are incidents with sexual contact etc, but you can’t blame ROBLOX for it’s not their fault. It’s also not the developers fault either. This can happen on a rare occasion when it does happen, you should report the player and email ROBLOX. You should also monitor your kids.
I also strongly encourage you to be connected and play with your child. Trust me, it’s amazing to play with my child.","Parent of a 11-year-old"
"age 5+","this game is the best everybody must install it and its also safe but there is something bad my kid asked for my credit card fo 24k robux and 3 months OBC and i told him to buy him 800 robux only and he said ok and in my opinion thats good for him because he probably said in his opinion why not and my opinion about this game is that this game is the best","Adult"
"age 8+","Although Roblox's global platform that brings childen together through play. It can leave children very sad when parents purchase Robux and other gamers steal their Robux. It is very expensive to buy Robux and when they are stolen, customer support acts like you are the criminal. Very disappointing.","Adult"
"age 2+","Thanks for reviewing. This makes our site grow continuously.","Adult"
"age 6+","you need to supervise your child depending on age because if you never watched you children online dating won't exist and because parents dont watch the children online dating exist. one review i saw said it had something to do with drugs!?!?! are you out of your mind was it roleplay like what. ok parents let me teach you why you should let your kids play, one reason is because its educational like lets have a school related game as an example, and someone the age of 19 takes roleplay too far and acts like an actual teacher that would be educational. there is a popular game right now called mad city which is about prison so if youre too scared about what your child will start thinking of then dont let them play. if someone calls your child a noob then that doesnt mean its a bad word the word noob means new. now back to roleplay it makes your child more social and make more friends. if your child ask you to buy robux then ask them before declining or accepting. if your child is getting bullied then just report the bully (by presing the esc key clicking a flag next to the bullies name then tell what the bully did) . so thats why you sould let a six year old play it. as a fact i know you can watch youtube and see how people play so that you can prevent your child from playing violent games. if you think that your child can come across a horror movie character then just say pictures like that dont exist because before the picture is published to roblox the picture is always sent to someone to see if its apropriate for the website if the picture is inapropriate then it means the person will its sent to will decline bringing it to roblox the sending method works also for clothes hats and other thngs people can put on the website. so just let you kid play roblox but watch what yourkid does","Adult"
"age 7+","I love Roblox and have been playing it since I was 6 or 7. It is easy to get hacked but a way to avoid this is to turn on 2-step verification. Also there is a chat filter but sometimes people can get away with saying something that is like a bad word but not exactly. But I mean parents cuss around kids a lot (at least in my experience) so it should not be of too mush concern.","Adult"

"age 18+","I have played this for a few weeks just to relax and let go of some stress. I can tell you everyday I have played I have been bullied or harassed by someone for items or robux! I as a new player cannot even get 5 minutes into the game before I am killed or bullied! These games are not safe for kids to be in if they are treated the same as I am being treated and I am an adult! I do not recommend it to kids!","Adult"
"age 18+","They have stolen money from my account on numerous occasions then cancel the entire account when it's disputed. MOREOVER I bought a roblox game card.

"age 6+","I have a 12 year old son and a 6 year old daughter. They love roblox my son has played roblox for maybe 5 years now and he loves it so I decided to take a look for myself. I made an account and played it with my kids! I did see some inappropriate things such as game pictures but within the next few months the games were deleted the moderators do a very good job! I emailed the moderators about an abusive player typing curse words in other languages they got back with me in less than 24 hours and banned his/her account. I put restrictions on my 6 year olds account. I did realize that they were playing roblox quite a lot so I did this thing where my son does 10 push ups per 15 minutes and he did it. I have never seen anything sexual in this game and it has great messages the moderators block out abusive words very well. There was this game my son liked called Pokémon brick bronze that was fun it was full of puzzles and mazes which I likes him playing more than shooting sombody. My son does like to buy stuff but I make him earn his money and he normally buys maybe 10 - 20$ worth of “robux”. And one time he bought 5$ worth of robux and he bought his little sister a horse in her favorite game which I believe was called shard seekers. Overall a very good game!","Adult"
"age 18+","Hi there, My daughter used to play Roblox all the time. I recently came to notice that she wanted to have some ""Robux"" because other people had it and she thought that she was getting left out. I as a parent said no and I decided to check out the game myself. Right when I made an account, I was bombarded with games showing very inappropriate content. I joined one of them and all the other players kept calling me ""NOOB, NOOB"" and said that they called me this because I didn't have ""Robux"". After this experience, I tried to contact the administrators but they said that there was nothing they could do. Now I will never let my daughter play this game again. I also recommend you to keep your children away.","Adult"

"age 6+","Roblox has many good things.Example the scripting that help children to create places and more stuff that maybe it will help them in the futere.Roblox has a bad a side about the online dating and it's an biog issue for children because they are talking dirty.I'm playing roblox over 6 years and I am very proud about Roblox for what have they done.Also I want to mention about the ""violence"" anout many parents talk about but it's not because it's poor.","Adult"
"age 18+","This game website has a lot of killing games like a game where kids stab each other and get money so they can get upgrade their knife,a youtuber that makes videos showed off that game and this game website has a lot of bullies that like to harass people, even more low key games are bad, in meep world kids have houses and adult parties and try to date and they can adopt on some of these games and marry too and and other terrible games that are not fit for children. the game allows you to report someone if they are swearing or being a bully but it does nothing,they don't get kick off the minute you report them even if you do it more than once and roblox will not protect your child either. this game is a waste of time, money, and life. Life should be more precious than exposing yourself to bad games,being harassed, dirtiness and bad examples. And a bully doesn't have to swear all they have do is say hateful things to you and then you will feel awful and terrible and roblox won't do anything to punish the bully. its best to go else where if you want to have clean fun and feeling happy without a bully to harass you. there is plenty of others games that are super fun. roblox is not one of them.","Adult"
"age 10+","I think this game is amazing there is so much you can do and many varieties you can choose from. The game has a okay sense of moderation such as boundaries ingame such as not being able to use any items 13+ stuff like that. There is almost never any 18+ content and will remain that way for a long time. The game is only including 18+ exploiters and it isn't in your hands just to report it. They have a bad system that needs to be fixed such as random bans after reporting someone. Customer service is great! I got my brother's code back after he accidentally scratched it of, The best way to report someone is to just block them and report them ingame I have been playing for 6 years now and the game has made great changes and bad changes. The game is now also going corporate sadly. It all started when tix was removed. Tix was an old currency that could be obtained everyday simplify racking up everyday. You could buy stuff for free but the game made the Decision to go coporate and not listen to the community. The game still has events though! if you work hard you can rack up alot of free eggs! the game has it's up and downs but most games inside of ROBLOX have no exploiters and it could make the community better to fight against people doing this online and the game will be stronger!","Adult"

"age 18+","My 10 year old daughter was playing this game yesterday and I didn't know about it. She had downloaded it at some point and kept it from me. So I went on her ipad when she went to sleep yesterday and you wouldn't believe what I found. In her recent she had played games called Adopt and raise a kid, Roblox highschool and some other pg minigames. I went into one and it was horrible. These other lego men and women were playing ear blasting music. There were shirtless men, and young ladies with bulky legs. The lego I was also had the same bulky legs. The clothing they were wearing was so disrespectful. Along with horrible actions and words. This game is definitely not suitable for kids. There was spam and I just had to leave. I wouldn't recommend playing this game without parent supervision.","Adult"
"age 7+","If you've seen Roblox before, this website is for kids. It is really nice game, but the moderation could use a tweak on their jobs. As you see, if you report a player it doesn't really work anymore which is a problem. I say, that the moderation is too busy because imagine about I billion people were to report different players at once. It would be hard enough work to even try to catch up with it. There are a ton of people who insult each other on Roblox, it's pretty common now. Like calling each other noobs for example, and I see that Roblox's scripting is very cool and even the news said a person payed their college funds by scripting and educating themselves. Now, there is a whole ton of Online Daters...It is very, VERY common in Roblox right now. They're practically every where, which you should possibly avoid or block if things get too worse, the violence isn't that bad. There isn't too much blood nor, any gore here unless it's the developer or creator who made a game with blood in it. This makes it very easy to keep your child safe by blocking games and they also have a censor system that can be annoying but safe I guess.","Adult"
"age 10+","It's good for kids. But sometimes there are people called ODer who are Online daters. This could be dangerous for kids. They could make the kid trust them to ask where they live. You never know who is behind the computer screen. But some games are amazing and kid-friendly.","Adult"
"age 13+","It depends who you’re kid is. In my opinion Roblox has good stuff like education and things like that but games can have violence like murder mystery 2 jailbreak &amp; madcity And much more. But Roblox is a run safe online multiplayer game. If you’re kid has a bad influence DO NOT LET YOUR KID PLAY THIS GAME! And moderators do a
bad and unfair job so keep that in mind. and there’s free robux scams everywhere. But. Teach the kid you cannot get free robux. In any Roblox game!!! Please note online interactions I cannot rate. So online interactions can be a little inappropriate. And discord and twitter are 13+ sites so to avoid you’re child from clicking social media links please do not let your kid play ROBLOX. And there are child predators that pretend to be a child and try to get the kid to tell them you’re location. The kid needs to know NOT TO TELL ANYONE IN ANY GAME YOU’RE LOCATION. But if you’re child can handle all this stuff! LET THEM PLAY ROBLOX BECAUSE ITS A FUN GAME AND IT HAS EDUCATIONAL VALUE! Sure it has some, safety concerns but the safety on Roblox is getting better!!! Now that’s it.","Adult"

"age 13+","Hello! My name is Kaslina, a mom of 2 children, ages 8 and 11. My 11 year old found out about roblox through a classmate. She said that she have roblox and wanted my daughter to friend her.

I saw alot of games with family/dating involved, I question myself saying ''What is this game?'' She joined a game called ROBLOXIAN highschool, and everyone called her a noob. She asked me for 400 'robux' the roblox money. My 8 year old saw this and wanted 400 robux too. I gave them the robux, because i didn't want to see them sad, and the next day i saw my 11 year old dating a roblox boy!

"age 18+","Y'all being cowards. I played Roblox for 5 Years and I been around a while. Yes there is bad parts of Roblox. Like Toxic Players, Scammers,Hackers, And Nasty content. But that's just because Roblox has been corrupted since the passing of the Owner of the game. (The Owner died in 2013) I'm sure Roblox can become a great place for games. Yes I'm aware the moderation of the website is stupid. I reported someone once and they done darn crap about it. But fyi reporting doesn't work anymore. I'm sure they read them but they just don't bother them I'm guessing. But other than all that the game is the greatest thing I've ever played. If your at least 13 or older I'd recommend playing it. But don't do anything stupid like stealing your parents money for Robux, Hack, Scam or bully or do anything sexy like try to online date. (The worst thing you can do) Just be safe when you play Roblox and you will be absolutely fine! I love Roblox to death! If you don't like the game. Then scram and play another game simple.","Adult"
"age 8+","Roblox is a great platform for your kids or teens to make friends, build their own games, and have fun. If you're a parent who likes to shield their children from violent video games, there is a lot more to Roblox than just violence! There's roleplaying games where your child can pretend to live life as an adult, going out with friends to accomplish tasks in a virtual city. Or if you don't want your kids to play video games, they can BUILD them aswell! Roblox is a platform where kids and teens come to use code and aswell construct objects to come up with their very own games! I've even made games on Roblox myself. The only problem with Roblox is that the community isn't as good as other games. But there are safety features where on your specific account, you can disable communication with other players and messages aswell! Besides that, Roblox is a great place for children to come and learn to construct their own worlds. If they get bored of building, they can also play the millions of games users have created on Roblox. I really recommend Roblox to your kids. Just monitor them, because there's people on Roblox who Online Date, even though it is against Roblox TOS Rules and Guidelines, and your kid can get in trouble for doing so. But besides that, have fun on Roblox!","Adult"
"age 13+","honestly to me roblox is actually starting to become a 13+ game than 10+ because most users now is doing things that are not allowed but roblox admin do nothing about it most of the time i know this because i used to play roblox","Adult"
"age 12+","Alright, I thought AJ was bad.
So, heres some things You need to know about Roblox,
1) There's tons of sex, usually You'd be thinking You're child is playing a safe game usually it is other ''Children'' playing, I see these people as Pedophiles only because they are commonly caught asking to meet up, or having sex with younger ages.
2) Parents believe that there is no swearing, but in the game Meep City I've commonly seen it. Some uses censors and others actually bypasses the filters. Moderaters really do nothing.
3) Violence is crazy, I've been threatened about being murdered many times it ain't My experience I'm worried about it's the younger ages.
4) Everything costes ''Robux''. Okay, I get every game has it's ingame money and meets requirements to get it. But if You want anything, You need Robux.
5) Parents says they see people on Animal Jam who does things connected with Drugs, Drinking, or Smoking. But Roblox is crazy. Such as ''The Boys &amp; Girls Dance Club'' it has drugs, Beer/Alchol, and commonly used as a Strip Club.
6) Roblox Anthro just didn't help anything within the game.
I highly believe it's for 12+
I would not reccomend the game to any children under the age of 12.","Adult"

Roblox is 3D designed game for all age groups with currency""Robux"" which can be bought with real money or builders club. Roblox have chat filters to prevent users from swearing or giving their private information close to impossible to bypass on the other hand, there are Online daters looking for ""Boyfriends or Girlfriends"" but ROBLOX interviews with that sort of things. Also, saying ""noob"" is common word not a swear word, that usually happens when you do something stupid or even try. Noob means new to the game based on word ""Newbie"" used since 1800s. Its ok to have your own opinion but, saying roblox is innapropiate for children, dont all the time believe the medias try out yourselfes! Roblox very rarely affected childs' behaviour if it was already that sort of behaviour thats not the point.
So, my conclusion about ROBLOX is its family friendly game. Don't worry about innapropriate content its always deleted.","Adult"
"age 2+","Roblox is a world wide free game that allows one to make internet friends. Roblox has updated and has programmed it to censor any foul language meaning no cursing, bulling, or inappropriate comments. You can play games by other characters or even make your own game. Roblox has even started a new program called ""It is cool to be kind"", roblox cares about your safety, so roblox bans any hackers found in the game.","Adult"
"age 8+","Very good game, who like minigames. Also, if you dream to create games and know scripts, you can create your own game. But, who plays from medium or poor countries, is mainly think that ROBUX and builders club is expensive.","Adult"
"age 7+","While some games may have slight violence, there's never any gore, and they're usually 13+. Roblox has many options for limiting what type of games show up for kids, and they are making huge strides when it comes to preventing bullying, hacking, and unfairness.
Some games like ""MeepCity, Robloxian Highschool, and Royale High"" indirectly encourage online dating, but that's mostly the community's fault, and it's not all that goes on in those games. Roblox has been cracking down on games like this recently aswell, especially with MeepCity.
Overall a solid platform, fun games, community isn't always the best in all games though. The game is free to play, no need to pay a cent to have fun.","Adult"
"age 18+","Watching my daughter play the 13 and under version of the game, I was shocked to see how much violence is encouraged on the game. On the game called Mars Baby Simulator, your avatar is encouraged to ""kill"" other characters by punching them. I heard a replay of a programmed voice that kept repeating ""killing spree"" as the characters punched each other to kill each other. This positive verbal reinforcement coming from the game as characters kill each other is very dangerous for children as they are still making sense of the world. Our childrens' minds are constantly receiving positive reinforcement as they ""kill"" other characters in the game. Even with the extra layer of security I placed on the account, I still saw many instances of encouraged killing on the game. I chose to delete the game so my 8 year old daughter will not be desensitized to murder/violence . Although it happens in cartoon form - it is still violence acted out repeatedly, which is not acceptable. Please think twice about downloading this game. This is so troubling to see these kids being so addicted to this game. Roblox does not care about the lasting mental affects on our kids. Roblox should be ashamed of themselves.","Adult"
"age 2+","The game learns children about communism. It's good to learn about communism and politics lmao.","Adult"
"age 13+","Roblox might seem like a friendly community but the common sense reviewers think there’s education most of these are violent and have blood effects,guns,and fighting.I do not recommend this to younger kids because I older kids have found a way to bypass and say swears in acyonyms and more.","Adult"
"age 8+","I have been playing Roblox for almost 5 years now, and there has been ups and downs. Many people say that Roblox is very inappropriate for young viewers, which in some cases are correct. Hackers and exploiters will find a way to hack into a game, or even peoples accounts. But Roblox has a chat filter. Certain words that are considered bad will be replaced with hashtags. And Roblox gives you the choice to turn on 'Two-Step Verification' which is two steps to get into your account, which is two steps more for someone to get into your account. On Roblox you can upload pictures. Moderators will be scanning them first, if is considered bad, the person who uploaded the picture will be get a warning, or banned. If there is someone you think is doing the wrong thing, you can report them for whatever reason. Games can be flagged, so as comments on your feed, an outfit, groups, and the list goes on. In my opinion, Roblox is good if you have everything planned out and secure. Roblox (I think is) is kinda an educational platform. It can teach you jobs, like Frappe or Bakies Bakery. It can also teach you building, like Build a Boat And Find Treasure or Bloxburg. Or even survival skills, like Escape Room or Natural Disaster Survival. I think anyone should try it.","Adult"
"age 9+","I have been playing Roblox for 4 years now and I dont see anything wrong with the game itself, but the game has gotten so big to the point where the are not enough Moderators and Administrators to be able to safely and effectively manage the community. I know Roblox will acknoledge this problem and I know that they are hiring new people to work for them frequently, since they have seen their playerbase double over the last 2 years, from 500M to 1B. Regarding the community, people can be toxic sometimes and pretend that they are better than everyone else because they have ""cool clothes"" or ""expensive hats"". If you ingnore this part though, I think you're gonna have a good experiance playing Roblox.","Adult"
"age 8+","Roblox is a fun game with a variety of games, although consumerism and the ability to buy the online currency of robux is common to see, this is the only major trouble. The helicopter parents that claim the game is ""Sexual"" or that their child was sent pornographic messages is false. Don't get turned off by those imbeciles, they've never actually experienced the game. The game is fun and well rounded, just look out for consumerism here and there.","Parent of a 12-year-old"
"age 9+","I am a child, but, like others, i’ve posted this on parents to get their attention. I know other people have different opinions, and I respect that. I will be going over all of the CommonSenseMedia categories in detail.
Many are complaining about the “sexual content” on ROBLOX. I’m here to tell you, in my three or four years on ROBLOX, I have never seen such things. Of course, I’ve heard about them, and seen one inappropriate game, but it was taken down quickly. The quote un quote sexual content isn’t an issue if you educate your children on what to do if they see it. It’s a simple block and report situation. As for online dating, the rumors ARE true. Again, this is just something that you need to teach to your children. Just tell them that it is wrong. I don’t see online dating as much anymore, though it’s true that ROBLOX hasn’t been doing anything to help it. Another problem, in that category, is the pedos. This, sadly, is true. I have, again, never come across one, but they exist. I can assure the parents out there that your kid is not very likely to come across one. In fact, I can only think of a few instances where they haven’t been banned or terminated. These instances usually happen OFF-GAME though, on Discord or other chat rooms. ROBLOX clearly states that they are not responsible for things that take place off-site.
The violence in this game is acceptable. Sure, there ARE detailed weapons, but that’s OK. When you die, you break into small pieces as a LEGO character would do and make an “oof” sound. This really isn’t anything graphic. You let your children break apart LEGOS after all, right?
Swearing is not an issue. In fact, it’s the opposite. Everything you try to say in ROBLOX (including numbers) is moderated and comes out in hashtags. So, I don’t really think that swearing is a problem. Of course, as one user mentions, you only have the occasional “hell”.
There is absolutely NO drinking, drugs, or smoking. I don’t get why others say there is. There’s the occasionally drinking, but it’s minor when it happens.
Consumerism isn’t a big issue. All you need to know is that there are ads leading off the main ROBLOX website. If you are on mobile or XBOX, however, this isn’t a problem.
Safety and privacy concerns definitely need to be addressed. There are games in ROBLOX that will definitely try to scam you, taking your account or ROBLOX. These are easy to avoid though, if you educate your kid on which games not to play. They are easily spotted, with a Robux icon for a thumbnail, or no thumbnail. Even the title is something like “FREE ROBUX”. In-chat scamming is just a block and report thing, again, the term free robux is common. It’s not ROBLOX’S responsibility if your kid gets scammed by an off-site link, as mentioned above in my sexual content paragraph. Privacy concerns, again, it’s a matter of educating your child! You can set certain restrictions, too, in ROBLOX’S settings. It will make the game more dull for your child, though. Currently, there is NO way you can get hacked (unless your kid gives out their username and password) or get a virus from ROBLOX. I can say that the launcher is safe and virus-free. The only way to get viruses is to download certain audio off the website, most people don’t know how to do this and don’t use it.
Lastly, great messages. ROBLOX has some positive messages such as:
-Conserving money (robux)
-Friendship
-Focusing on school
-Rasing a family correctly
-Raising pets correctly
That concludes my report on ROBLOX. Overall, I think it is a great and safe game. All the concerns on here are highly overexaggerated.

"age 16+","Well.. When i started playing ROBLOX it's been great!
The games around ROBLOX can be all kinds, there are games like ""jailbreak"" and other's can be violence but ROBLOX should update for age rated games for the Home Page. So there is many games but all together it's fun!!","Adult"
"age 18+","Some time ago my son played roblox a lot until I recently saw him and a stranger doing innapropiate things. The man had hacked porn on the wall and was getting my kid to say weird stuff. Also people treat other players mean and call them nubs and they curse in ways that is not blocked out in hashtags. There was a drug game a Roblox call of duty game that was called pantom freces. Its an overall horrific game. Not only that my 8 year old son is now addicted to this game every time I tell him not to play that game he throws a tantrum and smashes doors and hits me and says he hates me and wants me to die I have to do something about this do not let your kid play this game ever please.","Adult"
"age 8+","Roblox is a platform for kids. There is a currency that can only be earned, by spending money but it should not affect the game that much. Some people can bypass the roblox chat filter but if they do cuss, you can report them and they can get a warning or ban. Players can also upload decals, T-shirts, shirts, and pants but when you upload them, they will not be shown yet. A moderater will check it and if it's inapropriate it will be denied. This game can even help you get a job because you can learn how to script a game. Roblox is free. Roblox is for people to express their imagination to other players.","Adult"
"age 6+","Hello! Well, ROBLOX Is a great game! I have no doubts on that. Well...
The reviews are a bit... 'Overreactive' So, i've decided to make this review First of all: ROBLOX is a kids game. Yes, there is scams etc. But ROBLOX is very fast on that. People with inappopriate language too. Well just to say one thing. ROBLOX does NOT support online dating.
unlike The old ROBLOX admin... alexnewtron. He actually supported them. But he got fired after as i know. (he dosen't have the admin badge anymore) So. No worries on that. Inappopriate now... parents...
Ya' see. maybe people might have ""robucks"" as you call it (its robux i know it) ROBLOX HAS to get money in order to keep the site running.
And Overall. its great! (Fair amounts of ROBUX isn't expensive and BC (Builders Club) Gives an extra bonus, For the first-time purchase.)
How ya' parents see it is: ""OmG WhAt Is ThIs My ChIlD is hAvInG a CoNvErSaTiOn?!??!?!?"" like... WHY?","Adult"
"age 13+","","Adult"
"age 11+","I have been playing roblox for 2 years I love it. All games have bullies because that is the real world. Roblox offers many different styles of content. Lots of games have educational value and Teach things like relationship value, such as role play games where you have ""a family"" Overall I think roblox is a great game platform and should be played by those over ten because if you can't even functionlly play you will most definitely get bullied.","Adult"
"age 18+","A few things you must note. 1. There are games that encourages self-harm. A few I ran into after asking my kids, Like jumping off a cliff to see how many bones you broke, the more you break the higher your points are, or jumping off the tallest building to gain points. Though you don’t see blood shed, but the idea is really bad. 2. Robbing banks to get money. 3. Murdering. 4. If your age setting is older, more chance your kids will see inappropriate words. 5. Strangers impersonating to be kids, and start asking them to do stuff. I read that on the news!! Parents must be very very alert, and must tell your kids never to speak to or add strangers to be friends!!
There are millions of games there, who knows what they’ll pick next, and I saw oneRoblox game call “suicide” .","Adult"
"age 6+","aight, so recently i've been seein' a ton of parents and children calling this game the spawn of satan, but i'd have to disagree. honestly, this game is just to have fun, yeah, there's creeps n stuff, but those are rare, and most of the time it's older children messin around. mk i'm too lazy to add more gn","Adult"
"age 9+","This game encourages imagination, and many other things! but some people can be disgusting sometimes but, overall really great game!","Adult"
"age 6+","So basically parents are saying this game is dangerous and creepy, And people are saying they are pedophiles and abusers on the website, Well open your mind
There is a 0.1% chance you will be attacked by a predator.
There is a 0.1% chance your child will be encouraged to buy guns in real life because of the weapons in the catalog.
Thanks for reading my review, please understand that ROBLOX is not dangerous or creepy in any way, Bye.","Adult"
"age 8+","So. Basically its not Roblox's fault. Its the community.","Adult"
"age 12+","One thing is that many people make scary and violent games. Granny and Fortnite were remade on ROBLOX. People also give a lot of information and pretend to have crushes on people. That's not a good thing. People should play with people they know... ONLY!","Parent of a 7, 9, 15, and 17-year-old"
"age 6+","ROBLOX is a really fun game. Although, everything you can buy is super expensive. And if your children ""date"" on ROBLOX they can get kidnapped.","Adult"
"age 10+","Roblox isn't as bad as you people put it. God, quit over exaggerating.
First off, about the ""sexual messages."" If you find that your kid is being bothered by horny 3-year-olds that want to steal their Roblox virginity, block the person. It's not that hard, there's literally a
""block"" option on the person's profile.
Second, MONITOR YOUR CHILD'S BEHAVIOR ONLINE. I can't stress this enough, it's like people here don't care what their child is doing and leave them alone on the computer 24/7 and then wonder why their child is cussing. Just download a computer monitoring software, for crying out loud. If you don't want your innocent little Timmy seeing the bad bad words that are oh so threatening, get him off of Roblox. Take away the computer or phone. Ground him. Do SOMETHING other than just whine about it to your other soccer mom friends.
Third, inappropriate games. I can tell you, they do get removed if they have sexually explicit content. Another thing: enable two-step verification if you don't want your child's account getting hacked.
Finally, the ads are either user-made by Roblox players advertising their game or their just ads made by companies. If you don't want Timmy seeing a bad bad advertisement, get an ad blocker. If you're on Google Chrome, I suggest uBlock Origin. It's what I use. It's not that hard, Karen.
On the note why this is 4 stars, I do find the online dating and the community to be toxic at times, but you really can't do anything about the community. You can't change the way other people behave. The moderation system is complete dog s***, as for many other communities and games out there today. About the ODing (Online dating), it traces back to MONITORING YOUR CHILDREN.","Adult"
"age 10+","I think Roblox is a fun game for kids.","Adult"
"age 7+","ROBLOX is a good game, it has some educational things as well as it lets you code and power your imagination and lets you build what ever you’ll like, although if someone creates anything inappropriate like the males area an administrator will look over the model/decal it will decline it. It also lets you play mostly everything you’ll like from a prison escape game to simulators, so basically you/ your child would like. You can create a character for free by taking apart a in events or getting things from the catalog, although you can buy a currency called ‘Robux’ to make your character kinda better, it costes from £4.99 to just over £100 ( they sell these so they can keep ROBLOX running) You can buy three different types of a thing called ‘Builders Club’, Outrageous Builders Club (£20:00 monthly) Turbo Builders Club (£10-15 can’t remember) or Builders Club, the benefits of buying these is you earn 15 robux (BC), 35 robux (TBC) or 60 robux (OBC). There is cartoony guns,paintball guns, swords, weapons and bombs but there is no gorey graphics, If someone starts cussing ROBLOXs filter will tag it (like hashtags). People sometimes OD (Online Date) but it is against the terms and they can be given a warning or well,banned. I hope this helps you decide if you’d let your child(ren) play and if not you should try it out yourself","Adult"
"age 12+","I think Roblox is a good game but if you are going to allow your child to play it please monitor your children as some games are not friendly despite the ""Safe Chat"" feature. You can disable chat in the settings of the Roblox account if you want.","Adult"
"age 13+","ROBLOX is a friendly fun kids game. Most of these games inside are child friendly including Deathrun, Flood Escape 1, Work at a Pizza Place, Epic Minigames etc. A lot of people say consumerism is a big factor, I beg to differ. I pay for TBC every month, and it's a fair price considering I get 20 groups for it. However, there is a bad side to it. ROBLOX has worked very hard to fix the community up and has done well but not enough. There is alot of people who will bypass the chat filter and audios and decal filter. Some of these bypasses can be explicit and even racist. This doesn't happen often, unless you go looking for it. So all in all, ROBLOX is safe for the ground level games and decently mature children.","Adult"

"age 18+","My child was harassed by other users and the response I was given by the Roblox Support was very vague and delayed. No action was taken. My daughter is no longer allowed to play the game.","Adult"
"age 9+","Roblox is a game where I think, is 9+
There is violence and weapons in it and the players... Oh wow some of the players. Roblox has been getting better about this though, and the violence isn’t too much. Is just you die, no blood or anything.
Yes, you do have to pay money for robux but that’s because that’s one of the only ways to keep roblox free. So it’s no big of a deal.
In here you can make games and learn how to. It’s a great way to give a child imagination. I’ve been playing it since 2016 so I would know.
P.S, the word “ Noob “ is for new player. So if you’re called a noob then that means that you are a new person to the game or acting like one.","Adult"

this game allows kids to make and play games, (!make clothes, (!make groups, and have fun.
this game has values in coding, learning real-world things and making friends but be alert because they are people who bully and pretend to be children also the in-game currency ROBUX and the member-ship builders club costs REAL DOLLARS if you see your child entering bank details or if you get an email saying you bought (!ROBUX or (!builders club, stop your child immediately and talk to them there are things like the broken admin bots and people saying noob and other bad parts I could tear into but that will take too long so do your research and watch your child and stop them from playing every 15-20m and keep them from playing for about an hour to avoid addiction they are many things that keep me from a 5 star rating but this game is good for kids.","Adult"

"age 8+","I think it has value, it teaches you to build, and be smart. Yes there are oders, but you need to kids to be smart and safe. The maker has a kid so he knows what he is doing.

- For younger children, enable ""restricted mode"" and disable ""chat"".","Adult"
"age 13+","Roblox is a great game. There is MANY problems with it that are easy to avoid. Although roblox is ok for under 13 users, they dont get the full experience. Many things are blocked off for younger users, back when i was under 13, i had to lie about my age to have fun. Many things in roblox can be very overwhelming. There is some users that will play loud, inappropriate music that young children shouldnt hear. Online dating is big in roblox, despite it being against the rules. This is not a privacy concern. Roblox's chat is so strict that you cant say anything too privacy concerning. Hackers are big on roblox, but they cant do much. The worst thing they can do is shutdown games. The will sometimes ""rape"" some people. This is mainly a way to get there reaction and does not mean they are a predator. If someone says something NSFW (Not Safe For Work) to someone, dont be worried. Theyre just trolling. Roblox is only fun/safe for people that are 13+.","Adult"

"age 9+","To me, ROBLOX is not only a game, it’s a place to learn, and even have virtual ‘ jobs ‘ in groups of roblox.
First of, you can play a lot of fun games like Jailbreak, although it has guns, it has NO blood or violence, kids will surely enjoy being a cop or a criminal robbing banks. Secondly, if there is blood, it’s only a decal in order to make some games look realistic, such as a zombie apocalypse RP, and more.
ROBLOX is also educational, such as you can learn about scripting, developing fun games, all the games on roblox are made by players! If you do not know how to do anything, ask on a group wall, or search up the web, surely someone can help you!
ROBLOX also has a strict chat system that tags every possible bad word or sensitive information, such as you can’t type phone numbers, your home, your real name, swear words and more. It is guaranteed that you have a. Safe experience. Although there may be exploiters that may ruin the game, it’s a rare chance and they often do it for fun, for YouTube videos and more.
Lastly, your kid can experience virtual jobs like working in a Hotel, Cafe, Restaurant, Law enforcing Agency, and more. It will be sure to prepare your son to adapt the real life working environment. However, you do have to interview or do an application like applying for a job IRL. Recommended virtual working areas are, Hilton Hotels, Soro’s restaurant. There are also some airline groups which make ‘ flights ‘ for people to enjoy!
There is also a game currency call Robux, you buy them with real money to buy game passes, Stuff to customise your character / avatar and more.
Lastly, I hope you do enjoy Roblox and hope this is useful!","Adult"
"age 2+","Roblox is one of the best games ever and it teaches your kids how to code and helps make them learn what's clickbait and what's not like for example: OBBY OBBY OBBY OBBY OBBY is going to be clickbait and they could learn from that.","Adult"
"age 6+","Someone who is currently 11 1/2, I believe ROBLOX is an amazing game. Yeah, it may have violence and inappropriate things but that is the reality of our world and we have to deal with it. You should monitor your kid how you want to. There are many fun games for all people. Royale High, ROBLOX High School, and more. Yes, online dating happens but that happens on Club Penguin, Minecraft, Animal Jam, Fantage, and more. We live in a society where things like this happen. And yes, if you want to have your player to look ""cool"" or ""rich"" you will need to buy Robux which is a virtual currency to buy items on the site. Yes, you can't get it by playing games but by only buying BUT if ROBLOX didn't have any people buying stuff on their site than how would they grow? Things like this happens in Club Penguin and Fantage as well! There are also good games for your child to experience a virtual job and they require grammar which helps your child in English and Language. If that's not enough, you can also build in script in a thing called ROBLOX Studio which lets you make games and publish them! And they also can learn to script their games which learns young children into coding. They can ALSO learn how to make Graphics Designing and can help them in many careers. Yes, they're user created games but you have to understand that if your child stumbles across a game like that they need to be a big person and ignore it and play a game that is appropriate for them.","Parent of a 12-year-old"

I personally disagree with the reviews, they are just rude. The admins, creators, game devs, spent lots of times on the game! They don't know how hard it is to create a perfectly scripted, built, updated game without it having any bugs. I can admit some people get scammed but, if you actually got scammed while trading in a game , don't give up on the game because you lost your good items. Roblox can still be good without being rich on it. Although some people online date they probably do it for roleplay stuff. If they are serious inform an admin.

Make a account for roblox?","Parent of a 9 and 16-year-old"
"age 8+","So ROBLOX is family friendly and its very fun right? It has so many cool and creative games so yeah it is great and i really think its a good expirience but there are dark parts of ROBLOX. Why i think roblox could be recommended for kids 8+ is mostly because kids younger than that may not be able to handle the violence depends on which games (not all the games are violent) as there is so many kids that think its cool to swear or they are trying to be mature on a kids platform as well as there are ODERS (online daters) that like to do questionable stuff but its mostly in roleplay games so if you dont play those games your good. Thats it I might have forgot something but overall its a bit violent but its a good game i would suggest to play. It might get boring after some time due to the lack of games though.","Adult"

"age 10+","So, I’ve been playing ROBLOX since I was like 7. And I would see online daters doing really gross stuff and making gross games, and by that point ROBLOX has a rule to no online date. But ROBLOX never did anything about that situation. Moving on to the bullying, most people in ROBLOX like to bully kids that are 13 and under and call them “noobs” and ROBLOX doesn’t do anything about this either.","Adult"
"age 10+","My sons account was hacked and his email address was hacked...they asked me to provide the pin number of a previously used gift card which was ridiculous as who would keep this info??? VERY HARD TO DEAL WITH AND NOT SAFE","Adult"
"age 7+","ROBLOX is a fun and educational game for children. There are games like Jailbreak, Prison Life v2.0.2 and more. My only problem is the ROBLOX scam games and games like MeepCity. ROBLOX scam games hunt for your password. MeepCity encourages online daters, The player community is great!
There are tags what are spam. (E.G.) MEEPCITY MEEPCITY MEEPCITY MEEPCITY MEEPCITY MEEPCITY MEEPCITY MEEPCITY JAILBREAK ect* what are minor problems.
My review would be a 9.5/10
The currency, ROBUX costs real money, it is worth it though. To buy game-passes and character customisation. Gears are the problem though. They usually don't work for these 'R15' characters.
This is my review. Other reviews do not fully include this information.","Adult"
"age 18+","Ok. I've been on roblox since 2007 and it was great at the time but then it grew and heaps of crappy people started playing. my worst experience on roblox is having people hack games and molester your character. its absolutely disgusting and no matter what game you play, there will always be a hacker there. Ive spent over $500 on this game to enhance my characters looks and for gamepasses but in the end, its not even f###### worth it because the hackers will find a way to wipe your data and cause trouble. there is also a massive hole in the roblox 2fa security system that is easily bypassed if you know how, so I don't suggest spending lots on roblox. Its genuinely a horrible game because of all the trolls, griefs and hackers. don't let your child play it or they will get addicted. PS - the kids there bypass the swearing filter way too often and abuse it like hell","Adult"
"age 10+","I like the game a lot and I think everyone should play it, however what parents actually have to worry about and don't listen to some parents reviews that say ""Oh there are inappropriate stuff"", I mean there is but if your child doesn't start playing some games that are totally of course and like nobody is playing them it's ok, the top games aka the most popular games never have inappropriate things, believe me I have played it for a long time, some people say that in ROBLOX people call each other mean things and 'noobs' which is correct, but that happens in every multiplayer game and you can't avoid it so I suggest your child doesn't really get offended by it and should ignore the negative people because the game itself is really fun and they shouldn't let someone ruin the experience for them. Ok now on the main point that I wanted to say parents should warn their kids before they start playing ROBLOX is that there are a lot of scammers that will take your account, but don't let that prevent you from letting your child play, it is very easy just to avoid those scammers, so for me to tell you how to do it I gotta tell you what scammers make scams for and that's Robux which is an in game currency that you buy with real money using a credit, debit, gift and many other types of cards, so the scammers will usually send a link to their ""Free Robux"" site, which won't give your child free Robux their account will only be stolen or they'll do a bunch of surveys that give the person owning the site money and your child nothing, so before your child starts playing you should tell them there is no way to earn free Robux and that they should not accept friend requests from people that usually have usernames like this: U2kajhO20kcmzl01y20 (or something like that) and the scammers usually have some green/red skin colors, blocky heads and an ugly man face. If your child uses one of those free Robux sites, they might get their account stolen so as I said before but I will say it again, tell them there is no way to earn free Robux, unless it's a giveaway made by a YouTuber that has at least 100k subscribers aka followers, but a GIVEAWAY not a video that has been made by a YouTuber telling you how to get free Robux. That's it I suggest you let your child play this game, however there are some games that have blood in them but it's nothing too violent, the blood doesn't look realistic and it comes from a LEGO figure so in my opinion, it's nothing too serious, I personally find the game fun and I think your child will too","Adult"
"age 7+","Here's the thing. all the other stuff is bad. but the main games, not some game that doesn't have a good title. yes there is violence, but you can avoid those games. the game isn't bad. the community is bad. But it got better, there are tags. People are saying that because their daughter got it hacked or whatever. that only happens rarely. Plus, hackers would probably make their stats better and stuff. If they do that, they probably aren't pedophiles, they're probably people who just think it' funny. also, pedophiles could just be horny 12 year olds.","Adult"
"age 6+","Yes.
I lied about my age to make sure you all see this. Okay, so I'm actually a 10 year old, but I'll just get to the point.
So, yes, there is violence. (Now I'm making myself feel bad for mutilating people in roleplay on ROBLOX...) There IS sexual content as well as other bad crap for younger kids. Tell your kid not to play games like MeepCity, Adopt and Raise a Cute Kid, Boys and Girls Hangout, ect. if you would not like them to see it (which you most likely won't).
It isn't new to have pedophiles in kids games. Not at all. Teach your kid about internet safety lmao
Now, about the ones that say it's too addicting...
O NU MY LITTE BILY PLAYZ ROBLOX FOR HRS AFTER BEDTIM ROBLOX IS BANND
Seriously. If you don't want your child to do that, either REMIND THEM when its their bedtime or don't let them play any video games at all. Any game can be addicting. As for the violence, cursing and bullying, the bullying has stopped, cursing not so much. I do curse on roblox when roleplaying, but that's about it.
Also the moderation is freaking terrible. AT LEAST READ THE REPORTS REUWJHIJEEJWKA
Now for the good crap!
ROBLOX is super fun and addicting! I started playing when I was 6, and my favorite game was Neverland Lagoon. But it's just really the developers, such as myself, who make the platform so fun!
...although I do remember making a gorey game once when I was about 8 years old and pretending the characters getting killed were my irl rivals. Fun times, fun times...","Adult"
"age 10+","I myself play roblox quite a lot and I think that it is a great game for kids to play!
There are a lot of good cartoonish like games. But, there is also some flaws. There is a chat feature in-game that lets you chat to the other people that are in the same game as you. Luckily, there is a chat filter that prevents most inappropriate chat. (language, profanity etc.) And it has a option for you to block and mute someone that will prevent you from seeing there chat/messages. The game is based off of you playing games made by other people in a blocky, lego type environment. There are ways for the people to make inappropriate games but almost all of the time they will get banned/deleted. If people are constantly doing bad things against roblox’s terms of service, (bullying, exploiting, inappropriate chat, adult content, etc.) there account will be banned/deleted. Along with that, Roblox does approve of reasonable content of horror games. The games can have horror elements such as jumpscares and very few sences of blood. I think that is fine for a 10/11 year old that can handle jumpscares. I think that this game is awesome and creative and I think that any 10+ year old could handle it.","Adult"
"age 8+","There is too much online daters in roblox but i learned English from Roblox for 3 years and ive found alot of friends such as famous people too you should play roblox but if you don't want to meet any online daters just dont play any RP games like :

"age 8+","ROBLOX is said to be one of the best MMO games ever, and I can see why. Millions of user-created games for your child to play, chat with friends, and so much more. But the downside...
Scammers, hackers, bullies, ect.
Until it gets out of control, I would just ignore them all. There are ""Report abuse"" buttons on-site and in-game so you can do something about it. Also, maybe monitor your kid from time to time.
98/100 would surely recommend.","Adult"
"age 18+","I played this game for roughly 6 years of my life. I'm older now so i don't play it anymore. But i used aprox around 1000+ dollars on the game back then. And i had a inventory worth of over 1 million robux.
I got hacked 3 years ago. And i asked for their help because i couldn't remember the bonded email to my account. So i told them ""Guys i got hacked and he stole my stuff. I don't got access to my account please help me, i can't remember the bonded Email""
Many days later i get an email ""Your stuff has ben restored"" While the hacker still had access and i didn't. So he just gained like 2 million robux profit.. Now I'm trying to get my stuff back... About 40 emails later they still ignore the fact that they made a mistake!!
Roblox tells me if i keep emailing them on this issue they will block me. So lost fight for my stuff i guess..
""Please note that Roblox's employes can't restore items to an account if it isn't the bonded email requesting it"" And it wasn't the bonded email and they did anyways
Please don't spend money on this game if there is a risk of them not wanting to deal with their problems..","Adult"

"age 5+","There is a game named ROBLOX who my kids started playing in 2016. I was a bit sceptical to it, but I let them try it. I helped them with their own account and actually made my own! I joined their game without them knowing and I saw what they where doing. The game was called Work at a Pizza Place and it seemed really fun! I later told them that I joined them and I said that I was going to start playing ROBLOX regularly. I started thinking who made the games and I found out that they do it in a workshop! I tried it for myself and I found out that not only could you learn stuff, but also have much fun! I told my kids this and they started learning code and making games. As a ROBLOX player, I know what is happening. Many people say that their is Online Dating, but that is not true. The people who make those reviews don’t even play ROBLOX! And if it would happen then many bad words would be like: ####. And the ROBLOX sencouring system is really good! And if someone would want to online date and would ask like: “yo wanna go to bed?” then it is simple to get rid of them. Just say: no. ROBLOX is a great game and I recommend it for five years or older.","Adult"
"age 8+","Now, I’ve been playing roblox for 8 years and I gotta say that it pretty fun. You can do so much and build what’s possible and play with friends, but there’s some dark sides. I’m not saying this game is bad but parents, I believe you should monitor your children what games they play on roblox. Sometimes People like online dating on the game which is very disgusting to me because you don’t know there age, and some games can be sexual. There’s a safe mode for children under 13, so if your child wants to play Roblox just make sure to put it on safe mode (If you want to). I’ve seen other reviews and most of these parents are overreacting, I get it, it can be inappropriate at times but there’s so many fun games to play and challenge your friends. Your child should be playing roblox if they wanted to. I’m saying, I’ve been a long time ROBLOX player and I’ll still play it to this day :)","Adult"

My 2 sons started playing and the same thing happened and then some inappropriate stuff was happening there was this game called ‘’six’’ (aka sex) and there was very nasty and inappropriate stuff on it all of a sudden a player came up and said ‘’lets do it’’ (which means sex) and I was very discussed and angry I immediately told all of them to get off the game it was so bad that the game was now banned out of my house","Adult"
"age 8+","Roblox is a kid friendly game where kids can safely communicate with other kids all over the world while playing fun games. I think that Roblox should be played by kids ages 8 and up because most of the games are too advanced for smaller children and they wouldn't find it any fun.

ROBLOX has consumed my child fully and has now broken her to she cries when someone calls her a noob. i have permently BANNED roblox from he ipad mini.

I contacted customer support letting them know that her account had been hacked. They responded saying I needed to prove the account was hers by providing the receipts for the iTunes cards. Since I didn’t purchase them I did not have a receipt. Also I don’t know why I would need to provide those as she didn’t use an iTunes card to create the account to begin with. Her sister also plays with her so we know that the person who hacked her is still using her account.

"age 15+","ROBLOX used to be a good family-friendly game for kids. Now, ROBLOX turned into a mess. First of all, in MeepCity, there is a lot of sexual people going around saying ""abc for a hot gf/bf."" Roblox doesn't ban any player who gets reported, whatever the reason they get reported. The amount of violence, is not so much in some games. But other games, there is BLOOD! Very ""family friendly"", huh? Then, the in game currency called robux, is too much money! YOU HAVE TO SPEND $200,000 ON A DOMINUS!!
And you only get 80 robux for a DOLLAR! Not to mention, there are scammers out there who STEAL your account and take the R$ that you spent your OWN MONEY on.

"age 18+","Though at first, ROBLOX may seem like a fun, kid-friendly computer game which is all about creativity and imagination, do not be fooled! Because that all of the servers on this computer game are user-created, there will naturally always be 'trolls' in the community. The unpredictability of this computer game means that extremely offensive themes will always show up, including to nudity and pornography, sexual intercourse and other sexual themes like dating and rape, inappropriate language due to the easily avoidable chat filter and extreme violence (including blood and gore, as well as heavy gun use in some servers, including suggestive language, such as ""headshots"" and ""killstreak""). As well as that, ROBLOX has a virtual currency called Robux. These Robuxes can be used to buy in game cosmestics and accessories leading to an unhealthy idea of gambling, wasting money, and an idea to young children that you need to have alot of money and the coolest clothes to be popular.
All in all, ROBLOX is an extremely dangerous computer game which is harmful for young children and even teenagers' minds, with suggestive sexual content, pornography, explicit language, intense violence as well as much more dangerous things which are certainly NOT suitable for any child.","Parent of a 9-year-old"

"age 13+","Hello. I wanted to make a review on ROBLOX, so, here I am. First, the website's currency: Robux. All of you (Or not) may already know Robux because they're playing ROBLOX or already readed posts about it. The idea of making a currency for In-game accesories is great, but the problem is that there is no way to get free ROBUX, so scammers create a LOT of bot accounts on the game itself, to make childs think it is possible to actually get free in-game currency. Second, the community. The community is not toxic. Even if it was, the majority would still be normal players trying to make friends and have fun. The problem is that a very small minority of ROBLOX players are here to actually have fun, which is sad. There are also a LOT of online daters (ODers) on games like Meepcity or Robloxian Highschool, so that's why I think every person playing these games must at least be a minimum ""mature"" to Roleplay on this . Third, the hackers/exploiters. I know hacking can be funny sometimes, but it can ruin the entire game experience of tons of players. There are also the people that bypass the chat filter (Which was created because of over reacting parents). These people can be funny, or just use it to bypass the ROBLOX censorship to tell something normal that has been censored. But sometimes, they bypass the filter to swear. Finnaly, I wanted to say that I started playing ROBLOX in 2011, and I only got banned one time. When I realised it, I was really sad, but then, when I got unbanned, I NEVER tried to troll, insult, or anything bad. I Made my 13 years-old son play a game on ROBLOX, and he loved it, so now, we always play this game.","Adult"
"age 6+","Roblox does sometimes have some innapropriate content but it is really rere (at least i never really see it), and yes bullying can occour but it is also VERY rare, trolling is not actually a problem in roblox. If that makes you not want to let your kids play it, that is fine but keep in mind that Roblox, apart from those rare occourances, is mostly positive and I myself have learned a lot from it in all different areas, it has helped me understand more about job positions and all that which can actually be really helpful in real life, and it has helped me have better grammar. Kids can also learn how to build or code in Roblox and make REAL MONEY, and a lot of people do that. Robux, the roblox currency is fairly cheap and in less than 100 Robux (Which is about like $0.80) your in game avatar (the user created character) could look very great, so that should not bother you bullying wise, even if you decide not to pay real life money, you can still make your in game avatar look good and can like that avoid bullying to the point where it barely never happens and when it does it is not a real problem. Allin all, roblox can sometimes be innapropriate but it is 99 percent of the time safe, friendly, and educational for your children.","Adult"
"age 10+","Please read all of this.
ROBLOX is a great game that promotes imagination and creativity, hence their slogan ""Powering Imagination."" Although there are some poor areas of the site like the chat filter (Does its job but sometimes filters out harmless words), it really provides kids with a way to channel their creativity and share it with their friends. This is an online game, however the chat filter filters out personal information and swearing, so it's safe. Every once in a while, an inappropriate game is published, but it never makes its way to the front page and inappropriate games are extremely, extremely hard to find. Also, exploiters/hackers are almost non-existent on the game. ROBLOX uses something called ""Filtering Enabled"" which does not allow client changes to replicate to the server without remote events. This bricks almost all the exploits used for the game, and if an exploiter does manage to make a change (e.g. replacing a wall with pornography) it will not show up on your child's device. There are also in-game purchases like Robux, the virtual currency used in the game, and Builders Club, a membership that allows you to get free Robux, a free hat, the ability to join more groups and make your own groups, and more. Also, since almost everything on ROBLOX is user-created, you can have your child make their own games, while learning how to program/script in the process! This makes ROBLOX very educational. Your child can also make their own shirts, t-shirts, pants, and more! Anything that's not a game gets put under review by the moderators, therefore making ROBLOX a very safe game. I recommend this game to children of age 10 and up.","Adult"

I had my email in it and everything..I think the person that hacked me, was knowing to be a 9 year old..What scares me is that he has all my information on all of my social medias too.. I think it was because he couldn't have any robux, which was money grabbing of him. And another thing is that all the people on clubs ect. they happen to online date and it becomes very uncomfortable and they happen to...yknow, I do not tolerate that at all and I once got banned for three days for telling them to stop, and making a group about it to help..And when I was younger playing ROBLOX my mum would happen to have money charges with buying robux for me. I dont know how it happens, but I just feel like the community should explore the site and keep a deeper eye on it.

He started playing when he was 9, now he's 14 and he still enjoys the game.
As a kid he used to spend money on stupid things. And when I asked him why isnt he spending his money he said because he wants to save.
When I asked what influenced him he said the roblox catalog system, and that it's making him more mature when it comes to money and it is driving him towards business, as in the system you can start of with a cheap item, and you can trade,invest and wait for the demand of items to rise.
Now he talks to me about business techiques all the time and I like it.
In school he was asocial and roblox has made him have more friends and being more social.

"age 6+","Honestly, if you want your child to have a good job when they are older, Roblox is the place to learn. You apply for job interviews and they are incredibly similar to the ones you get in the actual world, the questions are the same aswell. That is my favourite thing about roblox, making your own cafes or even building and developing the group yourself so you own a business in a realistic similar game. I’ve played roblox for five years now and never seen dinking/violence or anything similar to that. The ranks in the group are incredibly similar. Me and my friend own our own group and it has actual realistic fair rides with 1st person views when riding. Yes, you can build your own theme parks or fair rides. You can create anything but if it is not appropriate they are usually banned within 2 hours and these games are incredibly hard to find. You may find people asking for your password but teach your child that they just want your account and you won’t get anything they offer.","Adult"
"age 10+","Basically roblox is a build and play game. People are able to build a game and others can play it. Or you can play a game others built. There’s a catalog that allows you to purchase items for their avatar to look better. Yes, there are downsides to the community, like ODers (online daters) that play these “adopt and raise a baby” games (or similar titles). These ODers are either 8 yr olds that don’t know what they’re doing or 30-50 yr old benign pedophiles. But otherwise if you avoid these games you’re fine. Other games might be more violent, containg guns and such. But when your avatar “dies,” it just falls apart like a lego man being taken apart and scattered. Sometimes there’s blood, but it’s unusually not very graphic, usually it’s just a red circle or square to represent blood. The moderation system is ok, and could have a little work done, but is otherwise fine. The chat filter system just straight up sucks, it censors numbers (12 and under) like maybe you try to say how much I’m game currency you have but instead of saying “I have 57 coins,” you say “I have ## coins,” which in my opinion isn’t very great. But accounts 13+ are allowed to say numbers and other non-inappropriate words like “bridge” or “street.” The game creation system is pretty great. It allows you to use custom plugins found on the catalog to help with game creation and with scripts. You also use robux (an in game currency) which costs $1.00 per 80R$, but you can also earn this “R$” by making games and gaining robux through them. You can also exchange robux for REAL MONEY. There are also exploiters, these people like to ruin games or mess around in them. Like maybe in a McDonalds game a nuke could go off, or in a zombie game an angel might appear and destroy all the zombies, etc. But if you don’t like it, you can just leave and go to a different server. Roblox also has an economy of some sort, you can buy limited items and when thy you out of stock you can sell them for a higher price (like the stock market). A hat could be limited and only cost 10T$ but once it goes out of stock there’s no telling what the price could be. It could end up from 50R$ to 1234567890R$ (yes, that happened to some items). You should also look out for scams and scambots. There are minor scams like a person asms you to send you their password (pretty obvious if you understand) but then there are others like the thousands and thousands of bots sending messages to all the players telling them something like “Go to [LINK] to get FREE ROBUX today! Hurry before it’s gone!” Most of these lead to survey sites that make you sign up for stuff and give them money (because advertisement) but the others lead to websites that ask for your password. There are two sides to roblox, a good side and a bad side, and I’ve just described a bit of both.","Adult"

I love this game! I play with my best friend all the time and i really enjoy it! However,its not THE best game in existance.
Things that bother me are:
Bullying
Scam bots
Swearing (some cases)
I once joined ""Work at a Pizza Place"" when suddenly, a person started telling another person started calling them a dumbas. I tried to mix in and help,but it had the opposite effect.
But, there are always positive things to everything!
Things that i love are:
Private messaging
Groups
Multiple amazing games
I'm actually not that bothered by online dating,unless it's a safety and privacy concern. I think every player has the right to have fun and roleplay!
Also,the community. In ROBLOX. There are multiple YouTubers who are a bad influence.","Adult"
"age 18+","The game ""ROBLOX"" itself is a good game, I know hackers and other sexual stuff, yes they are in the game but, it's not roblox's moderation fault, they are trying their best to remove these kind of games, and it's the kids fault to search this kind of game.","Adult"
"age 6+","this game is fine for kids to play. yes players have toxic behavior but roblox staff try there best to ban toxic players from there game all games are ok for kids to plays there are school games baby games even shooting games with zero blood. if your child is being harassed on the game you can simply report the player then the roblox staff will 90% of the time have that player banned within 1 to 2 days. so yes roblox is a good game to play.
also ive been seeing people say that the game is full of hackers and staff dont care. this is untrue the are barely any hackers and when there is they get banned within a good amount of time.","Parent of a 9-year-old"
"age 8+","My 9 year old son asked if he could make an account for roblox, to play with his friend from school. I looked around the website and let him make an account. I explored a little bit before my son could play, to make sure there was nothing suspicious, or scandalous. The game seemed fine to me and his father, so we let him play a couple games. I could tell he was having fun, but had to keep a limit on his computer time, he was a little upset but I knew it was best for him. Once and a while I would put a chair down and watch him play with his friends and some family, making sure and guarding what he did. About a month into playing he asked if I could get him a roblox gift card for 5 dollars. I agreed because he had been doing his chores around the house. Later on he showed me his new hats, clothing, and games he bought with the ""robux"". I would sometimes find my son playing around on building games and building houses, I would watch him battle on little towers with his online friends. He continued playing for about 7 months until he asked for a little more robux. I was hesitant to agree but I did anyways. I joined him on his computer time on day interested to see what he was playing. I look up in the corner of the screen and see someone saying some not so child friendly words. so I asked him to explain to me what was going on. He told me that was a hacker, and he was going to get banned real soon. My thoughts on the game went down a little bit. Over all, I like this game, it helps my son create, make friends, hang out with friends, and just be imaginative.","Adult"

"age 10+","I've been playing Roblox ever since 2015. I can say it was nice playing it for about 4 years. The community has some bad kinks tho. There can be some games with violence, but most are very family friendly for kids and everyone. The moderations are weak tho. Roblox false bans at times and the report system don't work. Yes, I know that there are many players that Roblox has, but at least read the reports more often and stuff. There are simple ways to keep your child safe this Roblox. 1. Make sure their account is under 12. It will tag inappropriate messages. 2. Go to the settings and go to the privacy options. There are plenty of things to keep your child safe there. 3. Make sure you monitor your child's account. Verify your email too. There can be games and items over 13+. There are many other ways to make sure your child is safe. The game has robux. Robux can only be attained if purchased with real money. All the items in the game need to have robux, so if you aren't sure about spending money your child may get bullied for being ""noobs"" with all the free clothing. Most of the robux costs are high, but the best option to at least make your child not bullied if they REALLY enjoy the game is 80 robux for just 1 US dollar. The game is made entirely by its players. The players make the games! The Roblox studio is simple once you get used to it, and can inspire your kids for creativity. Online Dating is a thing on this site. If you are unsure you want your child to do that, just monitor more of just get your child out of Roblox. It is always the parent's decision. Hackers can change stuff into porn, so I recommend to let your child stay away from games that can be hacked easily (meaning that it gets hacked a lot) or just don't let the child play the game, and stay near to the child while they are playing a new game. Roblox can put a junk load onto your computer. Overall, the game can help make new friends. I have plenty of new friends on the game ever since I joined (well, until I wasn't an outcast!). The community and moderation are poor but with the right enough of protection over your child, him/her can play Roblox. It is all up to you if they can play! - clover, a 12-year-old child .p.","Adult"
"age 8+","Roblox is a really great game. Here and there though there is a few people who online date and it's safe. Roblox doesn't let you say names of anything or doesn't let you say numbers. Really though other then that it's a pretty nice game. My daughter plays it all the time. I do suggest.","Adult"
"age 6+","This game is really good, it has many games that are enjoyable.
But ROBLOX's moderation on the other hand is not that good. They might ban people for false reasons and not ban people who should get banned. Also the hashtags are way too strict, you can't even type numbers if you set your account under 13...
Robux is also kind of expensive, but there are premium payouts so you can earn Robux really fast if you make a popular game.
There is also UGC, a good feature where selected players could make hats.
If you like the old ROBLOX, don't worry, there are some games that you can play that brings you back to the old ROBLOX.
You could also chat with your online friends, want to play with them? Sure, you could join them in a game if they allow it.
Overall, ROBLOX is one of the best games I have played, would highly recommend if you know what to do.","Adult"

Except for oof. There is no swearing, people have destroyed normal chatting features at this point to even try to swear. Dont let your “kids” on this but let your teens and 11 year olds on it because most of the reports I saw were “this guy was -input something that your supposed to do here- to them and they reported them and got a warning, they contacted roblox staff why is my ___ not getting justice? And then they are pissed cause their ___’s account was deleted or temporarily banned. And 6 year olds dont know that in a fighting game, people are supposed to try and kill you","Adult"
"age 14+","Not a bad game overall, but you can easily find adult content, violence and swearing in this game.
Also, there is an in-game currency called ""Robux"" and they are not that cheap.
Let your kids play this game, but under your watch.","Adult"
"age 18+","See for yourself. I read reviews stating the in appropriate things you hear about Roblox is made up. I simply typed in “Roblox sex” in YouTube and saw for myself this game can be utterly inappropriate. Simply telling kids not to use it inappropriately is like setting a loaded gun out in the open and just “trusting” kids not to play with it. Some kids will obey and use this game “correctly” but because kids are kids and it is adults responsibility to keep them safe from their own inability to do so themselves at young ages I do NOT recommend this game for kids under 16 at best. I don’t recommend it at all actually!
I strongly advice asking your kids if they are playing this game. I was shocked to see it played in my daughter FIRST grade classroom. I am learning you can not assume your kid is safe at school. You can’t “unsee” things once you see them. I work very hard to protect my daughters eyes and it is very difficult to know this battle just got a lot harder with her in school of all places! With teachers in a classroom of 25 kids how can they police this? Ask your kids yourself if they play this at school.

"age 8+","My child started playing ROBLOX 2 years ago and ever since has had lots of fun on it. ROBLOX does have safe chat which stops your child from saying inappropriate things for their age due to when they are in the game the chat can be used to communicate with other users (even if they are not n their friends list) ROBLOX does not consist of sex or anything inappropriate for your child however there is some violence. Users can create their own games via ROBLOX studio which is very educational for children. HOWEVER, because ROBLOX is an online gaming platform there is going to be online predators, like every online gaming platform, so make sure you monitor your child and only let them accept friend requests from people they know. If you wish to switch off the chat in game this can be done in the privacy settings (I didn't for my child because my child wanted to talk to friends In game, I just told him not to talk to people that he does not know while in game. (only friends can talk outside of game and join each others game unless the settings are changed)",""
"age 2+","I have been on the fence about this website until today. Today, I blocked the website from my son's computer and uninstalled it from his iPad.

"age 18+","My 11 year old son had his account deleted at their discretion for purchasing something that was not appropriate but was on the screen and available to get from ""their"" catalog. My son, making a poor decision used this item. They then deleted the account. I sent a long apology email asking to please give him one more chance as he made an error and realizes it and I assured them it would never happen again. They wouldn't budge and kep their decision to ban him. We have spent $$$$ in Roblox purchases and I asked for a refund. They responded that they have the right to cancel at their descretion and not have to reimburse anyone. I am seeking reimbursement for the amounts paid. If they want to delete him over one stupid, kid mistake forever, that's their decision, but I waqnt to be reimbursed. Roblox is capitilizing on our children for money constanty, promoting violent shooting games and yet they act all self-righteous, cancelling a young boy's account and all the money for characters he's purchased. I intend to take them to small claiims court for the monies we've spent over the years. It is not right that they can keep all the money spent on items we purchased. Something needs to be done about this.","Adult"
"age 18+","My daughter loves this game and we've invested quite a bit of real money to purchase in-game currency (Robux) for her, when she is good.

Robux has TERRIBLE customer support and, since 12/25, has still not been able to fix the problem with her account. I suggest everyone avoid this SCAM and money pit. What a waste of time and my daughter is broken hearted. BOOOO ROBLOX&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;","Adult"
"age 5+","Roblox is unique in that your general experience varies on what sort of users you get matched with. As an adult who plays mostly ironically I’ve found that a majority of users are people like me, or slightly stupid children who feel the need to annoy the chat, and get targeted by trolls.
Generally speaking, the game is safe, with an abundance of parental controls, not to mention the in-game censoring of “inappropriate” language. Your child isn’t at risk while playing, but the overall quality of games is questionable. Yes, there are some diamonds in the rough, but a lot of the featured games are shameless cash grabs with grindy gameplay that incentives using cash to unlock features or speed up progress.
To summarize, roblox is a very mixed bag, and while it does have strengths, my experience has mostly been average, especially with the strange subcultures that exist on the site.","Adult"
"age 9+","Roblox is a game based off of people creativity and imagination. While yes, there are some people who tend to be an annoyance. In general, it can be incredibly fun. Roblox has many different games within its self, some people have created incredible games and even communities! I understand the moderation team is very small, however, I wouldn't consider their reporting system remarkable.
The types of games I brought in to were typical well-scripted games, yet later on, I was shocked to find an entire front page for the game. There were games based on prisons, simulators and many more. This would be a fabulous game for any child's imagination to roam free. Despite all of these pros, there are still many cons to this game. The moderation system simply isn't built to handle millions of users daily. Due to this, some users have become incredibly aggressive. I've sometimes seen inappropriate language centered towards me. It was my attempt to report such people, but despite this they were unpunished.
Overall I think this game would be good for children aged 9-13, due to its open worlds and creative potential. This can give almost endless fun to anyone who looks hard enough. If I had to rate it out of 10, I'd give it a 6.5/10.","Adult"

I've read other reviews, and here's my response: Roblox is a game for everyone, and has a huge variety of games that anyone can play. Roblox is also infested with hackers and exploiters that can ruin someone's gameplay experience. However, with the right knowledge and acting, you can avoid these game ruiners. How? Here are a few tips I learned. First off, don't go to outdated games. If a game hasn't been updated in a year, exploiters are bound to be in them. Second, some exploit programs get patched every Tuesday, so gameplay is recommended on Wednesdays. Honestly, some parents are extremely ignorant and don't check some facts about the game and go straight forward to deleting it and blocking it, which is why this game has such a horrible rating on this website. If you see a bad review, it's because they don't dig deep enough into the game to realize that they just got unlucky having an exploiter join the server.","Parent"

"age 10+","ROBLOX is a fun game which millions of kids play. I thought it would be smart to give it a review. The community is toxic and friendly. Its bombarded with little kids online dating making them think there cool. This is because there idols do this. The moderators do not take action to this and only ban under a stupid circumstance. Reports do not work (which is sad) and games are sometimes made for online dating. The good parts are the learning parts. Coding can be learnt and you can express imagination. You can make your dreams a reality. But sometimes, these games can be violent. Some are just bad rip offs of Fortnite (oh no not that game) and some have blood. The games can also have a small gory part to it. Like resetting. Some games make it that you don't die like you do in ROBLOX (fall into parts like legos) Sometimes they make it that you grab a gun and suicide. They also have a in-game currency called robux. The prices are way too expensive. $4.99 for 400 robux. Thats being money greedy. Other all, I think there is some cons which need to be considered, but has good parts to it.","Parent of a 8-year-old"

Other people find loopholes in the game so they can curse, such as saying s h * *, and not sh**. You can also friend complete strangers, so parents, have a good talk with youre kids about not friending people you dont know, because trust me, it can lead to unwanted things.

"age 10+","My little girl had this app downloaded on her iPad. She played it a lot, and told me it was really fun. I, being an unknowing parent, thought this app was okay. When I was sitting on the couch, I had checked her iPad and saw people saying “lol u wh0r3.” If there is a chat filter, who did this pass through? My child also had been begging me for robux. C’mon, why can’t you let a new player start out with some? To be the “cool” on Roblox, you must buy stupid in app purchases. This is ridiculous. I’ve told her that this app isn’t good for her, and she has listened. I’m glad I didn’t let her grow up with it.","Adult"
"age 8+","If my ten year old isn’t watching Dance Moms then she’s at school, sleeping, posting on social media or playing ROBLOX. She’s been playing for two years and she loves it. However the game is very addicting. It affected her grades. She’s basically now a C student, which concerns me. Her favorite game is Royale High, for sure. Some games however, like Jailbreak, can be very violent. Overall okay game but very addicting.","Parent of a 4 and 10-year-old"

"age 10+","Well i think you should ask your kids which game your kids are playing on roblox first try to stay away from these two games especially: phantom forces and murder mystery 2","Parent of a 8-year-old"
"age 8+","Now! First of all! I'll like to describe myself, I'm a Roblox Gamer and I wil not be disclosing my Roblox username due to privacy concerns but however...I will be describing the game in my own perspective...There are a lot of games that WILL include violence such as Phantom Forces and I've played this game very often...very addicting and fun but I'm not too happy that they allowed the game on Xbox One, Roblox might get 16+ rating if they don't take it down from the the Xbox One version, the rating companies such PEGI and ESRB will give it a adult/teen rating and let me warn you unfamiliar parents that the game Phantom Forces is indeed available on both platforms PC,Xbox One there's also a mobile platform which I will be getting in on later...Roblox has a really bad reputation I'll give it a 4/5 rating and there's also a important info I would like you all to know that is that.....there's a lot money in app purchases like Robux,BC,TBC,OBC, The OBC,TBC,BC are the same thing they three give the game perks but on a diffrent scale, for an example BC only gives 15 robux per day I think TBC gives 35 robux per day and OBC gives 60 robux per day, you can check the pricing for yourself,also there's a lot bullying in roblox which I've to warn you about, I'm mature enough to handle it and there's a also a report abuse feature both on site and in game, there are a few games I've to warn you about, Jailbreak(Involves robbing banks,shooting people), The phantom forces has a lot of blood, when someone gets killed they bleed out blood also when you're seriously injured and shot your screen turns red indicating blood,also there are a few FPS games that are NOT kid friendly but that does not mean all games aren't kid friendly, I will give you a suggestion about which games I approve (I've played the games I've mentioned up there) So I won't be mentiong those ones but however I will be mentioning ones for all ages,Survivor,Lumber Tycoon 2,RHS 2 (RP Games might have a very little online dating and I've never came across one) I've been playing roblox for over 2 years and I've only seen about 4 Online daters,Roblox is also releasing very bad updates recently which I belive shouldn't affect young kids and last of all, you can build a game with launguages such as Lua but I'm not a developer so I don't know much about developing but it does definetly have some educational value so you might be reconsidering Roblox for your kids, last of all scams, you can also trade but you need any of the Builder clubs, they have a montly supscription and a yearly supscription, there are trading scams, people have lost thousands of dollars to scammers and recently they are poisoned items and robuxs going around (If you manage to get your hands on any of them the easiest way to spot it is by looking at it's price if you're getting it very cheaply for an expensive 1000$ item for 2$ it could be a scam if you get it or buy it YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE TERMINATED,the poisoned items are stolen from people so the owner will get terminated and the original owner will be given back the item also there are a lot of off site scams being disaplyed on site, the launguage filter is awful but you can't just say it out the word also you can disable chatting in your childs settings also LINK YOUR EMAIL TO YOUR CHILDS ACCOUNT (Verify it with your email it should be the original email so you can close your childs account when you feel like it) Also..I've mentioned all the bad things in my knowledge, I hope you make a wise decision.","Adult"
"age 7+","Roblox's community has a bad influence against kids, showing graphic content in some cases. The problem Roblox deals with is the fact that the have to keep an eye on the user's Activities and Published content. On Roblox you are allowed to create Custom clothing and you can also modify the assets, and this allows for inappropriate Shirts, Pants and T-shirts to be made and copied that can influence a kid's mind, so if you want to let your kid to play Roblox you'll have to watch their activities.","Adult"

In all seriousness, no jokes, it’s a great game. Just be careful of scams and phishing scams. (Free robux, Free builders club, etc.) It has integrated censoring, (with hashtags (#)) and memberships called Builders Club. You can buy currency called Robux as well.","Parent of a 12-year-old"
"age 8+","This is not a game but it's better. it's an app with hundreds of games in it.
These games are great even though ROBLOX players made them! Especially Granny and Natural disaster survival. There are many other games too but these 2 are the best. Another reason, avatar. You have clothes and you can dress yourself up and you can buy more with a certain amount of robux (that's the money in ROBLOX). You can send friend requests to other players, you could accept friend requests and there are so many other stuff in it! If I told you all the other stuff, it would take hours. Anyway, I just think if you have not downloaded that app you might want download it because it is awesome! It is my favorite app.","Adult"

It brings violence to the mind, last week I was at the dinner table with my son and he forgot his homework. You know what he said oof. I did indeed search it up and it came from this outrageous game. Unlike the v-bucks this game takes my credit card to a whole new level. Cops and robbers is an activity you can play and it teaches the kids that it's fun to be a robber. There are no consequences by being chased. This game also shows sexuality to the young future adults of America. I'm a grown 40 year old man and I to have feelings when I see the female characters in this game. It is a rip-off of the well-known awesome game of Minecraft and it will poison Society.","Adult"

"age 6+","It has only been recently since I saw thousands of articles on this game called Roblox. If you haven't it's a free game online that has user submitted creations of arts, games, etc. Due to the main stream media especially in the United states, articles have been criticizing this game, and most of the parents on this website are saying that ""oh dear one minor offence happened that i could have clearly prevented by being a better parent and monitoring my child's content has just occurred who should I blame? ah of course the game developers themselves because they should be the ones that have complete responsibility of my child on their game!"" with minor exaggeration this is the parents who put 18+ 17+ and, 13+ , usually with events of hacking ,inappropriate language, and Child predatory actions. 1. simply be a better parent you know your own child if you know if he or she will be able to handle this game good! just monitor them just a little bit such as using a baby monitor in front of their screen or simply just get software on the computer they use just in case they have a situation that they can't handle themselves, But if you don't know have their account for under 13 and maybe log on to their account once in a week . 2. Their are concerning problems about the game such as lack of moderators, and the fact that it takes a while for some bad games to get deleted. 3. Hacking is somewhat of a problem but you can't blame the entire game for that matter, again monitor your kids account, i myself have played Roblox ever since 2 months of it's release in 2006, and still I've only been hacked twice both times the moderators helped me. I hope this changes you mind if you think otherwise","Adult"

"age 16+","Good Morning,
Today i am talking about Roblox and is it safe for kids Is it No it's not Thay have a Chat Filter You cant say anything with out being #### filterd out like for violence there are some gruesome games that can be for mature gamers but the next part is computer compatibility thay say
that a Old computers like 1.6GHz CPU but Thats Not the Case but you wold need a 3.5GHz for that Due to the How many Blocks are in games
also a Low End Graphic card but need a GTX 1050ti and Lower Is fine but or need a Mid Range Laptop or Desktop computer to Play Roblox just fine Ram you wold need Ram that has 2666MHz. So the Safety and privacy concern is that people or as kids can post there Private Stuff as discord,email,Where people live but you do not want some person showing up to you door you dont want that the Too Much Swearing problem as is Roblox does not want you to swear nor Make fun of people on the Web it's not cool though but one more thing is that is Roblox can False Ban You for What you Say or Do it's not what your Kids want..","Adult"

"age 12+","As a Thirteen year old and a moderator for MANY groups, I rate Roblox “The Best.” Great variety of games, never disappointed. However, I rated this 12+ since sometimes there is swearing. On the other hand, if your child is responsible and doesn’t repeat bad behavior from this game (like me), it’s an AMAZING. These games build onto creativity (ex: build a boat for treasure), give life-like responsibilities in games (ex: Bloxburg), help you endure teamwork (ex: flee the facility), etc. This is a great game and experience for millions of children. On the contrary, check on some of your young kids and make sure they don’t get TOO hooked on this game. It can be addictive. Also, tell your kids to not give out personal information to anyone OR talk about meeting up with (acctual) friends on a public chat. Can be risky! Overall, Roblox is outstanding!","Adult"

"age 8+","My son, 10, plays Roblox and it is 100% safe for kids. I have never seen him come across any harmful content at all. When I came here to see reviews, I was shocked at the ratings! All these bad ratings are from parents who do not teach their kids internet safety. This game is 100% child friendly if you teach your kids about internet safety. Don't listen to those other reviews, they are just from over-protective parents.","Adult"
"age 8+","I played Roblox since 2016, and nearly played it for 3 years, at this point I think it is time to make my review,
What is Roblox? Well let me answer you that, Roblox is a platform which makes people start coding or playing with friends, but sometimes there is the unsafe side of Roblox, sometimes there will be people giving out too much information, sometimes sexual games, but not a lot, moving on, there is this currency called Robux, you can use ""Robux"" to buy, gamepasses, clothes, hats, gears and more. If you get robux from making games, you can convert it to real life money, which is awesome, it will make developers start developing for Roblox, sometimes there are people who abuse it so they make gamepasses of pointless stuff like, sprinting. I think some people will know what games I am talking about, but Jailbreak, you do not need to pay robux to sprint in jailbreak, Yeah, sometimes people do scam, bot, and hack your account, and this is why parents should be supervising their children,
1, Do not let your kids go to ""Free Robux"" games or website, it will hack you or even worse, scam you.
2, I would recommend letting your child talk to people until they are mature enough and know their internet safety, like don't give out information or don't give your password,
3, Make sure your child do not friend random people, that'll get them into a lot of trouble.
4, The only way to get robux is buying it, or people buying your clothes or a friend having some funds in it's group.","Adult"
"age 10+","Great game for education and fun, my 2 kids play it most of the time. It does has some kids on their doing weird things, and some mean stuff that is said to everyone but they simply ignore it, games like Clueless and Meepcity helpmy kids relax.

I showed my 4 kids and 2 of them loved it (girls) but my sons preferred ""fortnite"" But i will say that roblox tags out A LOT of stuff now. I think of this game fun and family friendly!!!!!!! And to cancel the account for some parents that want to just change her password and log out SO EASY! Bye hope you liked my review c:","Adult"
"age 11+","This game is NOT for kids. I believe that this game is very: Violent, Too much sex, too much swearing, and Safety and Privacy concers. Don't let your kids play this.","Adult"
"age 2+","BAsicly the bootleg version of Lego","Adult"
"age 5+","There is NO sex.
No matter what age you are, you are NOT allowed to curse.
The only violence is the deaths in ROBLOX and in any game's where it's the game's base.
There is no swearing due to ROBLOX's chat filter, but they took it a little too far (you can't even say numbers. why????). People have also been finding ways to bypass the chat filter by using ""f14k"" or ""S␉"".
I would not say there is too much swearing, though. Most parents get this game's idea wrong, and they always see their children playing the wrong games as well. Many people would say there's too much communism but don't remember that ROBLOX is just a video game company, like every other one: that's goal is to give people a fun experience and get their share of money in the process. Some kids really like ROBLOX so it seems the should stop playing stuff like Phantom Forces on their extremely-noticeable living-room-placed 2-feet-tall 3-foot-wide computer, and instead secretly on their 2-foot-tall 3-foot-wide in-gramma's-house-and-room computer, or laptop.
This is a great game, 5 stars to the CHEF!!!","Adult"
"age 2+","The community is really salty and toxic. People are rude and call people out for being ""Noobs"". Roblox is basically a cartoon, and is extremely unrealistic.

"age 18+","Price for builder's club or Robux isn't worth the money. Lots of bullies, cursing, and people that make Roblox not fun to play. Though this is rare but there games with pornographic content, online dating and tons of other stuff that violate Roblox's Terms of Service rules. Yet if you report people this is what happens: nothing, and in rare cases, you get banned/terminated for ""Violating Terms of Service"". I played Roblox to experience it myself and it was ATROCIOUSLY TERRIBLE. Even with the chat filter, there are people who can bypass the filter and still curse, it also filters inoffensive words and numbers. And that's not all there are also scams that say ""Go to this website ""Sampletext.com"" for free Robux"". The Online dating thing needs to stop NOW! To all parents whose children play Roblox out there UNINSTALL ROBLOX RIGHT AFTER READING THIS. You parents don't want child predators or Pedophiles targeting your children. Like I said before UNINSTALL ROBLOX AFTER READING THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT SOMETHING LIKE WHAT I SAID TO HAPPEN! Besides minecraft is WAY better than ROBLOX.

"age 14+","You need to understand what Roblox is. Roblox is a community based game where the community make the playable games that the users are capable of playing. The majority of ""front page games"", otherwise known has the most popular are directed at the younger audience. But this only scratches the surface. Most games revolve around mature content and hard-to-understand aspects of gameplay. As it is a community built game, kids will make worst content and some will make great content. It depends on what your child thinks about.
I'm not saying Roblox has a toxic community, they do. It's filled with bullies and racists, but that is why I suggest you to be 14 years of age or higher to play because you need to learn how to cope with people.
In all forms of social media, this happens everywhere, sexting conversations, bullying on comment sections, etc. Humans are just like that, you can't blame the game, it's the users.
Roblox do indeed follow reports, but it takes them time. They have a small moderation team and around 5,000,000 active users. +-
Roblox is not for kids. Roblox tries to censor bad words, but their filter system is terrible, so it doesn't only censor bad words, it censors half of the Vocabulary. I can't manage to even type out a number in most cases. I've noticed the system censor the word ""Well"" as of late.

"age 4+","This game is a great game! I own the account badcc and i make a living off of it. These parents have no idea what they are talking about. Yes, there is an amazing filter (it gets annoying sometimes) and yes, there are ways to bypass it. The chat filter is barely ever bypassed, and if it is then block your child's chat feature in settings. So that is complaint #1 solved. Now exploiters (which are for some reason referred to as ""hackers"") exploiters can only ""hack"" games that arent filtering enabled (which all of the games on the front page are fe) Dont allow your child to give their password to a ""free robux"" game on the front page (they use bots to get up there) Lastly, sexual predators. Now, this is brought up millions of times, there is a .001% chance you will ever encounter one. The people that are sending those chats are trolls. Not sexual predators! Just block your child's chat. Roblox is a great platform for making and playing games with friends (which i have 5 in real life that i met on roblox) with the endless character customization (if you buy robux, it's worth it) and seasonal events, your kid will never stop playing. Because of Roblox, i make 530,000 dollars every year just by making games and clothes!

"age 18+","I myself wemt on this game, because my son had it on the ipad. When i learned it had online chat, I was not happy with the inability to turn chat off. The chat was rolling in the top corner of the screen, like a chat room - even though players weren’t talking to me specifically, I was forced to have their chat on my screen. I did not actually see any normal kid-chat activity; it seemed like older teenagers and up - cussing, talking about sex, and calling each other names. I took the app off of the ipad and told the kids that there are a LOT of good games to play out there, but this is NOT one of them. There are no words filtered, no one gets in trouble/kicked off for using them, and other parents who are friends of mine actually saw people simulating sex acts on there. THIS IS AN APP FOR PREDATORS. Get another game and keep your kids safe.","Adult"
"age 14+","Roblox is an addictive and fun game, I played ROBLOX for 11 years now and still play today, even though it seems to be broken down today. So, I don't call the Roblox platform innapropriate itself, it depends fmore on the games which are made by players. Let's take the example ""MeepCity"", a game which is made to be very kid-friendly so it also is mainly played by kids, in games like these you might should not have to worry about your kid being exposed to swearing, sex and other innapropriate stuff too much. Even though you parents should sometimes throw an eye on the screen. Sadly there also are not too kid-friendly games, like a very ""unsocial"" game called ""The streets"", where swearing is very common, it is mainly played by older teens and even a lot of adults. Even though there exists a setting for &lt;13 accounts, which blocks innapropriate games for kids, there are still a lot of other games which are not checked by Roblox, so your kids can easily join them. You should also be aware that players can easily estimate the age of other players by their way to move their character, way they talk, reactions, and avatar look. So all in one I would say that Roblox has a very poor moderation system which is easy to bypass. Maybe you have heard of a kid's Roblox avatar getting raped on a playground, making trouble in the internet and more stuff. So what I wanna say is, that it will not be the only time that that will happen. It has happened over 20 times to my Roblox avatar, it can almost be called something very common when you are a Roblox veteran, saying something like ""wow"" or even laughing about it. So, I would suggest that you would let your kid only play games which is mainly played by other kids, so the safety is higher. Set the real kid's age at the account creation. And always have an eye on the kid playing.","Adult"

"age 5+","Parents, parents... Listen to me, please.
I have some things to explain why Roblox isn't bad.
1 - The chat
Although you see hashtags, such as ####, it is NOT a swear word. I repeat, it is not. That is Roblox's filter. The filter is quite sensitive if you have even bothered played Roblox for once. If you don't believe me, search it up and see what the others say.
2 - The players
Yes there are a few bad apples out there, but you can BLOCK them. If you don't like that specific player, just block them. Click their name in the player list, and click block.
3 - Places
There are some horrible places, but if you feel SOOOOO insecure about your child, then watch them play.
Also, Roblox is educational too. There is something called Roblox Studio. If your child is looking forward to become a game developer, then introduce them to it! Your child could learn coding, building online, and many things! Trust me, I've been playing for 4-5 years and I've learned quite some things from this game.
You should give this game a try for yourself.","Adult"

"age 8+","Hello, I’m a kid, okay?
- Roblox is a social online-game, you can create your own games with IT Knowlge, and you can play games maded by another player.
- That was maded in 2004 (But in test version)
- Roblox was launched officialy and public in 2006, it’ s good until 2015-2016
- From 2016 up is one problem with Roblox:
-daters
-scammers (It is a automated account maded by a hacker, if you use the link that they said, your computer will be virused!)
- kids that swear your kids
- And many other things

"age 10+","Hi, I've had roblox since I was 10, the game is great for kids and teens. I have seen parents get mad over the in-game chatting and the messages sent to your child, you can easily disable in-game chatting and messaging. Just go to settings and go under privacy, you can disable in-game chat so your child and other players cannot speak to one another. You can also disable messaging under the privacy settings so no creeps / bullies / etc can message your kids. I wouldn't take this game away from your kids because of a few idiotic kids on the game, just simply disable all chats and add restrictions if your child is too young and you want to prevent online communications. Hope this helps!","Adult"

"age 13+","ROBLOX is a game about your imagination, but it is very limited. Only about 40 or so items are free, although many are made each year, and many usernames are taken. Roblox has many issues, the moderating system doesnt work, so reporting a player doesnt work.
Roblox has very big issues with account theft, hacking, and Online Dating. ODing (as the community calls it) is the worst issue on roblox because it could easily lead to sexual interaction. Tell your child to avoid players with ""thick thighs"" or ""Bear mask"" or ""ice arms/legs"" because those players are trying to date on a kids app. Players are easily able to bypass swearing such as ""fxkc"" or ""neegah"" by simply spelling it wrong. The game can get bloody but there really isnt that much gore involved. Almost every item for your avatar costs ROBUX, you need to spend real money for robux, and the prices are very unfair. I would say a teenager would fit more into this app, because they would know internet safety, and wouldnt care as much about their avatar as a young boy or girl would. Only a few players on roblox are actually kind and show respect, but a good chunk of the community are mean, anti-social or just flat out rude.
Overall, dont let your kid play this, wait until they get older.","Adult"

and more. I have also seen naked characters. We have also seen things in the chat like “hey bae get in bed” or something STUPID like that. Have fun, but be careful.","Parent of a 11 and 14-year-old"
"age 8+","I think that this game is a very good game.
The news articles always tell lies about the game. Yes, you may get the occasional person who tries to 'date you' but so what, doesn't make them a predator. It's normally just some kid who gets bored with the games on the platform so tries to make a friend or just wants some company. Most people who try to 'date' doesn't even mean anything by it. And if they do try doing something 'weird' It's normally their excessive use of YouTube or what their parents have done bringing them up. It's not predators you should worry about it's what you teach your kids and what they do online with what you've caused them to do. There's almost no predators on this game, but what online game doesn't have predators anyway? There's always going to be that 1% like any other online game, you can't expect it to always be 100% clean. The news will report on whatever they can get their hands on, so don't believe the stupid articles. Someone could've just wrote something fake and put it in the news for a bit of dosh. ROBLOX is clean from my experience on it. And I've been on it since 2011 when there was barely any Online Daters.
If you really worry about weird things online then just don't let your child even go on YouTube, Xbox, Playstation, Club Penguin Island, Moshi Monsters (If that's still relevant), Bin Weevils, ect. Because all of them basically are the same in their own ways with the chat system. Don't blame the games, blame the parents who let their child mess around on the darker sides of YouTube or wherever they learn the weird stuff they do on these online games.","Adult"
"age 10+","Hi I have been on roblox for 9 years and I highly recommended this for kids. Why because it has so much to do you can play games with your friends from school or make a rocket ship on studio. And teenagers can even be paid to make games by using the developer exchange program it may have a little too much consumerism but that is to make roblox safe for kids of all ages. Now they only have a moderation team of 17 so it’s hard for them to read reports and moderate everything but they have enough bots on the site so it’s almost impossible to do anything 18+. THat is why I highly recommend roblox","Adult"
"age 13+","My 10 year old son really enjoyed playing Roblox with his friends. He even saved his allowance and birthday money (over one year and $100) to spend on the site. Then one day he came home from school and logged in only to find his account had been deleted with the message, “Don’t create accounts just to harass players and break rules.” This was a shock to him. Neither of us could figure out how or why this happened. Was his account hacked? I immediately filed an appeal and asked for proof that my son had violated their rules. (I knew they would have none). The moderator said he wouldn’t tell me what happened because my email wasn’t verified, but I had created the account and entered my email myself. Because the account had been deleted there was no way for me to prove anything or figure out what happened. The moderator was extremely curt and offered no assistance whatsoever. In the end my son was heartbroken and lost not only his money but the connection he had with his classmates who continued to play without him. Had I known the customer support was this awful I would never have let my son sign up let alone spend his hard earned money on the site.","Adult"

"age 13+","ROBLOX simply isn't what the media portrays it to be. As you know, the media usually is biased, with things left out and such.
The parents who did publish those articles were simply just uneducated, and never should've let their 8-12 year old children play those games in the first place, and they are the ones completely at fault. Those ""child predators"" are 12 year old children trying to get some on an online game, and a couple of clicks to block them should be fine. Or, if you want to have total safety, disable every social setting for them.
About the community. If you are someone like me who has playing ROBLOX since the early days, you know that the community has taken a drastic decline. The website (mostly aimed at 8-10 year olds) faces lots of censorship, and most people do complain about this and make petitions about it. This correlates to my 2nd paragraph, describing those articles about child predators. ROBLOX needed to improve their image on the media, so they had to rule with an iron fist in terms of censorship. Most of the community does not speak, doesn't play the games correctly, and they just don't use common sense anymore.
About the game-making aspect, the engine really has improved since I started playing in 2011. The rendering and physics has gotten better, and there is more capacity for things that simply just don't look like ROBLOX.

Yesterday, my daughter's account was banned for 7 days claiming she had made unauthorized charges. I contacted them enquiring. Turns out when she bought some Robux last week at my parents, the computer was logged into a family friends Paypal account. His account was charged and he contact Paypal about it. They filed the charges as unauthorized. Without even contacting US, the PARENTS, Roblox opted to automatically close her account without giving anybody a chance to explain.
My Family friend contacted Roblox AND paypal and explained it was an accidental charge and he was not worried about it and did not want her Roblox account to be closed as we had STUPIDLY dumped money into A VIDEO GAME...
Roblox didn't give a crap, they closed the account anyways and I am now out money because they can't remotely contact the account owner for an explanation or even to try to come to settle any of this. Maybe if they contacted me, It would have been explained this was all an accident and was intended to come out of MY ACCOUNT...

She told me she loved me *im a girl btw* and wanted to kiss me. This was on my safe chat account but she used symbols and spaced letters out to bypass these filters.

Half the community is oders, people who think they're cool, and bully others, trollers, just jerks in general, and the other half is just scammers. Another thing is the rude language and some people blacklisting through the chat filters, which isn't that bad but the rude language could be fixed. The thing is you CAN'T because roblox doesn't even read their reports. I've been a roblox member for just about 10 years, and I am not pleased with how it has turned out. Honestly, the games on roblox aren't that bad unless you look up inappropriate stuff in the games category. I also really like the items in the catalog, ignoring the fact you need robux and bc for EVERYTHING in there besides 99.8% of the so called ""noob"" stuff. One thing I have a problem is the scammers. They try to steal your account by telling you to go to some website to get free robux. And it's spammed throughout EVERY comment section I see! I wish roblox would start looking through item comment sections and at least try to delete some! And I have seen mods and admins online roblox to at least delete a few scammers down there.

However the amount of vulgar language I see and references that are used by other kids is completely unacceptable. And unfortunately reporting doesn't do anything and these moderators (at least the ones I've dealt with) were prejudice and banned me for no reason. So there was someone who was ranting about their political beliefs, and personally I don't think stuff like that belongs in a kids game for other children to see and be exposed to. I tried to politely tell the person that they shouldn't be discussing these topics on here, and later that evening I was banned for 3 days for ""hate speech"". When I tried to appeal the ban, the moderator told me that I WAS THE ONE AT FAULT here and that what I did was supressing the other person. But like I said, there are just certain political and controversial topics that kids shouldn't be exposed to at a young age. Aside from that issue, there are a lot of instances where kids are recreating sexual acts. For all we know there could be child predators posing as kids, and if you are a parent who's reading this, please make sure your child is using a 12 you and under account, which has increased privacy and will protect your child from this garbage, but overall, it's just best if you didn't let your child play Roblox.

Also, back in 2016 ROBLOX removed tix and tix was the only way to get free robux. And since they have removed tix, there have been numerous games that have a gravestone of tix in it because roblox had removed tix and I believe this is so that people can’t get anymore free robux and are greedy in money for people buy robux, and I am not buying any robux.
Moving on into roblox studio, and its configuring page. I believe roblox studio has improved from my last review on Roblox. But I have one problem. I want to keep my interface the same as always but it will always come back. If Roblox can improve this, then I will make another review on RBLX Studio being improved. Now for the configuring page, I have just one problem... WHY DO YOU FILTER MY TEXT. THERE IS NO CURSING IN THE TEXT, NO PERSONAL INFORMATION AND NOTHING INAPPROPRIATE.
So in conclusion, Roblox can be fun in all BUT IT HAS PROBLEMS. By the way, I am not an adult and it says so for some reason.","Parent of a 11-year-old"
"age 12+","I loved this game, and if your kid is asking to get it, I would get it for them. It's an amazing game with lots of fun minigames inside. But beng honest, do be aware that the game currency, ""robux"" is only available with real money. Your kid might be nagging you to buy them robux. Also, there are a lot of people who are not kids, hacking the game and saying bad words. But, the moderation of roblox is extremely good. For example, if you tried to say something bad, it would turn the word to hashtags : ######
It even hashtags out numbers, so kids can't giver out their age. All of this in conclusion does mean there is a free for all global chat in game that anyone can speak on. Maybe read up on some more reveiews about this game before downloading it for your child! Hope I helped everyone, feel free to ask me any more questions, I'm quite an expert on this game. Thanks, bye!
P.S There are also some violent game where you shoot people and some blood appears. But, if you go to roblox.com you will be able to create them an account there and block the games that you don't want your kid clicking play on.

Let me say my rating, It's a good website to play on, Many games are fun to play on, and the avatar editor is clean and the website itself, Part of the community is good. and Do I recommenced this, before I say my answer.. hear what i am saying.
Roblox isn't a bad website, but isn't a good website, While in game remember this... It is common to meet exploiters, trolls, and hackers. and Some places/games in Roblox will be inappropriate for your kids in some way and some games will be inappropriate in ways you wouldn't think your child would see.(Note: The Place will get banned after numerous reports about the place is headed to them) and The Community has bad parts, I did say it's good but only some parts. and Roblox during 2013 used to be free, and Yes, Their was monetization but it uses to be an option, but now, if see a roblox game that is good (BLOXBURG) you have to pay for it, and the youtube community about this website is horrible but many channels are good about roblox like Epikrika, KonokeKitten, MrObviou.... Ah.. Never Mind that..............
Also Remember there is no way of getting free robux
So is it a good website and my saying is Yes but remember this, You will see in a common day on ROBLOX, hackers,trolls, bad parts of the community like toxic people, Free Robux &lt;-(even though it's not real and it's false) and if you're a child playing the game, Make sure you be with your parent while playing a game in case, some thing bad happens...

"age 7+","I feel that this game is for all ages, however, it is strongly recomended to keep chat disabled (which is done automatically if the specified age when making the account is under 13 years old. If I remember correctly, it is still unobtainable without activation on the parent or guardian's email address.
Roblox is a fun and unique game, however it is losing the building blocks vibe it once held dear, however you may inspire your children to customize their avatar as a ""lego"" avatar. In more recent years, some girl avatars have fairly skimpy clothing, as clothing is mostly user generated, which is why I also think each parent/guardian should be the judge of what age is appropriate for this game.
Otherwise, it's a ton of fun and 100% safe with disabled chat. When chat is enabled, the 14-16 year olds tend to abuse it and speak nasty language by misspelling or using placeholder words to say adult/substance/voilent related topics. The Roblox moderation team is great, but they are also greatly outnumbered, so it's difficult to be perfect.","Adult"
"age 2+","This game is sooooo good you fellow adult should play this. 100000000000000000000000000000000/10, IGN apporved. Go play or die","Adult"
"age 10+","TL;DR at the very bottom.
Roblox is a sandbox platform available for the PC, Mac, iOS/Android devices and most recently, the Xbox One, in which it allows it's users to create games on the Roblox Studio application and share them with others on their website, and potentially make profit, similar to the Steam platform.
It's important to keep in mind that the recent controversies in the media regarding sexual assault and rape are caused by exploits, or ""hacks"" created by players that believe doing this is funny or cool, are not affiliated to the Roblox company, and can be seen at the bottom of this review.
Recently, Roblox has not been that great of a platform in the eyes of many. The site has changed quite a lot since it's good old days, but I am not here to express my nostalgia for the old site, instead, I am here to give my opinion on the topics listed below such as violence, sex, swearing, consumerism, and privacy concerns.
Violence:
Roblox has several genres of violent games such as first person shooters, murder, Russian roulette, horror, battle royale, zombies, heists, and if you are able to go deeper into the site, you can even find torture and suicide games on the site. Guns and weapons are for the most part simple, but Roblox allows 3D models from 3rd party applications or sites to be exported to Roblox Studio, which can vary by game. Blood can be a plain red color, or have an added texture, which again, can vary by game.
Sex:
Although you cannot find this genre of games particularly normally, there are several games that have been infested with such terrible content, but have been taken down. Content like this come in the form of exploits (as mentioned earlier in the review) which are not related to the Roblox company. There are also online communities that are dedicated to making Roblox pornography, which again, none of this content comes from Roblox themselves and these people are not affiliated with the company.
Inappropriate Language:
Roblox introduced a “White List” system in 2013 which allows all players under the age of 13 to chat in-game with a list of words users can say instead of the “Black List” set for players over 13 with a list of words users can’t say. As you can see in many other reviews, the lists have been abused to the point where you can no longer use certain letters, words or numbers due to them sounding similar to inappropriate words. These lists can often be bypassed by adding in additional symbols or letters, or removing letters or symbols out of words. Until there is a change in the way words can be said, you will see a person speaking in hashtags (#’s) or see them bypassing the lists.
Consumerism:
Roblox allows users to purchase in-game currency called ""Robux"". It can be purchased on their website, mobile applications and the Microsoft Store with prices varying from 0.99$ to 200.00$ USD. Membership is also available for purchase, monthly or yearly called ""Builders Club"" with prices from 5.99$ to 129.99$ USD. Players are often required to make such purchases to customize their character with clothing or items from the Catalog page.
Safety and Privacy:
As of lately, there are multiple games promoting “FREE ROBUX”, or free in-game currency. No player should join any of the websites that are being promoted, as again, none of these website are directly affiliated or sponsored by the Roblox company in any way. If you input your password in any of these games/websites, you run the risk of having your current currency spent or transferred, your e-mail and password being changed or have your account banned doing something you did not do.
Summary:
Several websites may rate this game for ages 10+, it’s important to note that this does not reflect the entire site. This game contains content in which you may not feel comfortable viewing or have your child viewing. You can have fun, create games, and make friends. Just make sure as a parent/guardian you observe your child at all times. Here's how to enable account restrictions on a child's account: https://blog.roblox.com/2017/03/keeping-community-safe/

How is that for a username in a kids game. Roblox targets kids and completely lacks moderation. This company is disgusting.
There is games you can even play due the the bullying and harrassment. Roblox should be SUED for targeting our children, cause they absolute lack of moderation subjects our kids to porn!","Adult"

"age 14+","If you decide to let your kids play Roblox the parent should set up the account.
Roblox support is virtually non-existent for parents.
I had issues with Roblox and my kids and needed to resolve a few things. As a parent without an account I had no way to contact Roblox.
I used my LinkedIn to email the CEO directly.","Adult"
"age 13+","I think that Roblox is an alright game but I would moderate on what your children are doing on it. There is a lot of sexual content and mean players in it who get triggered if you say the wrong thing or wear a shirt with something that they don't like on it. Every player on the game is very judgmental and competitive with one another. Also, the game is very addictive and you could be on it for hours without knowing. Many of the children on the game dress inappropriately and the parents of the child's account don't know that online they are acting like a completely different person who has sex virtually at such a young age or talks and dates strangers who they don't even know. I'd recommend this game to a parent who wants to moderate and watch every move their child makes because there are many pedophiles and perverts on the game. It also makes your child learn about bad things at such a young age and I learned this through experience because I've been playing it since 2013. Also, robux and builders club these days is such a waste of money and I wouldn't recommend spending a penny because in a year your child will eventually quit the game. As a matter of fact, in my last five years I've learned that you can get banned easily for doing things that didn't even violate anything. But the point is, moderate and don't let a child under the age of 10 play this game and if you do make sure to moderate.","Adult"

"age 10+","Roblox is meant for all ages, but 10 to 18 is what I would say is the best. (besides counting those famous Roblox developers, those are ages 18 to 26.) Roblox alone is a really good game, which others can express their minds on creating and building, with unlimited imagination. Roblox has no swear words, but sadly, some other players think otherwise to that. Other adult reviews are making reviews about other players being older and try to get past the filter system saying profanity, or even hacking the chat system. This has NOTHING to do with Roblox, but I would say ROBLOX needs to actually be more strict with them instead of not reading report reviews most of the time.If a parent is reading this, PLEASE tell you child the following: 1. do NOT give any private information, including the least concern, which is age. 2. do NOT fall for the ""free robux"" scams, as this will take any robux on your account, or even take your account itself. (if this happens, contact Roblox immediately. even put a parent's email after or before you get scammed, just for proof that it is your parent contacting Roblox if happens in the future.) 3. leave games quickly if something looks odd in the game such as deleted parts, different images, etc. this means the game got hacked by a hacker, or maybe the hacker is still even in the game. 4. make good decisions, do not play role playing games with strangers. those strangers may be hackers or may be above 18 years of age. play with only their good, loyal friends. 5. strangers online come together to make friends with others. they can play games with them, or become friends with them, but just know if they seem fishy, avoid them. ROBLOX does ban players that don't follow the terms of services, so don't worry about that. If one sees another doing something inappropriate or whatnot, you can even report them, but this is optional. As always, STAY SAFE! -2012 Roblox Player, EpicThunder231.","Adult"
"age 12+","Love the game BUT it's way too easy to buy robux on xbox/console. I'm sending a message to other kids, please listen.It's too easy to forget that robux cost REAL money and will get billed to the card on file (aka your parents).
Take it from me, I did it and I lost my mom's trust. The first time I did it, I racked up $400+ dollars in charges, and even that wasn't enough to stop me because the game is so addictive and the most fun way to play requires that you buy robux. I even snuck down in the middle of the night to play.
I take responsibility for my actions, but the game developers know kids can and want robux, and they should make it harder to get. I'm only 12 and I figured out how to be sneaky and figured out how to get past the parental controls.
4 months later I still haven't paid my mom back for all the charges and I still don't have my xbox back. But the worst part is that I lost and still haven't earned her trust back which makes me feel lousy.It wasn't worth it, take it from me .","Adult"
"age 10+","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","Adult"
"age 13+","I will begin by fairly acknowledging the positive aspects of Roblox. It is a diverse and enjoyable application offering users an opportunity to create their own games and clothing, and to explore the creations of other players. This is part of what makes it fun and unique, but also what makes it dangerous for children and teens.
It is a fact widely acknowledged by long-time players that, over the years, Roblox has slowly evolved from an outlet for creativity into an exploitative, poorly-moderated, cash-grabbing heap of rubbish. Although accounts and (most) games are “free,” gameplay is made considerably easier through the purchase of robux, the in-game currency that costs real money. Unfortunately, players who do not purchase robux are frequently harassed by other players and denounced as “noobs.” In many cases, the games themselves are spammed with shop links and game passes which encourage the player to spend robux for useless upgrades. Most clothing on the app is also paid, sometimes listed for thousands of robux.
My greatest concern, however, is with the poorly-moderated and negligent administration. On Roblox, users can purchase Nazi uniforms, or similarly inappropriate user-generated attire, with no consequence. The profanity filter is commonly and easily bypassed by users, so your child may witness excessive profanity, sexting, and similar vulgarities both in-game and in private chat. My niece and nephew, for instance, have each been solicited by random perverts on roleplaying games.
From my experience, Roblox’s profanity filter mirrors the current state of the app itself; it is unnecessarily strict for many harmless words, while ignoring the real problems. There is a moderation system in place, but it is poorly managed, to say the least. Many reports go unnoticed, so many offences go unpunished. I have reported bullying, profanity, sexual “online dating,” and hate speech on numerous occasions — most were ignored. I have reported hate groups affiliated with Nazism and white supremacy — all were ignored. I have reported users with inappropriate profiles (including, in one instance, Nazi propaganda and a “Heil Hitler”) — and all were ignored. I have reported well-known sexually-based games and popular hangouts which allow uncensored music — and all were ignored.
If you want my honest opinion: yes, Roblox CAN be fun and positive, but it is ruined by rampant corruption, consumerism, inadequate moderation, and horribly inappropriate content. I have deleted my account, and I strongly advise you to do the same.","Parent"
"age 9+","..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................","Adult"
"age 18+","It appears Roblox has been having issues with filtering content, and users have made a game if subverting those filters, posting violent or sexual content and using substitute swear words. You should keep children offline with Roblox, or simply not use it, because Roblox is not enforcing kid safe policies well.

"age 14+","This game should not be for kids specially under 12. Too much violence, kids will learn less positivity but more negativity from this game. We should not allow to play this game to kids.","Adult"
"age 13+","Although the characters and the gameplay has a Minecraft feel this platform is far from kid-friendly. Users are able to create their own games which are NOT moderated. I was horrified to find out some of the games my 8-year-old had been playing contained sexual content. Chat is available in the game and although players cannot type swear words, many players have found a way around this by replacing a letter with a special character. Also, be warned that complete strangers can message your kids directly. This game is a ticking time bomb and not safe for kids!","Parent"
"age 14+","My child was playing this game on an iPad. I was monitoring her while she was playing a game that was supposedly a girls and boys hangout. There was people referencing alcohol and drug usage and doing sex acts and using dirty language. I was not a fan and It is an addicting game as well. After she got into the game that's all she did and sometimes she would stop eating because she was into her game. Never ever ever play this game.","Adult"
"age 12+","We allowed our daughter (age 10) access to Roblox because the website claimed that communication could be limited to only people whose profiles were accepted as friends for kids under 13. THIS IS NOT TRUE AND IS VERY DECEPTIVE. Only private messaging is limited--communication with ANYONE playing the game is available at all times, just not private, leading to a much greater privacy risk than we had anticipated. While she enjoys the game, she has also experienced (to our dismay) her first online bullying due to this inability to control who interacts with her. (You can report people, but not unless you do it immediately when the event occurs and know their username, which is not always on display) .
Also, many of the games within Roblox are more violent than we had expected from a platform that markets itself for children. Some users are even attaching ""particles"" that blast audio bits or visual images that are sometimes pornographic. This is not allowed but it can happen before the game shuts it down.
Which brings me to my last issue: Our experience with Roblox customer service has been truly one of the worst I have ever seen. You cannot call to speak with someone directly; you have to call and leave a message for a callback, so I tried the email function. I exchanged multiple messages and each time got a reply from a different person, and even after six or seven replies from different people, there was no interest in helping with a relatively simple question--how to reset a lost password. They would not allow her to do this through the password reset button because we did not have a credit card on file, even when I offered to add one through customer service and to verify her account ownership by answering any questions they wanted to ask (list of friends, device IP, recent logins, etc). Now my daughter cannot ever log out of the game or she loses everything she has created in the game. I cannot believe that she is the only young child who has forgotten a password and does not have an open credit card attached to her account. When I pointed out that the question had not been answered even though I had politely asked each of the 6 or 7 people for help, I got the reply that ""we cannot help you with this issue."" Very disappointing. We feel a little scammed between the lack of actual security provided to the children's communication and the inability to provide a simple service like a password reset without a previously associated credit card.
Several of my mom friends and I agree that letting our kids have it is one of our biggest regrets in terms of parenting decisions. There are much better, equally fun games out there without the safety risks.","Adult"
"age 13+","Honestly as a person who actively plays Roblox I personally believe that if your child is under the age of 13 parents shouldn't allow their kids to play. It has people who act very idiotic and say inappropriate things or commit inappropriate actions. The Roblox censor system is very bad so alot of kids can replace or add letters to be able to say the word. For example, the word fuck, they could say ""fvck"" . Also, don't waste your money on the games currency also known as ""Robux""; it's a waste and the currency gets spent fast. So alot of money can get spent.","Adult"
"age 12+","I definitely think there are great things to this game, but there are many problems.. One is the influx of teenagers thinking that they're cool by attempting to bypass the swear filter (and succeeding). Not only that, it is too easy for kids to grab a credit card and spend all the money they want with little to no verification on purchases. There are also a few games on here that represent sexual acts (which ARE in fact usually removed, but not quick enough.) and games that involve a lot of weaponry and murder. While there are many innocent games, the violent ones definitely should make Roblox bump up their minimum age limit. Due to the variety of age differences within the Roblox community, personal info is easily spread around and abused, so I'd reccommend having the password to your child's account and montor everything said via Roblox messages and in-game chat.","Parent of a 9 and 13-year-old"

Firstly, their moderation system is trash. Secondly there is a history of online daters who date on roblox, in which they don't care about. If their so called ""Report Abuse"" button worked, then there would not be a petition to remove a single individual user on roblox. That user is DJMykal, the creator of Club Tesla on roblox. He has been exposed on youtube to be one of those unholy things. Yet, if you look him up on google, he is still here. Roblox obviously profits from things like this? When they have people who online date on roblox, those online daters will want to buy items inorder to look not so ""newbie"" or more attractive. This helps roblox profit. As a parent and guardian of two children who plays on Roblox, I highly recommend avoiding this game at all means. They will not handle your situation in time, professionally, and they will just read off their script on customer service. Their virtual items are too expensive and you might be scammed on that game by malicious users. From what I have heard, they also have the mannerism to terminate you in the most unfair way. Watch out parents! This game is anything but safe.
EDIT: Roblox will also side with these pedophiles. When you try to look their infamous online daters up on roblox. For example DJMykal, he will not appear on the search. Only a google search will find him. I have confirmed this with another user.","Adult"
"age 18+","We (my young son and I) started playing Roblox over a year ago, and at first, it was fun, and we even bought the Robux, and Builder's Club. But then we started to notice how the chat feature, and images in games started to turn vulgar and explicit. Even though Roblox supposedly hired more moderators, things are still vastly making it through. Reporting does not work, in essence, because they are apparently inundated with reports. And though some parent groups have volunteered to help in moderating for on-the-spot bans, they have been refused. The problem is persistent, and is not being resolved. This is, in my opinion, not a good game for any age, but definitely not for young kids. I would skip it.","Parent"
"age 18+","One day, my child asked me for permission to play this game called ""Roblox."" I checked it, and it seemed family friendly so I let him play. A few weeks later, he told me about a virtual currency and membership option called Robux and builders club. Being the amazing parent that I am, I bought $50 of in game items. This is my first problem; the prices are outrageous. I looked at some cosmetic items and in game items and saw how everything was way overpriced, but this is not my only complaint. My child began to talk and act differently; he began to swear and act violently toward me and others. I was afraid something happened at school but, no, it wasn't that. It was that game; it ruined my child. I looked into it and saw violent shooters and stuff that had KILLING AND MURDER. It doesn't madder if blood looked like it was from a N.E.S game with the same concept. We being believers in God, I immediately spanked my child for being so disrespectful and restricted his use of the computer, and if he did need it i would need to be supervising.","Adult"
"age 8+","ROBLOX is an amazing game that allows young players all over the world to communicate and create together. There is a variety of amazing games to choose from. But monitor what people say in the chat. You can change your settings to make it safer, or you can just close it. Otherwise, it's a harmless game made for all ages, even though I would recommend people over eight.","Adult"
"age 9+","Hey, i'm Matteo and I play roblox as a twelve year old. Sorry it says i'm and adult, I honestly don't know how to change it. Don't think that i'm saying Roblox is good because I play, only because this is simply my opinion. So in ROBLOX you get to do many things- play games made by others users (Don't worry, ROBLOX shuts down any inappropriate games and bans or warns the user that made the game), buy Limited/Limited U items and trade, make games, and make friends. Now, of course all parents worry about that ""Make friends"" part. In my opinion, as long as your child knows not to give out any private info, it's fine to make friends. Like right now I currently have 11 friends, and 7 are in real life and 4 online.
I do warn parents and families that the community isn't the best. It is full of online daters. But here is some simple advice. Stay away from roleplaying games like ""Boy And Girls Dance Club"" or ""Robloxian High School. If you stay away from those games, you'll have a fun time.
Currency- The virtual currency in ROBLOX is what us Robloxians call Robux. The smallest package is 0.99 USD for 80 robux, biggest being 200 USD for 22,250 robux. There is also ""Builders Club"" which is 6.99. If you get robux, I recommend buying Builders CLub first if it's in your budget, as 22,250 robux goes up to 35,000 robux at the same price of 200 USD, and the other robux packages go up aswell.
And for parents overreacting calling us ""toxic players"" we are far from that.
I hope you guys found this helpful.
Sincerely, Matteo (A.K.A D_dge)","Adult"

"age 18+","This game hosts a toxic player base, violent games, and is a money trap. The kids use the chat to talk inappropriately and can be very mean to each other. There is quite a bit of cyber bulling and it can be difficult for kids (even ones that have been educated about internet safety) to avoid getting roped into doing unsafe things or giving out identifying information.
Once an account is created, it can never be deleted, even if it was made without parental consent. The game states that it will always keep your account so it'll be ready for you to play on when you come back to it. I think that this is a bad thing though, because the child will be tempted to sneak back on and play without permission.
Since I couldn't delete the account that was made without parental permission, I got on it and changed the password, username, and avatar, and removed everyone on the account's friend list because it was the closest I could get to deleting it.
I highly recommend not letting your children play Roblox as it is unsafe, is a potential breeding ground for predators, is highly addictive for young kids, and is like a virus because you can't get rid of it.","Adult"
"age 8+","Theres scamming, bribing, Pornography in the worse case but this is no fault to roblox its the games poor design that people are exploiting on kids! Theres a way to fix this though as long as your kid is registered under 13 they will have safe chat. The games I found out that where the most unsafe where RPG Roleplays or what they call RP. Avoid games that are cartoonish as these are uselly the most dangerous ones. And here are some stuff they say that you dont know is bad but for a kid it's my knowledge. ""Want free robux? or Want this gamepass free?"" This is a scam tool and is trying to trick you to taking a survey for their own profit. Also another is FCU this means ""Fuck You"" and is uselly unseen by parents as of its spelling. Either way as long as you review the games and check theirs no way you can avoid them. Alternativly you can get you and your kids friends to join a private server. This is where the kid needs to invite there friends to play with them. Unfortunatlly this cost the games in game currency ""Robux"" but if you join small lobbys your kid should be safe.

"age 16+","Hello.
Though I am not an adult, this is my perspective of Roblox.
I was probably one day looking for Minecraft online, and I found this.
I started off playing simple games, and I found I was happy here. There were also teletubby games, also good. However, one day at school the violin teacher was ill. You would've thought I did violin like everyone else. Nope, I played Roblox. However, Mother got a bit angry when she heard the news.
Once, I found a replica of Super Mario 64 on the atrocity. Amazed, I played and played. However, once the creator said he would quit. ""But,"" I thought to myself, ""he never completed it."" I decided that I would quit. Aaaand then he came back. So did I. However, one day, on Lion Roleplay there were curses. If one Robloxian however, says a swear word in its true form it will be ""#n"" n id the number of letters in the curse word. However, they COULD say sheet for ""***t"" and faq for ""f***"". So, I spied on my brother's behaviour on Roblox being suspicous after that. However, my older brother deleted my footage. Father had seen it though.
But there is more on Roblox.
First, ADDICTION. It isn't recorded how much a child spends on Roblox daily, but I tell you, they will choose it over school, outings, dinner, homework, excersise, et cetera. Also, RAGE AND SCAM OF MONEY. The money of Roblox can cost over $100 with $4.95 at the minimum. Children will either beg for your money, or beg for more chore wages. However, there is or was the donate feature. This allows Robloxians to give their Robux to other ones. However, the recipient of this well earnt cash may leave and might be the richest player there is, and leaves the sender in rage.
Then we get SILENT REPORTS. Robloxian sends report. Does R. HQ do anything? Nope.
Also, games with GUNS AND BOMBS. These games involve destroying iconic cartoon characters.
Finally, RIGGED AWARDS, SEMI-RACISM AND MISTREATMENT.
The Unofficial Bloxy Awards are given to people who seem to do tasks better than the rest. Although, once someone nominated for BEST LIVESTREAMER doesn't stream at all. Also, tiny channels nominated being the best?! Come on!
Although skin colour may not be a concern, people will call some ""bacon-hairs"". This is the default hair.
Last but not least, MISTREATMENT.
There is evidence that R. HQ is not against this AT ALL. In real life, a ""noob"" is someone new to a topic, especially in virtual matters. However, a Roblox Noob is a regular Roblox avatar with yellow skin and head, green legs and blue torso. Also, R. HQ might be FOR this. HOW? Once, there was an item called Tix, probably to be tickets that would cost Robux. However, since this was free, naturally, money hog David Baszucki removed it.
If you are someone intending to block Robux, please do! This shows you care for your children.

"age 15+","Whell, Roblox is a good game, but however there is some swearing on the game, but some of it is sencored by a #. Even though people have found ways to swear on the game. So i dont reccomend you getting Roblox for your children. Buy Minecraft.","Parent"
"age 16+","Though, i've personally moved on from ROBLOX, I gave my account to a little brother of mine.
Now, usually, ROBLOX would be top-notch when it comes to moderation, though can sometimes be a little strict. Other than that, they were reliable back in 2013. Since a game called 'Meepcity' was released, my brother was playing it constantly. I never actually paid attention to it, since you know, ROBLOX was pretty reliable when it comes to moderation. Now, yesterday, I caught him inside a home, apparently getting a 'Lapdance'. I confronted him about the dangers of what he called 'ODing', and I took back the account by force, and told him to never play the game again. My little brother is 12, and it's kinda shocking on how much information ROBLOX can feed my little brother.
This convinced me to temporarily go into my older alternative account from 2011 to see what is actually up with ROBLOX, today, by going into one of the games called ""The Streets"". So far, i've been constantly harassed, and even been 'cursed out', sometimes even called 'Bad'. Not to mention that the game is filled to the brim with exploiters. It is not a joke, ROBLOX actually changed, from a redesign to even the community becoming a toxic wasteland.
ROBLOX's moderation team will barely do jack-shoot about Online Dating, or even put out punishments for these so-called rules that they want you to follow. I understand that moderation is hard, but come on! It shouldn't be THAT hard to monitor a simple chat, than ban them. ROBLOX's moderation isn't the worst thing ever. The worst thing, besides the community and the moderation is the consumerism. Oh my god.
ROBLOX back in the day used to give others without a membership a chance to profit. From making shirts, t-shirts, to even making games, and coding games, so that you can learn to become a successful game developer. Which is always useful, and helpful towards the younger audience, but now you basically have to PAY to actually make money. If you're planning on making money without paying actual money, I suggest giving up, cause there is practically NO WAY to make money, without being forced to go into your wallet, especially when Tix got removed.
Overall, this site has went downhill, and turned into a completely, toxic community that is not safe for your children. I would usually say 'Do whatever your heart desires', but this is an order:
STAY AWAY FROM THAT SITE.","Adult"
"age 7+","Roblox is totally fine for children, as long as you monitor their activity. Roblox also goes to great lengths to improve their privacy settings and child protection, so words filter out into a line of #####. Numbers are also banned, and children 12 and under have extra settings to keep them safe. Bad things may happen ONLY if you don't monitor their actions time to time. I think it was in the UAE, children got into trouble with roblox when their parents didn't monitor them, but children had a fun time when their parents checked up on them.

"age 13+","This game is good for having fun, playing games, and exploring. There is more bad that eats away the good. Kids who play this game can lead others to give away personal infomation. There is something where the game uses the pound “#” to block out bad talk. Players have gotten away with that and can space words out like instead of “bad” they can say “ba d”. The words can be very immature and they need to find a solution to this issue. Kids can also be very rude. A few games can be fairly violent and horrifying to kids.","Adult"

"age 8+","My kids love Roblox. For a few years, they spent much of their chore earnings on in-game purchases in it. Then Roblox abruptly terminated their accounts and seized all their purchases because our credit card company erroneously initiated some chargebacks. We had the card undo that as quickly as we could, and tried to explain to Roblox. They didn't care, and even planned to keep $100s in pre-payment on yearly subscriptions with no refund. I posted a nasty review on the BBB site and then they reinstated my kids accounts. However, they still confiscated some of their purchases to ""compensate"" for the error the card company wouldn't rectify for a few weeks. Just think how you explain to your kids how their purchases with chore money can just be taken away like this through no fault of their own. I suggest you just don't let them get started and don't financially support this reprehensible company.","Parent"

"age 10+","ROBLOX is a Massive online game designed for kids to build games and play other peoples games, every game on Roblox was built by another player the most popular games are on the front page of the site.
This also encourages them to learn to program what can be very beneficial for them in their adult life!
I personally have never found any ""pedophiles"" on the site, all this online dating is mainly 10 year olds who go too far in roleplay and are simply kids either trolling or having a laugh, the site has taken countless measures to protect children such as having a 24/7 moderation team who read reports and moderate any images in the site that may be inappropriate.
The Cost,
Like all games Roblox costs money it's free to play however the site has a currency called Robux that costs an arm and a leg! PRO TIP: Robux is expensive on the official website however is really cheap on a site called rbx.place so if your kids are Interested in robux get it there theres also membership options too.","Adult"
"age 18+","My son started playing this game 2 years ago. I thought it seemed pretty innocent at first, but then he started getting nerve-racking messages! Some of them I do not believe are appropriate enough to repeat on this kid-friendy website. I told him not to talk to people on Roblocks, but he didn't listen to me. I grounded him from this game for 2 weeks, and I took away his Leapfrog Epic Academy. I instructed him to stop playing Roblocks after this. However, on his 9th birthday he asked if he could play again, and since he was older, I said he could. But, the messages came back. He told me he was getting bullied. I told him to ignore the messages, and he did. Once again I told him not to talk to people online. A month or two after he began playing again, I came into his room to find that he was gone. He left a note on his desk that read something to the likes of: ""Hi mom! I'm at my friends house right now. Ill be back soon!"" He did not tell me before this, and he did not tell me which friend this was. When he returned home I asked him where he went, and once again he said he was at his friend's house. I asked which friend this was, and he told me he met him on Roblocks! I was outraged! I told him to remember the BIBLE! Romans 1:29-30 Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, quarreling, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip. They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. They invent new ways of sinning, and they disobey their parents. My son, sinning in my house! Since then my son has been banned from Roblocks, and I make sure he reads the Bible every week. This game allows for CHILDREN to meet up with potential PEDOPHILES! While I have not and have no wish to play this game, I have enough knowledge about it to know that it is an UNSAFE ""game"", if you can call it that!! I hope that my review will influence someone's decision.","Parent of a 9 and 15-year-old"
"age 10+","Roblox is appropriate for kids younger than 10, but there are some games that aren't. The only ""sexual"" stuff I have seen are kids joking around about sexual material, which isn't serious. The only problems I have are that you can bypass the safe chat, but it is extremely hard to do so now. Also, there are weapons and blood in some games, but blood is mostly minimal.","Adult"
"age 8+","If you are worried about toxicity in the chat I advise you to turn off the chat in settings. Also you should always monitor what child play on Roblox because there are users who deliberately try to break rules. Beware of scam messages that say something like ""You were chosen to recieve free robux, just go on (link of scam website)."" They are designed to steal passwords from users.
Also if you spend money on Roblox to buy virtual currency called Robux or any kind of Roblox membership if you want to refund those bear in mind that account will be banned forever.","Adult"

Subliminal at first but then he had to click on it to get rid of it!! That’s when I took it off him and then Really read the reviews for the game. There are some horror stories out there since users can create and upload their own games so super hard to regulate and content does not suit the suggested age range. Kids need to be more cyber aware before playing this game and scary to think it’s mainly aimed at 8-14 year olds.","Parent"

"age 18+","This online gaming platform is a disaster. Sometimes it's fine, but there are too many scammers and other bad news folks on it. Trading items is a huge part of the game, and our son was scammed for over $100 worth of material. The game moderators and Roblox themselves did nothing in response, despite having sufficient evidence that a scam had occurred.
In addition, the games create a desire for more ""Robux"" and rewards, and create artificial urgency causing kids to try to get these rewards. There are many accounts online of children engaging in dishonest behaviour to try to get stuff. It may not be a problem when they're younger and you're able to fully monitor their online activity, but if they keep playing it, there will be problems.
Bottom line: TO BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS.","Adult"

"age 10+","I find that Roblox is fun and safe but extremely addicting. I think it is addicting because it is social and social life is everything in middle school.

"age 10+","I've been playing ROBLOX since I was 12 years old, but 6 years later, my account was terminated under a false accusation of an unauthorized charge. Apparently the limit to taking action on this kind of issue is 30 days, and if you don't do anything they delete everything that has to do with your account. I spent over $600 dollars on this game and put countless hours of work into games I was creating. Prior to this ""unauthorized charge"" they didn't send me a warning that my account was in danger of being deleted, I didn't even find out until 4 months after it's termination. So far, I have been trying to resolve this issue, but the customer service is horrible. Every time I send an email we never get a direct response, and when I do I'm redirected to call the company, which instantly brings us to an automated voice mail, and no assistance. I wouldn't suggest playing unless you know that your money and account are safe and not at risk of being flushed down the toilet.","Adult"
"age 13+","All the other reviews are from 2011 - 2017. None are 2018, there may be some but I couldn't find any. Honestly Roblox is more safer than from the past. Roblox can teach you how to build a game and many more. There's a game called Wolves's Life 3 on Roblox by Shyfooxstudios. Their games are awesome!! I of course play Roblox, I played for 2 years now, 13 to14. My friend told me about it.
On chat in a server, you can barely say stuff that's appropriate and inappropriate, that's what I like about it! It just puts tags(#) for stuff inappropriate.
Of course I don't do that.
So, I recommend it to 13 and up! Trust me it's fun and safe! :) Have Fun!","Adult"
"age 10+","Greetings.Im a 16 year old roblox player for more than 3 years now and I'd like to officially state my opinion about this game.Im going to start with the advantages first.
1.Roblox gives you the chance of creating your own game and use your imagination.
2.You can talk with people from all over the world.
3.Lastly, you can gain some real money via developer exchange.
Disadvantages!:
1.Overpriced products.You cant change your avatar unless you pay.This is a totally 'pay to play' game.I got bullied quite alot of times because i didnt have any robux and i ended up paying to get some.Moreover, you cant create shirt/pants or publish more than one game unless you pay for bc.This is not 'powering imagination' as roblox says.
2. The community.There are many bullies out there and there is no player that was not a victim.Warning: all these three years that i was playing roblox, roblox did nothing to stop them.Moreover, there are dangerous people who steal personal info.
3.Online Dating(OD).ODing is a huge drawback of roblox.There are players who do some inappropriate acts(REALLY INAPPROPRIATE ACTS) and hangout like they 'know' each other ending up giving personal info.
There are soooo many disadvantages i want to write down but they are countless and i cannot keep typing forever.
For all parents I have just one thing to say:Do not allow your children who are under 10 to play this game.I have only 2 close friends and play games only for fun.","Adult"
"age 12+","I think most of the website is fine, it's just the players. Recently, the forums were shut down permanently because of a you-tuber called quackityHQ. He got his fans (mostly children and pre-teens) to spam the forums and get the mods and admins to un-ban him. It really shook everything up.
The player-base has some individuals who constantly call me noob, or ugly. It's ironic, because in most servers I am one of the more loyal and older players. Most of the players are safe and kind, however.
Roblox doesn't try to get you to pay money for memberships too much, and the robux and memberships are pretty cheap and non scamming (unlike Animal Jam). But remember to tell your children ""free robux"" sites are fake and potentially dangerous. If you don't want to pay with a credit card for robux and memberships, your country may have gift cards in store.
Events usually give rewards of hats and clothes to players, making up for not paying.
The filter is pretty safe for children, as there are two levels: under 13 and over 13.
Before making an account, decide what filter you child should use. Once you put your age under 13, you can not change it. There are also pins on the settings if you don't want them tampered.
All in all, it's not that bad, but I suggest teaching your child to: ignore mean comments/be nice/safety on the web/appropriate actions before creating an account.","Adult"
"age 14+","If you can't afford to spend real money prepared to be called a 'noob' and be constantly made fun of by so-called pros (who usually buy and dress in the most expensive and 'cool' clothing) and at times you even get singled out just because of your appearance. It's messed up and I feel like the game developers are money-hungry, why else would the only accessible way to get Robux is to spend your hard-earned money in order to customise your character, buy fun stuff and unlock cool features in this game. They don't even offer daily logins to get them, or watch videos or do surveys to get them. But the worst part of all is the bullies - many 7-12 year olds are exposed to the negativity and I think the company should really do something to minimise the bullying. I think the whole 'pro and noob' thing wouldn't have existed if the game actually had a way to get robux for free by doing offers, etc.","Parent"
"age 4+","ROBLOX is a great starter game, but I noticed they were taking off models and decals from me because they were inappropriate. This is RUDE and there is NO inappropriate things in the item. It's just ROBLOX's fault. Beware the shooting games and the online dating and there are hashtags. I also hate that we need real money for ROBUX.","Adult"
"age 8+","Use caution when buying things using Robux. If your child purchases something, they are stuck with it. If for some reason they remove an item from their catalog, it is like throwing it away. You cannot get the item back and they will not refund the Robux ($). Their customer support is less than helpful.","Parent of a 13-year-old"
"age 10+","They do have violent games sometimes. I say any kid over 10 would be alright the chat filters are super strong and nothing will go by them! Now about robux it is not a scam I was super surprised about this! But it works it really does! I would not mind spending another ten dollars because it is worth it!","Parent of a 11-year-old"
"age 6+","My kids play Roblox quite a bit, and they love it! I've even tried out a few games, and they were pretty fun. I have always allowed my kids to play Roblox, and they have enjoyed it. I decided that Roblox has changed a bit, so i wanted to get some other parents ideas on the game. I saw that almost every parent gave a complaint about chat. This was my main issue with it, being that they could chat with any player they came across. Being the geek i am, i went onto my sons account and looked through the settings. Sure enough, you can absolutely turn off chat! You just have to go into settings, Privacy, and then look for ""Who can chat with me in game"", and set that as No one. I also saw that there were parents saying about sexual themes and such, there is a reporting system. All you or your child has to do is press escape, click report, select the player or the game, and say what you are reporting them for. I also saw a few people mention about their kids being called a ""noob"" because they didn't buy in game money, but turning off chat fixes that. Turning off chat also partially eliminates the sexual behavior. With the chat, this lets your kid know what the other person is doing to you. However, without chat, it just simply makes them look strange. Setting your child's account as younger than 13 makes it so that they are protected from most bloody, sexual, or even scary games. The reason i suggested kids 6 and up is because by using those tips, it does protect them from a lot of things that are not good for them. That is what i found helpful, and i hope that this can help a few parents from exposing their child to those kinds of things.","Parent of a 11 and 13-year-old"
"age 8+","I think it has great moderation and is great for children playing. The moderators are great and friendly and are active so rarely there is any problems. Users who are under 13 will see something in the top right corner that says ""&lt;13"", this means that chat and privacy settings are active. Chat is filtered strictly which limits the contact kids have with adults but is also known as safechat. Users over 13 will see a ""+13 symbol in the top to show that privacy settings are disabled and chat is more freely, the user doesn't have safechat. If a user is under 13 then numbers will be filtered so a number may look like this ""there is # house"". Overall the game is good.","Adult"

"age 12+","My son (9) became obsessed with Roblox. There was a specific game that interested him the most (Jailbreak). This game had one rob banks, jewelry stores and people for Robucks to purchase items. Well, Roblox gives the option to purchase Robucks with actual money. He had $70 in iTunes and then somehow was able to continue purchasing through Apple. In the end, he spend $133 trying to purchase items in the game and advance. There are too many games that make it difficult to advance just by playing the game without spending ‘real money’. I have never seen my child so obsessed with a game. I actually just blocked the entire site from every device. He had at least 15 usernames and there was no way to control it. He now cannot even access www.roblox.com. He turned into an angry, aggressive, and obsessed child that only talked about Roblox. Every chance he got, he was playing. Now, he interacts with his siblings and actually plays outside!","Adult"
"age 9+","Let me begin by saying I’m a 39 year old father who has been gaming himself since the age of 5. My first games were on the Atari and I fell in love with the hobby and never looked back.
Watching my children play now is an interesting experience but I have seen this game in particular have some very negative effects on both my 5 year old and 12 year old.
Number one I would like to say to those parents out there, this game utilizes user created content. Meaning other users create the games that are available to play. Thus in turn having a wide selection of games to play that children love to explore but most are extremely crude and non polished to the point of being almost unplayable.
You will see some good designed games out there but the trash far outweighs the good. With this type of environment will come the eventual child breakdown , crying, anger, full blown meltdowns as they get stuck in geometry, get stuck because again it’s a crudely designed game by amateur game designers, have their points not register, and fave griefing from other players whose sole focus is to annoy the other players.
The list of things that will go wrong while playing this game could go on for much longer then I can write.
As for the content. Your children will be exposed to violent games that users create that replicate figures such as Freddy , Jason, creepy pasta figures, and so on. I’m not saying the game is solely populated by these games but they are there and easily stumbled upon.
There is also a high emphasis of designing non sensical games on popular internet memes, some of which are not appropriate for children under the age of comprehension of what satire means.
I can only recommend this game to children in the 5-7 age group with parental supervision.
8-10 year olds will find humor in it and mostly enjoy it for what it is.
By 12 it seems they have moved on from the extremely unpolished user created content and would rather spend their time on the major pc or console titles as well as spreading into cell phone entertainment.","Parent of a 12-year-old"

"age 13+","Roblux is plagued with security flaws and scammers who are constantly trying to take advantage of your children. I have taught my daughter never to give anyone her login information, but she is asked for it at least once a day from strangers promising free Robuxs. These strangers instead hack your child's account, and if you are unfortunate enough to have it tied to a credit card or mobile plan, the fees become enormous. Because of this, I used the two step verification, and still the account got hacked. Any programmer can tell you that the whole app is poorly designed. Please save yourself the trouble and buy Minecraft instead. It also encourages creativity without the scams and poor design.","Parent"
"age 18+","I have reluctantly and carefully let my children play Roblox and although they SOMETIMES got excited and had fun, they also get horribly distraught over getting ripped off (seriously, I've spent lots of money and games have stolen their ""robux"" money) and get they have gotten repeatedly bullied by other players. It is a nightmare I wish I never started.","Parent of a 17-year-old"
"age 10+","So the game can be the best thing your child has ever done or the worst if you have a child who knows better than to do some of the stuff in the game you got them a game that will keep them entertained and make them smarter than they all ready are,If your kid is the type who dose not know right from wrong well you have a problem and take them off of the game overall I have played this game it is fun but that is becauseI know better than to engage in date conversations along with my family. also even though you may be called a noob boi you do not know a insult as a kid I got teased way worse than being bad at a game I got teased for being the smart one physicaly and mentaly. finaly all the others with drinking,and swering uh check your facts as of 2018 roblox has gotten to be better i go in and see crap typed in one out of 30 games I join also why the heck would a kid go into a game with weed,cocain,alchahol they do not know about that and the haome screen would never contain those games finally I guaranty you check out other games on the web they are worse also your reason that your kids may have got bann from the game is because they hacked them selves some robux and will not tell you the truth so stop hating thats all","Adult"
"age 12+","The in app purchases in this game give little to no warning that you are purchasing anything and it's very very easy for kids to buy stuff. There is no confirmation screen, simply one click and your child has purchased $50 in""Robux"" currency. I'm unsure if there's a way to lock it but being a game specifically designed for young children, if there IS an option to lock it, it should come that way by default. That doesn't make make money off of children or their unwilling parents though. I didn't look deeper as it was deleted as soon as my bank statement showed it.","Adult"
"age 8+","We have allowed our boys to play Roblox for a year. Throughout the year they have gained our trust and quickly lost it again through this game. Let me first start by warning that there are definitely creeps playing this game. Not just kids. Our 2nd grader is obsessed with this game because his friends at school play, which is the ONLY reason we lasted a year. I know Roblox claims they have all of the parental features and security measures... They don't. Kids can get around them super easily. Kids can also create back up accounts. Some of our issues: Cyber Bullies -- for real, ""kids"" they don't even know. The music is ""clean"" versions, but IT IS NOT KID FRIENDLY music content even with the F word blocked. There are hack videos all over Youtube. Our of the 20 kids we know use it-- they all search for the hacks for free roblocks which managed to install a virus on Macs- no easy feat to find Apple viruses, thanks Roblox we had the computers for 12 years and our first virus came from Roblox hackers. And my favorite complaint of all? The ""kids"" my children meet. You know the ones that message them and ended up on my Facebook account trying to video chat with my 7 year old? More than once. This may be a looking kid-game, but the games, the content and the following is not appropriate for kids. Maybe high school kids that are REALLY bored. Roblox needs to get this gaming community under control.","Adult"
"age 6+","Roblox might have bad stuff but it is easy to avoid. And I did lie about age. As long as your kid plays an obby or something fun with no guns or dating, it will start at age 6. When your child is 7 through 10 guns can be good but not realistic. 11 through 14 is ok for realistic games and dating. 15 through 20. Everything is ok.","Adult"
"age 5+","ROBLOX was never intended for kids. When it released, it didn't say 'FOR KIDS'. Since new ROBLOX youtubers and minecraft youtubers have started playing ROBLOX, kids have been joining. I don't understand why people say ROBLOX is a kids game. The good things are that people can learn to script, or code. The worst things are that ROBLOX administrators don't monitor the platform much. It also has robux, which is a waste of money. There are also many games with violence and guns such as BLOODFEST, but players can choose what to play. It doesn't really have an age rating. Some games are under the radar and have 18+ things, which is a bad thing. Even though they get banned a lot, they're still there.","Adult"
"age 7+","This game is amazing for kids and up. This game is amazing on a lot of levels. You can make lots of friends, develop a game and learn the language of Lua while developing. You learn modelling, you can play online with the choice of millions, maybe even BILLIONS of games. There is much more that I can mention, But there would just be so much I would type. Great game, Would recommend for kids and adults.","Adult"
"age 9+","As a player of ROBLOX alongside my nephew, I highly dislike the fact ROBLOX is censoring the most stupidest words ever, some people can't type out numbers or even put the actual number, and they can't even say certain words, and the words I cannot say are of course the numbers and these few words: ""Friend"" ""Parent"" ""Guardian"" and ""Guide"" like, it's getting to the point where it's becoming another game called ""Wizard 101"" (Which I have played before and found it fun, but censorship is again bad.) Please, if you plan to play this game alongside your son, daughter, niece or nephew, that you look into getting ROBLOX to fix their censorship before speaking In-Game to your family member.","Adult"
"age 18+","My child played this for 2 months but one day on an app called ""Adopt and raise a kid"" the chat of other users said ""come and suck my ####"" and ""any cute girls wanna have ###"" I saw my child being on a bed while a guy said ""sucks ####""
I made him delete his account and uninstall,don't let your kid play this!","Adult"
"age 17+","Well, I was trying out roblox on my sons computer he's 8. But, I saw porn games with dicks and sex. This is not safe I found child predators pretending their 10 but really 60 they asked what school you go to and where do you live how old are you. Contains violence such as jeff the killer slenderman and stuff like that. I don't recommend this for kids.","Adult"
"age 6+","if you see # on chat messages then it might be a word that is not bad yeah maybe there might be blood but there are oders just report them there are some game that are good like work at a pizza place or lumber tycoon 2 or the first also for parents STOP OVERREACTING","Adult"
"age 18+","It is very stupid and I hate it.","Adult"
"age 6+","ROBLOX is absolutely fine. Yes, there are some concerns with workarounds for the chat filter, but the team is constantly updating ROBLOX in order to patch these things. There is also a report option so if someone is seen breaking the rules, administrators and moderators are able to look at the chat logs for that specific server and take the appropriate action.
Also, it's not just the playing side of the game that's good, there is the building and scripting kind. There is a whole ROBLOX wiki that can be looked through teaching you how to build, design and code in ROBLOX lua. Through this, you can make basically anything you have ever wanted, even if you have had no prior experience with coding.
The one thing that I would have to complain about is how difficult it is to get your account back, if hacked or lost. If your account is hacked or lost, you have to email ROBLOX which includes the account's username, and the issue you are having. You will then receive an instant, automated reply. After a couple of days, ROBLOX will email you asking for one of two things, if you have used a credit/debit card on the account, they will ask you for the last four digits on the credit/debit card's card number, this will verify to them that you own the account and they will email you a password reset link to get the account back. If you have used a game card, which can be bought at certain stores, they will ask you for the first ever game card you have used on that account, then they can verify your ownership and give you the account back. This is a big problem that many people face as usually, most people throw the game card out after it has been used, as it has been rendered useless, but without that or no other information on the account that can be used to verify your ownership of the account, they will not assist you any further and will close the case.
I have been signed up to ROBLOX for 8 years and have experienced no issues whatsoever. I have learned the coding language used, I can design and build games that get hundreds of thousands of visits. There is no need for me to buy a thing as people buy products for my games, and I earn from that.","Adult"
"age 18+","Dont let your kids play this. My child faked his age to get on this game, stole a credit card to purchase items on the game. I told the company many times as well as do all the confirmations to show the account is my my hands, the parent. They have done nothing to stop this activity. They will not close the account even though it was fake age, fake address, fake name, as well as a stolen credit card. Yet they will continue to take money from the account when my kids gave the password to another kid to ""keep playing"" for him. I informed the company and still did nothing. I changed the password and removed billing information from the gave and opened actions against this company. Fortunately my credit card has gotten most of the money back but this game is nothing but a scam. Lots of adults are chatting with your kids. Look it up. There are articles out there from pedoifiles telling others how to chat with kids on this game. Its sick and the game developers only care about your money. Be aware, these people are sick.","Parent of a 10-year-old"
"age 7+","Great messages:
I am a player on roblox myself for almost 5 years. I would say, depending which game you're playing on roblox there are nice people and less hackers.
Examples: ROBLOX High School (less hackers)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Safety and privacy concerns:
Yes, ROBLOX is a great game with good filtering, right? Well, that's not it.
There is also privacy mode and non-privacy mode, don't panic, parents because I will explain it right now.
if your child is under 13, they will get privacy mode. If your child is 13 or older, they get non-privacy mode.
Now, I should be getting non-privacy mode in March, But.. My birthdate is set to 2013 so I do have non-privacy mode for a while longer. But, that is besides the point.
Privacy mode: Basically, what you get is numbers censored, and trading etc, set to friends only. You also can't put social media links. For example: Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, Twitch etc. So, If i said ""I am 30 yrs old"" (I'm not 30) It would come out as ""I am ## yrs old"" So, until your child is 13, they won't be able to give out their age or say numbers. As in of in early 2017, Roblox made it so you can't change your age if you are under 13. Seems secure, right? No need to worry :-).
Non-Privacy mode: Basically the opposite of what i just typed.
----------------------------------------------------------
Too much consumerism:
Okay, So.. There isn't TOO much consumerism, but there is just a little if you plan on buying robux. (roblox currency) or builders club (roblox vip) It has happened to me. I bought 35,000 robux for $199.95 dollars so I could get the neon pink top hat.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Too much swearing:
Again, there isn't too much swearing. But, people find ways to bypass the filter. for example, someone in the game i was in said ""fusck"". It worked for a day, but now it's censored. Also, my friends died in ""the normal elevator"" from the kool-aid man, so, he thought saying ""Fuck."" (with the ""."") wouldn't work, But, he said it anyways and it worked, Of course, It got patched about 6 months ago.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too much sex:
OKAY, STOP! Don't stop reading yet! This is the last one!
For example, these are types of sex scenes i've seen on roblox: exploiters (hackers), sitting+standing, and more hackers putting gross images. So, once I was playing beach house roleplay with my irl ex, and saw a girl opening up her vegina and showing it on a picture. okay, tbh. it was a little funny but more stupid.
So.. It is a good game overall, I don't think you need parental advisory if you are over the age of 9. It is pretty educational with building and scripting/programming. :-)

"age 10+","Roblox is a great game and really boosts your child's imagination. However, it is also a way for 40 year olds to ""talk"" with your child. In the roleplaying games, there is always a player looking to do sexual activity with others. Also lots of swearing as players bend around the chat moderation system. This system is consistantly being improved by Roblox. Besides these things, Roblox is a great game.","Adult"
"age 18+","I first as a kid taught ROBLOX was the best game. All my friends and I used to play but after I saw everyone trying to say bad things about the game I still didn’t stop .
My mom saw difference in me and just today I threatened to kill my older sister. About a year ago I had no idea what idiot was now because of ROBLOX i know the b***** and f****** . This game is totally not for kids and anyone else .I recommend that you block the game from your router . I bought robux with my moms credit card for 30 dollars. But then some hacked and took some away. I am so addicted to this game and I hate how I have become. My mother made me read a lot of reviews and now I now that I must stay away from this game .","Parent"

"age 7+","Although it used to be a GREAT game that I would recommend to nearly anyone, it quickly changed into a site filled with bullying, hacking/exploiting, scamming, and more. This is coming from a veteran's perspective.
Bots and scams:
Their bot protection takes the word garbage to a new level, as their only bot protection is a single ReCapcha when you create an account. ""Free ROBUX"" games, which are scams, manage to reach front page and stay there for days before getting taken down. (ROBUX is the currency on this game.) Comment sections nowadays have nothing in them except for ROBUX scams. There are literally millions of scam-bots in ROBLOX.
Community:
Most of the community, is actually horrible. Many people are gullible and fall for ""If you don't copy and paste this, you will die!"" comments and generally flood the comment sections that are not ruined by bots. Many people start rumours about hackers (Such as the John Doe incident) Many Youtubers break some of the ToS.
Online Dating:
One of the biggest problems in ROBLOX. It can be found in nearly every game, aside from shooter games. Not much to say about it.
Games:
Many games are basically copies of other games. Some games are rather violent, sexual, or other.
Violence:
Most games aren't violent, as they use the classic kid friendly death. But, there are some other games which are just straight gory.
Horror Games:
Although most of them aren't against the ToS, some of them are just too gory.
Corrupt Administrators:
Online dating and rulebreaking Youtubers were allowed to live because they promoted ROBLOX before. Other Youtubers, did nothing yet got banned. Some of the moderators did nothing about rumours. ""Bloxy Awards"" are most likely rigged, as the main winners are people who sponsored ROBLOX before, aside from one or two people who didn't.
Reporting:
The reporting system is basically giving ROBLOX a piece of paper. ROBLOX takes that piece of paper and throws into a shredder, then burns it. ROBLOX doesn't actually care about reports.
Exploiters and Hackers:
ROBLOX has this thing called ""FE"" which breaks many scripts, but prevents common exploiters. Other than that, ROBLOX has way too many exploiters and hackers.
Updates:
Nearly every update from ROBLOX is lazy nowadays, and does nothing except break scripts and add things despite the communities protest. Nearly everyone in ROBLOX dislikes Anthro, yet ROBLOX is still adding it.
Summing it all up::
It's bad.","Adult"
"age 14+","I have just gotten Roblox and had it for about a week now. I immediately lost interest at the ads on the side of the main screen (or whatever it's called... where all the games are) When there were all these ads that said ""Before Roblox"" (a demented looking toddler) ""After Roblox"" (It showed a taller person who had more cosmetics and looked ""cooler."" Of course that meant to be cool you had to buy pixels that meant nothing in the real world, yet costed money. I am New to Roblox so I thought nothing of it and pushed it to the back of my mind. I went on to one of roblox life simulation things only to find it was filled with racism (baconism) and hatred. I didn't know why all these people were calling me names like-- P*ece of Sh*t and ""Disgusting Bacon hair"". I did not realize it but bacon hair is the default skin of your character if you haven't purchased any cosmetics or Aesthetics. So The people of Roblox are making fun of you because you don't have any money in their made up world.
I am sorry if this informational paragraph has not made any sense to you... Roblox got into my head.","Adult"
"age 18+","Parents beware. Today my child came across a game “Where’s the baby”. The player selects a weapon, and then finds a baby to kill. It is appalling. Delete or block this game platform.

"age 18+","Heads up, parents! The Roblox app is a very popular one among my daughter's friends, and I mistakenly allowed her to download and play it without first doing some research on my own.
If you're not familiar with it, your child can enter different worlds like Meep City, hospitals, pizza parlors, etc. They can change their clothes, furnish their homes, make pizza deliveries...it a great concept and my daughter really enjoyed playing it. Last night, she was playing with a personal friend and my daughter's game name was changed to ""Ihate###"" (her friend's name). DD was in tears that her friend would think she was bullying her, so I texted the mom and both girls got off it asap.
I looked into the app more this morning and see that there are all kinds of inappropriate layers hidden in this game that aren't initially evident to parents. Sexual content, bad language, *a lot* of bullying, behavior that looks like grooming, and hackers even changing parts of a child's world, similar to my daughter's name change. (I read a review where one girl's kitten wallpaper was changed by a hacker to depict sex acts.) And, finally, worlds that are all about killing and violence. While my daughter has no interest in that type of game, it's far too accessible.
Lesson learned on my part...no more app downloads based on the assurance from an 8 year that it's safe. (pretty dumb of me) A lot of the content went over DD's head and she simply had no idea what was there. I'm just glad that what happened to my daughter was minor compared to some of the things I read.
I use Common Sense Media to check out most movies before we watch them, I didn't realize that it has app reviews, too. In this case, there are reviews for Roblox as far back as 2009...I read many, but paid more attention the those written within the past few years. It's scary what I found. It appears that the Admin monitoring on Roblox is now non-existent.","Adult"
"age 10+","Roblox is a great platform to build at. Having fun etc.
But, There is currently the ''report'' system which doesn't do anything.
Since I have been a member since 2014 at Roblox I have at least send over 17 emails to Roblox Customer Support. I have gotten my problem fixed. Or it has been worse.
Roblox has currently ''Safe chat'' which is not a good thing. As you cannot type what house you live in as. In a game and you want a hotel Room. The staff at that hotel ask you what room. And then you say the number which is ### (312). They should un-tag the words.
Online Daters.
There is a lot of online daters on Roblox, which Roblox doesn't take care of. But else they are a bit rare.
Moderation.
Roblox doesn't have the best Moderation. As the Report system, Customer service etc. They ban or warn people for a ''non valid'' reason.
Customer Service.
The customer service is bad. Really bad. There is a chance of 25% your problem will get fixed.
Community.
The Comunity at Roblox is PERFECT. It is fun to speak with others and that! But Roblox always goes against the Community.
Conclusion.
Great Game. Bad Moderation. False Advertising. Good Community.","Adult"
"age 9+","I think you parents are plain wrong. I saw my child watching a video by a person named Skeleton Reality or something along the lines of that making fun of parents giving bad reviews. Although I would not support things like that, I do agree on him on some things. Parents say “OH THERE WAS CUSSING.” There is safe chat to block cussing, phone numbers, addresses, etc. There is some violence, but not too much. Also, the naked body part thing. There are no private parts. It’s just a skin colored LEGO man. No private parts, unless someone is hacking (1 out of 1000th chance) And also, the “My ### hurts.” It’s just ROBLOXS way to censor bad words. Maybe the ### was just eye because it censors not bad things too. Also no one can tell age because if they say a number it appears as #. Do NOT let your child play Phantom Forces!! It has guns and blood. It’s not the games fault there are pedophiles! It happens in all games! Stop posting idiotic reviews on this GOOD game... They also removed free currency “Tix or Tickets” just so people could buy Robux. Overall this game is pretty good. You should monitor your child from time to time though. By the way, THERE ARE NO DRUGS OR PORN. Sex happens but there’s no private parts which is bad. ALSO DO NOT PLAY RAISE A BABY.","Adult"
"age 6+","Parents should allow their kids to play because it's really not that bad. The hackers aren't even hackers, they're just people who happened to convince your child to give them personal info.. which does not constitute hacking at all. You should warn your child about these people and tell them to not give any passwords, or anything that they can work with to harm them.. I played this game as a child and had no problem with it. No viruses, nothing. I go back to it once in a blue moon, and it's still a lot of fun.","Adult"
"age 4+","There is no such thing as a real safety monitoring, it does not required parent permission, a kid can just create an account without any email/phone confirmation.

When I went to the computer and saw the video I was mortified. My daughter and “friends” were naked men with large penises sexually going after another bent over naked man character. I had no idea this was possible, and add to the fact that they were dared or as I look at coerced into doing something they knew was wrong and inappropriate.

Why you ask, it is extremely inappropriate, innocent children, like my sister who is under the age of 8, was asked repeatedly to imitate sexual actions, do other nasty things like remove all articles of clothing, and ask friends to do the same. I was disgusted by this, and there were many other things that make this game horrible. In many games, there are clubs that involve drinking, with ACTUAL DRINKS, not like Coke or Sprite. There are drugs that are also given out by the kids, which I think is horrid that kids are being exposed to this. Spoiled rats, the bullies of Roblox, brag about robux, and make others feel bad about themselves. They abuse and harass other players which is unacceptable, their parents should be notified by their actions!! Some kids swear and curse, and make fun of others who don't. Younger kids who don't understand any of this, soon start to speak these words in their daily life. Is this the new generation we were looking forward to?

All you people that are saying bad stuff about ROBLOX, well, that's because there are hackers. I agree that the moderators aren't that active, but at least the game has moderators. Even if you see those weird games, just look deeper into it. Also, not all ROBLOX games are bad just because one is. Some games, like Ultimate Driving, can give you a taste of some jobs, like police officer, 18 wheeler driver, or even tow truck guy. Yes, we need better moderator activity. Yes, we need better anti-exploit scripts. But no, we don't need to be dissing ROBLOX for something that's not even their fault. And the swearing, ROBLOX hashtags it, unless you can change the message. All in all, ROBLOX is a great game for all ages.","Adult"
"age 18+","My 9 year old begged for Roblox; I finally signed myself up to play to see what he would experience. I read all the glowing descriptions of creativity and social play--and I cannot say anything against the programming aspect of this. But I played two games '[Party] Robloxian High School' and 'Jailbreak'. It's not surprising that kids indulge in 'bad behavior' when they can. As a kid, I certainly cursed whenever parents weren't around. But in this anonymous environment, it is constant nastiness daring people to 'hug' + 'kiss' alongside constant threats to kill. There is a filter for bad language--which players have quickly and adeptly figure out work arounds to get their message across. Primarily this was simply the result of whoever was playing, but in Jailbreak, an aspect of the game was thus:
TODAY’S MISSION: 9:21:33 left to complete mission!
Kill 10 players by punching them
OK, I understand that may be mild in the world of video games today, I am simply providing context that the 'nasty' tone of the pl.ayers can be echoed in the games themselves
One player in the high school game was calling women 'b-----s' and 'wh---s' and threaening them. There is a function to report abuse--but that particular players name was unavailable to report--no idea why--other names were listed and available to report.
All in all, I had a very short visit in two games--and found it rather demoralizing. My advice: learn to program and play elsewhere. The wild west internet is NOT a place to nourish young minds and hearts. Do whatever it takes to avoid this particular future--build a tree house, write a book of poetry.,,
There is an under 13 setting in Roblox, and if you turn off chat options entirely--maybe there is a safe path forward, but I think that you would have to be vigilant. I still think there are other ways to program, play, etc without submitting to the www (wild west web). And don't forget--the woods are nice.","Parent of a 9-year-old"
"age 13+","This is the worst game I have ever seen. I know Counter-strike, I know GTA but this is worse. Counter Strike ? Ok, your kid shouldn’t be able to get it on his/her computer, so until you buy them this game it shouldn’t be dangerous. But your kid can create an account and you could not notice. He needs e-mail, if he is over 9 yo he is able to get an email into it AND if he/she knows your e-mail he could enter it there and you cannot cancel it anymore. This game is also pay to win, so if he wants to win he will probably ask you for your credit card. Don’t do that, because you can buy him Minecraft for those money, that is like 100x more safe and everything. Their virtual currency are robux. You could pay like 25E for some robux, to buy a radio that applies ONLY to that selected server, so if the server crashes or something, you can’t do anything. And now to the worse a single hacker can get onto your kid’s tablet a big picture of porn or whatever he likes. And if he meets a child predator he can get some info from your kid if your kid isn’t careful enough. My daughters played this and they couldn’t stop, some guys from all over the world got my daughters skype and played with them. Then they told me if they can get anything for their school report. I told them that they can and they told me that they want to put 50€ in it. They’re two so 25€ each, I agreed. I looked to their inventory what they have bought and it was a RADIO into a game called “murder mystery” where is one murderer one detective and innocents and murderer must kill everyone, thats a game for 8 YO KIDS?! My daughters are 11, but still. The only thing the radio can do is it can play music in-game. GUYS, listen, you can turn on internet find ANY song (with the radio there is only limited amount of songs you can play.) and play the song on background and turn on the game. That was a total waste of money. Don’t do the same mistakes as I did please.","Parent of a 11 and 12-year-old"
"age 18+","I heard my little Timmy say ""heck"" and I asked him where he heard that from and he said one of his friends from school said it while playing Road Blocks. This game is obviously by the devil, it is pure evil. I have grounded my son for 5 years for mentioning such a name and saying such a vile word. This game promotes terrorism and is filled with sex predators. Some say they're just 12-year-olds saying curse words, but I say they are sex predators, because only sex predators would swear like that!","Parent of a 6-year-old"

"age 12+","Roblox is a good website. The moderators do a good job banning malicious/mature content. You can choose who you can talk to, so there's a lot of privacy settings. My daughter plays roblox and she's 13. She loves it because of all the fun games. Me myself, am not against the app. Yes, I know. You're another worried parent who probabky doesn't trust your kid. But trust me. This app is fine.","Adult"
"age 6+","Roblox is run by scam artists.
My son's account was compromised by a hacker and when we tried to get the account back, the administrators made it impossible to verify ownership of the account. The were asking for the PIN number of the FIRST EVER game card redeemed against the account from over a year ago. The card was discarded once redeemed as it seemed useless, but obviously not. I believe they make it purposely difficult to gain access to your account as it will force you to create a new one and spend more money.
With the poor admin assistance, poor in-game moderation of abuse and over all lack of anything remotely child friendly, I would steer clear of this game altogether!","Adult"
"age 6+","ok you idiots who are like omg omg omg why are they playying these games and talking to these people no no no thats not ur problem its for you having a lack of iq and turning safe chat on so to the good news i started roblox in 2012 when i was 6 im 12 right now it is safe for all ages and very educational and if you want to keep your kids away from violent games like prison games then this enable the option in the settings it has a lot of games like phantom forces/free call of duty 3 it is endless you can even make a living off it the only thing is that roblox cost money to get game currencys OF COURSE for developers can make a living","Adult"
"age 12+","Roblox can be a fun game, but you need to teach your child well what she can't do. Roblox is a dangereous game, i will tell everything that you need to be aware about roblox, this comes from a roblox veteran.
First,
Roblox is full of Online Daters, you may ask what this means. Online Daters(In roblox) are people who do the following:
Have sex,
Say things like ""Wanna f*ck"" or ""Want to be my GF""(Girlfriend), Sometimes even ask for their address. Online Dating can get very personal. Teach your child to stay away from them or stop them.
Next thing is that the moderating system is horrible, censors things that should not be censored and doesn't take down things that should. Also, there is a little ""Report"" button there that you can report bad behavior. Sadly, it doesn't work. The game has an bad community, for example: Online Daters, Bullies, and bad people in general.
Next item is pedophiles. Roblox is pedophiles's favorite game. Be very cautious, the chances are low, but pedophiles can sometimes meet kids in real life.
Next is the ""Safe"" chat. The ""Safe"" chat censors things that shouldn't be censored and can be easily bypassed.
Next is scammers. Scammers are people that claim they will give you ""1 million free robux"", which is obviously a scam. When people get scammed, they can lose their accounts or even worse: get a virus. If they lose their accounts, they lose everything they had on that account: Robux, BC(I will explain these paid items later), Badges, etc.
Next is paid items. Not only that they are overpriced, for example: you just bought 22,500 robux(U$199.99)for your child and then that's where the overpriced items come in, in the next day, you find out your child used all their robux on one, pointless item. A waste of money. BC stands for Builders club, you get advantages in-game if you buy BC. there are three kinds of BC: Builders Club, Turbo Builders Club(TBC), Outrageous Builders Club(OBC). BC has good advantages, but, again, it's overpriced.
Next is bullies. Yep, i don't have to explain this one.
Next is bad updates. This isn't much of a problem for parents but it can affect the child's gameplay. For example, forums, the forums used to help alot, but now they removed it. Actually, roblox should be called removal simulator. And there is a very high chance that roblox will add ""Anthro"" you may ask what anthro is. Roblox characters look like lego characters. But anthro brings a whole new thing: Realistic avatars. Anthro can motivate Online Daters to play more.
Next is violent and inappropriate games, Well, you know, people can make their own games, so that means they can remain a long time undiscovered in the thousands of games that roblox has. Inappropriate games like having sex, etc.
There is MUCH more bad things about roblox. You can keep up with the bad things that roblox is doing in the youtube channel greenlegocats123. No, this is not advertising. I don't own this channel. Hope you learned a bit more about roblox.","Adult"
"age 16+","This game has resently outlawed in our home. It’s extremely addicting, cause antisocial behavior, affects ability to keep time and I believe was very damaging to our 10 yr old son. His personality changed, he began lying and sneaking time to play. When he wasn’t able to play he’d sneak YouTube and watch others play.
He is currently “detoxing” from anything and everything related to it. They absolute worst decision was inviting it into our home and life. 100x worse than Minecraft.
This game is also VERY expensive. Upgrades are available for real money but the exchange rate is way off.
The chat feature is also concerning. Many people asking for login info and trying to scam others.
If you invite Roblox into your home please closely monitor. Our son became a completely different person.","Adult"
"age 10+","So obsessive!","Parent of a 10, 12, and 16-year-old"
"age 15+","I am a kid,But I do not recommend this to you parents.When I was new at first which I didnt have a thing called ""robux"" Which roblox makes you buy like 450 for 4.95,Anyways I went onto these disturbing games like ""Adopt and raise a cute kid"" ""Roblox High School"" And just got disturbed and bullied on it of apparently me being a ""bacon hair"" Which just terribly offended me and while i was young at the time I started crying so I rilly dont recommend to other children,But when I did buy robux I started making friends,It just pisses me off nowadays..I dont talk to the rich people,I talk to the poor people and once I gave one robux. Just definetly dont get this.","Adult"
"age 11+","Its a game where people can make anything what do you expect from a game like this? there are 50-60 mods and 60 million+ users what do you expect? i want to say they are good at moderating it just takes a while to find things people are criticizing the game for the players not for the game itself also go into the privacy settings there multiple things you can do i made it so only friends can message me i keep chat on but ignore and report messages that have bad words so please let your child play this game. also the only way to find not kid friendly games is to search them i know this because i look at recommendations and front page games only. online daters? ignore them if you get asked out in game say no simple as that. so just please listen to this review","Adult"
"age 18+","Really inappropriate, sensors all numbers but not the curse words. To many online daters, the games are not fun. Toooooo much lag! Don’t play!","Adult"
"age 18+","woblox is very wery... I alwaz get scarred. THERE ARE OLD MEN ON da sit. It beeeeee werd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Adult"
"age 5+","The game is child friendly and the only thing wrong is that on the t&amp;c's say online daters will be banned and they never do. So apart from that the platform is fully child friendly, this platform has thousands of games created by many of the users and if they are inappropriate it will be taken down and the user will be punnished.","Adult"
"age 8+","So far, this ""company"" has made $82.90 worth of unauthorizaed charges on my account. they started by double charging me and then started just charging my card for the fun of it. They won't tell me when the charges happen and so far, they're talking in circles to avoid giving me my money back. So, I had to pay my bank to stop any future FALSE transactions from them and now I have to cancel my debit card and get a new one all because these people are crooks. Whatever you do, DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR CREDIT CARD INFO.","Parent"
"age 6+","This game is good but there can be some mean players but roblox doesn't ban them but you can block them.","Adult"
"age 14+","As a 13 year old, I’ve been playing this game since 2011. I was 7. That young where I knew nothing about what I was going to learn in the next 60 seconds. As I grew, I don’t see Roblox as a family friendly game.
I believe that a parent needs to monitor their child’s activity on Roblox. The reason why it’s addictive is because that’s Roblox’s bait to lore you into paying and paying and paying. Not only you have to pay to actually have fun, most of the things are overpriced.
There’s a currency in the game called “Robux” where you pay to get cool hats, gear, shirts, game passes, and more. When it comes to overpriced items that cost over 100,000 robux, that would cost about $10,000 of real money.
Even if you choose not to pay, your child may be stumbling across being bullied and being made fun of for your look. When there’s games like “Adopt and Raise a Cute Kid” or “Meep City,” that’s the point where all your child sees is people dating online and being asked out.
If someone is being harassed, betrayed, or oppressed online, the Roblox moderation team couldn’t care less. They do nothing.
Why is it so addictive? For money. Money is better off in YOUR pocket. Not theirs.
The most thing children get angry about is the fact that Roblox would censor most of the things they say. It would turn certain words and sentences into #########.
People do inappropriate things on Roblox. It’s not that Roblox is making these games that involve sex and violence. Anyone can jump onto Roblox Studio and make games to publish.
This game is highly known for online dating, bullying, and inappropriate content. Mostly that Roblox removes things that everyone loves.
If your child plays this game, I recommend you monitor his/her activity and make sure he/she is careful and watches his/herself. One tiny movement can cause an accident. There’s also so many scams on Roblox that seem too good to be true. They lore your child into putting in their passwords and expecting “free robux” but instead getting their accounts hacked.
Hope this helps and I hope you have a great day!!","Adult"
"age 18+","I've learned a lot about Roblox since my kids started playing and nothing I've learned makes me feel good about letting them play it. I've only ever let them play it with the chat setting turned off and have told them never to accept a friend request from someone they don't know.
That makes it almost palatable for me to allow them to play, however, my daughter informed me today that when she played as a ""guest"", a feature they used to offer that I specifically chose because there is supposed to be very little interaction between you and other players, she was sexually propositioned by another player. I'm not even sure how this happened but this is just the last straw for me.
Even as an under 13 player, you can enter into ""parties"" set up by other players. Most of these parties have scantily clad block women dancing to songs with misogynistic themes and inappropriate lyrics (curses are bleeped out but there are still sexually suggestive lyrics).
Avoid this game. My son still plays but only when I'm in the room and watching like a hawk where he goes and who he interacts with.","Parent"
"age 6+","REALLY OUTSTANDING direct, swift, simple response to my quiery regarding billing - terminating an automatic payment and getting a FULL REFUND very, very promptly, without questions (ALMOST IMMEDIATELY).
Truly superb service. Highly recommended company/product/support.","Parent of a 17-year-old"
"age 18+","This game looks like it’s for kids but it’s not! Users create worlds and games so this can mean very adult content. A 7 year old was playing and told me they had seen people having sex regularly and also oral sex too :( apparently having sex was one of the challenges in the game. Luckily the child didn’t actually know what it was they were describing. Other kids have now told us this happens all the time.","Parent of a 9 and 14-year-old"
"age 18+","I'm sorry, but when a kid has to see the most inappropriate image I've ever seen, I'm done. Seriously, this is not for kids. 13+ account with access to very very adult content in a supposedly innocuous game. I don't care how fun it is, kids shouldn't be exposed to that. We have to protect our kids. People can hack the game and have things pop up you can't un-see.","Adult"
"age 11+","I have been playing ROBLOX for about a year and a half, and I know thats not very long, but i have seen some pretty bad things on the game (sadly). ROBLOX itself isn't a bad game, but its the community and some of the moderators that don't do their job correctly, some players are found hacking and admin abusing other players, and older kids are doing some pretty messed up things. The games are pretty fun, well most of them..... the game has a few clickbaits and ""Free Robux"" games which I warn you and other kids and parents to understand that there is NO way to get free robux, you need to use your actual MONEY. Online dating, see it often; many people refer those players as ""Oders"", we have 8 and younger kids online dating to what might be some perverted old men that is you know, catfishing, but the young ones just don't understand.... I think that spending $200 dollars on fake credit, is retarded, and the prices of buying robux is just absurd.. but here are some good things about roblox- Roblox is a place to make new friends, fun games, dressing up, roleplaying and just having fun like any kid wants to have, at such a young age there is a big world ahead of them, but sometimes its ok to get a break and some fun from school, chores, etc. There are so many fun games to play, not all are violent; ROBLOX is a addicting game for me, and i know that parents are upset that their kids are being so addicted but maybe if they would just teach their kids about the real world and go over the rules, then maybe they wouldn't have issues....
