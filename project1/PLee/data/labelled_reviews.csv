a,It’s too scary It's funny but the Car never has any clothes on and it's too scary
s,"A GOOD RACING GAME!!! Although the movie is not that good, the game is actually very entertaining! There is violence, especially with the machine guns, but no blood shown. For a game that is based on a terrible movie, it is pretty fun!"
s,"Great game! I think this game is great! My husband, son, and I can all play together as a family and have a great time, it's fun for everyone. Yes, there is violence- shooting other cars, knocking them off track, etc. But the cars don't ""die"", they just lose spots in the race and have to catch back up. If your child can grasp the difference between video game and reality, if you have an open dialogue about violence in your every day lives, and if you thought the Cars 2 movie was appropriate for your kids - go for it!"
a,"Son loves it, but too violent I am disappointed that there are guns and shooting in this game. I told my mom to buy this for my son for the holidays because he likes cars and I was looking for a racing game for him. He instantly loved the racing part, but after a couple of rounds the races became violent with him activating bombs and machine guns and shooting down and blowing up other cars. I was so mad! I have tried very hard to monitor in what way my kids are exposed to guns and violence so that we can discuss it properly, and I was caught off guard with this one. I guess I didn't dig deep enough before making the assumption that Disney would be appropriate for my 7 year old.
On the other hand, he is absolutely in love with the game and is having a blast playing it...I just wish I could feel as good about him playing it. Of course it opened discussion about guns and violence and cartoon violence versus real world violence, but he is 7 for crying out loud...why are we having to have this conversation...kids are growing up too fast these days...and the media isn't helping us shield our children from the very real violence of our world."
s,Nostalgia. has quite a few explosions (not that bad) and is quite easy to learn.
a,"Great game THe message is if someones a meanie, shoot dem with ur machine gun or explode dem"
s,"Not horrible,but the movie is WAY BETTER! OK,this is a sort of entertaining game,but it gets boring WAY TOO QUICKLY! I wish the game stayed FUN!"
s,"Can kinda get boring, don't you think? This is really not a bad game, but this is a ripoff hot wheels: beat that game, and the graphics are not as good as the first Cars game."
s,"Cars 2 needs a refill It's the best movie licensed game I've played (it barely escaped the barrel), but compared to others, that doesn't say much. The cars are very unstable and hard to completely control, the weapons are pretty much useless, and Lightning McQueen barely cracks a single ""Ka-chow!"" in the game, despite the annoying number of times he says it in the movie promos. ""Bonus stages"" where you have to kill cars lacks good AI, and the product placement alone (movie and game) is an unfamiliar jerk away from the classic theme in the original. I wouldn't fully recommend this game, but for desperate game-night families, it's worth a go."
a,"Nice, but, Some Violence"
s,"Cars 2: the Video game! -- FUUUN! This game is to me, VERY fun! You get to do multiple things, you can do free races, lessons, and battle races, which have weapons along the way that you can shoot at other racers to get ahead. And you can do up to 4 players in any game! I would suggest renting this game from Redbox or something because it depends on who rents it if they like it or not. I personally really enjoyed it and so did my dad, and sister. If you like any type of racing game, or enjoyed Cars 2 the movie, I would definately try this one!"
s,Cute game! It's actually REALLY fun! Great game for kids. Some explosions.
s,"Fun, exciting, then it whines down very slowly. Now this game isn't too violent, but you can see cars flipping out of control and machine guns called machine guns and act like machine guns, and ARE machine guns... But still the racing is exciting, fast... But then slows down with the stupid controls.
I like the mariokart style wiimote tilt control, but to backwards drive you must press down on the D-pad, but you must also hold down for 3-4 seconds until it works...
CONCLUSION:
Before buying this, rent it first, I liked it but still it seemed boring (Maybe due to lack of hub world i loved in cars the game) Another thing is this game also uses internet interactions with the world of cars online, that extends the lasting appeal."
s,dsdsaddsjfhsbdjkcisozdnov It's Glitched at the end.
a,"Extreme combat racing follows the movie's main storyline! Love it! Awesome! If you like the movie, then you'll love the game. Lots of gunfire, explosions and weapons are used. The game's storyline is almost the same as the movie. The game actually takes place after the movie. Some levels in the game don't even have to do with racing. Some have to do with hunting down ""bad guys"". Some also have to do with surving an attack by collecting ""batteries"" to keep your ""shield"" activated. There is also one multiplayer game called ""Disruptor."" The object of it is to collect ""bombs"" to place in the opposing team's base, to destroy it. So as you can see, it's not just a racing game. It's a spy game. Kids 10 and up can play. Anyone under 8 might find it either too hard to play, or too violent. The game has simple controls. The Wii version gives a more realistic driving experience by letting you tilt the Wii remote to steer left and right. Therefore, it is a little bit harder to steer. Although, that isn't the only control you can use. You may also use it with the nunchuk or the classic contoller. You can even use the Nintendo Gamecube contoller. If you are looking for a good action racing game, then this is the way to go."
s,Great Free-To-Play Superhero Game My children and I have had a great deal of fun playing this together. It has a surprisingly solid co-op mission system with well designed boss battles.
s,"fun but frustrating. although this game is fun and entertaining, the fact that we have to buy gold coins to continue to play is a rip off. My son, whom is 8 years old is frustrated because he can't progress forward in the game without getting gold, which costs money, real money not play money."
s,"Great for Kids 8+ Mild violence, fun characters to play with!
Great game but don't take my word for it.
play now! at hero up . com"
s,"SHSO Review It's a fun and easy MMO to play, simply? What more can you ask?"
s,"Not that violent There is no blood, death, or any things that are TOO violent.
However, there are a little bit of violent like hitting and kicking and using weapons. But for a 9-year old it's not very scary.
It is educational when your kids burst your creativity by customizing their very own HQ and pick a silly username.
- Lily Schultz"
a,"IF YOUR TEEN IS MATURE, THEN GET THIS GAME! Recently, I got the directions cut version of this on the WII U and it is violent! 1. You can kill anyone you see and any gruesome way you want. 2. Prostitutes are shown in brothels. 3. Drugs are discussed causally and a the start a man is smoking weed.
Overall, not at all appropriate for kids and infants."
a,"It's all about choice I don't think this game is that bad for kids, the violence is there but not as violent as other games, you can shoot any person but it will have a bad consequence for your character. I played this using stealth all the game and also the game gives you the option of not killing guards but to leave them unconscious, it is a great game but it all depends on how you play it, how bad it will bee for your kid. You can take decisions that will make people die or lie in your own benefit but you can always do the right thing. It's all about choice."
a,":) This game is for a mature audience. But not just because of the violence, language, and innuendo. The game contains several themes (globalization, trans humanism, greed, etc) that are too complex for kids. Nonetheless, get this game. Parents, know that Adam can take down enemies non-lethally."
a,"A world, not a game The most ambitious and compelling game I have ever played, and I think everyone mature enough to play it despite the mature content should witness a virtual world pretending to be just a game."
a,"Cjgr Great game. Violence, but game doesn't dwell on it, some swearing but NO sex"
a,"Violent, but not too violent This game isn't as inappropriate as the esrb or commonsense media say. The sex is nothing, with the worst thing walking into a brothel for certain missions. The language is not often there, and is only bad occasionally. The drinking is discouraged, and has absolutely no perks, so its not bad. The only thing is that when you choose to use violence, it has some blood. You can also use you augmentations to kill people, making it more close up. Still, its really not that bad, with just as much blood as some T games like ghost recon. Thats why i think anyone 12 and up is fine with this game."
a,"language is the only bad thing This game is on the milder side among M rated games. Although common sense media exaggerates everything, this game is not that bad. There is no forces violence, and when violence is chosen, its quick and nothing gruesome or all that bloody about it. Also, its easy to die in this game, so its not likely that violence will be chosen anyways. Like all other reviewers on this site, I agree that there is absolutely nothing to be worried about sex wise. Theres no nudity, no sex, and the worst thing you can do is talk to a prostitute and have her compliment your augmentations, which are basically machine transplants that make you superhuman. The drinking is discouraged, so thats not a problem. The only potential thing is language, and while when they use it, its fairly strong, with a couple of f***s and s***s and some other weaker things like b****** and b****. But hte thing is, is that its not used often at all! Really, I think that anyone 13 an dup would be fine with this game."
a,"Not bad at all Honestly, this game is not bad at all. There is only as much violence as the player wants there to be, and even then, its not as much as call of duty or halo. There is curses, but only in fights, where the player is too busy to really pay attention. there is absolutely NO sexual content what so ever, and when you drink, it only has negative effects. The only reason i would reccomend that only people over 12 get this game is because people younger than that probaably wont understand the plot. It really is not bad at all."
a,"There is no sex This game is appropriate for kids 13 and up. The only real reasons that there would be any worry about kidss younger than that is the violence and language. The violence is only a problem for really young kids, like 7 or 8, where they might not realize that violence is bad. Its not really a problem for kids older than that because you don't have to use violence and its usually encouraged that you don't. I think the language could be a problem for people younger than 13 because while they probably hear and use worse language, the use of it in video games just reinforces it even more. I think thought that at 13, kids really don't think anything in video games should affect the way you act. The only thing I really don't think is a problem is the sexual content. It says that its there, but even if a kid did think that video games could be taken as real life, there wouldn't be anything to desensitizr them. Great game for teenagers"
a,"milder than most This game has many different things that could be considered inappropriate, but in milder ways than other games. For example, it has violence, but it doesnt even have to be ussed. It also has language, but its only used by enemies, in battle, meaning your not even paying attention to it. It has drinking, but it just makes the game harder, encouraging not to do it. Its also rated M for sexual content, but there really is none so it doesnt matter. all in all good for 12 and up"
a,"good game Anyone whos says that this game is violent is stupid. You don't have to use any violence if you don't want to, and when you do it really not that bad. Also, the sex. honestly, there is absolutely no actual sex related content in the game. You can be around people or things that relate to sex, but since you don't actually do anything sexual in the game, i don't think it should really affect anyone. The only problem is language, which is there, but still not as bad as gamkes like black ops. So if your kid is under 11 or 12, then the language would be a problem but otherwise, its not bad."
a,"13 and up This game is very interesting, because it does not require that the player uses any violence. Even when the player does choose to use violence, like in most games, there is blood, but its really just a quick spray that is there is then's gone two seconds later. There is also some language, and if your kid is below 13, it's inappropriate. But honestly, teenagers hear worse from others,and probably say worse in one hour than you do in the entire game. There are also drugs and drinking, but personally, i don't believe that that sort of stuff affects children. An d even f it did, then there would be very few drug addicts out there because of all those ""above the influence commercials"" all in all, a very good game appropriate for 13 year olds and up"
a,"Not just another futuristic shooter. Playing this game, I wished several times that there was an option to turn off some of the swearing, since it felt unnecessary. The game can be played non-violently, and when done that way, there are ample opportunities for you as a player to make choices about how your character will handle both conversations and potential fighting situations.
I think that some of the philosophic issues raised in the game can make for good discussion, but that would require your kids to be interested in examining and discussing how different sets of morals and ideals can both seem valid, but also clash with one another.
Since there's no option to turn off blood or ease off on the language, I think the M rating is appropriate if you're not interested in watching or discussing the game with your kid. If you do like to talk about games with your kid, and enjoy a decent story in your games, you could go a few years younger, down to 14-15; in that case though, I'd say make sure to play the game yourself so you're familiar with the story enough to ask questions about how things are going."
a,"CSM over exaggerating again. Deus Ex Human Revolution is an futuristic rpg which follows the shoes of Adam Jensen. I originally played this on my Wii u a little while back and I decided to check it out again and it’s not that bad. There is violence but it’s not over the top like fallout which I have reviewed on CSM before. There is some blood and you can kill innocent people but there a consequences for you actions in this game. There’s some swearing and drug references but there’s not much sexual content at all. The only thing is some missions taking place in a brothel but NO sex. I still think it should be for teens since the messages are quite dark such as greed and corruption. CSM got it wrong, it definitely not 18+ but recommended for teens 14+. Adam is a good role model as well as he is trying to save the people he loves before it’s too late."
s,my vision is augmented. deus ex is a game about choices. play it.
s,"You're gonna burn, alright. Ever since the original Deus Ex released in 2000, it has been a standard for the RPG genre, and Human Revolution is no different. Although it is a simpler and more consumer-friendly rendition, its elements remain the same. Get this game!"
a,Good story and gameplay Deus Ex: Human Revolution offers a great story and gameplay. You can see a lot of blood if you kill with the takedown moves in the game. Anyway it is a great game play.
s,Very good game. Game is very well done. Just amazing.
a,"Fantastic RPG delivers a hard, moral, and sometimes mature game. REVIEW: (content info below)
The graphics are ok, sometimes tinged too yellow or making the protagonists shoulders appear extremely wide, but who cares when the game in question is so good the only thing you can complain about out the graphics (witch are not even that bad.) Dues Ex Human Revolution is one of the most interesting RPG games players are liable to encounter. It ousts the bobble headed cartoony ones and outshines even the more likable RPGs simply because of its difficulty and stealth forced gameplay. There is no such thing as a tank (class) in this game, this is a stealth RPG, something that is uncommon for the genre. The gameplay is enjoyable, suspenseful (especially on the harder difficulties where several bullets can spell your death. Ammo is rare, almost more so than weaponry, another element that forces a stealthy play style. If you get frustrated easily you may consider over looking this game due to the fact that you most likely will spend hours completing a single objective (a major one not minor.) Dues Ex grabs your interest with its unique gameplay, plot, and open world.
CONTENT:
While Dues Ex may be an enjoyable experience for a stealth or RPG oriented gamer, it does contain some questionable content. Language is common ranging from the overlooked ""danm"" to the jarring F bomb (the latter is much less frequent though) Violence isn't much of an issue, there is blood but its minimal. If your morally inclined to be non-lethal (like me, a paradoxical existence for any action gamer) you will be overjoyed that early in the game you are given the option between Lethal or Non-Lethal, though you may be forced to use lethal weaponry because of the lack of ammo, instead of pursuing the more difficult stealthy route. Sexual content is also an issue, while it is not a major problem, you will encounter some iffy dialogue or outfits (never to revealing.) The games bad content can be outweighed by its great gameplay, but the decision is up to the parents, I just advise."
a,"Great game for Teens This is a superb game with a fantastic and engaging plot.
Violence: 6.5/10 Game has lethal weaponry such as guns or non lethal weaponry such as tranquillizer rifles, and the player has the option to either knock out or kill their opponent. I'm only giving this 6.5 because this game focuses on stealth and skilled players can beat this game without having to knock out or kill anyone.
Sex: 3/10 You never see anyone having sex, but there are prostitutes in some areas, but you can't actually do anything dodgy. There is a hotel that has hot girls dancing around a pole in tight clothing, but nothing too revealing.
Profanity: 7/10 There are quite a few f*cks in this game as well as sh*t, damn, b*tch. I would say that a teenager would be able to handle this well though.
Drugs and drinking: 4/10 There is an option to buy and consume alcohol, and the screen goes fuzzy. Several people smoke in the game, but as this is in the future it is not revealed if they are smoking tobacco. In the game people who are augmented with cybernetics rely on a drug called neurophozeyne. If they do not take this drug for a long period of time their body stars to reject the augments, so I guess there is some dependence on drugs.
Difficulty: 4/10 The controls are fairly easy to pick up on. The stealth game play can be tricky at the start but you get better at it as you progress.
Overall rating: 4.5/5 I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The game play style is unique and I loved the RPG elements of it, allowing you to have several outcomes to a situation. Overall there are twelve different endings to the game, meaning there is lots of re playability. You can chose the style you play, run and gun or stealth. Great game about 25 hours long."
s,"This Game is Amazing Game Review
First of all this is a cinematic game which explores the themes of what it means to be human but the boss fights are screwed up.
Dear
Common Sense Media
You guys have no clue what the average 11 year old says on voice chat. Theres enough racist slurs you would think the KKK was recruiting throughout the servers and enough homophobic slurs for the Westboro Baptist Church to call them out on it.
This game has none of that. You have a cinematic story which you can choose how to advance it. You can talk a terrorist out of commiting the act of terror and let him run away or you can shoot him on the spot so why does it get a 17+ rating. Because you guys have no sense of what makes a good game just let the community review not you guys."
a,"wow why??? It's a fine not really fun .
There are full of violence , for example : kill himself , swearing and more ....
I played one stage and stopped the blood from disgust
There is swearing and sex have not seen
He smokes all the time try to write deux ex earns pictures and see how unbelievable smoking
Do not buy!!!!!!!"
a,"Difficult cyber-punk RPG requires brain power and patience. I must say this before anything else: be prepared for a lot of difficulty. Now that that's out of the way, the visuals are impressive, the style is cool, and the story is very fun. The difficulty is a step above most FPS game, but that's what makes it a great game. NEVER OVERRIDE SAVES!! If you're in a fix and you can't go back to a previous location, you will hate yourself, as did I. You have to be both subtle and stealthy. Be nice to people and they may open doors for you, instead of fighting a horde of cops in an enclosed area. Ammo is limited, and while health regenerates, but you have little to start with. There is also quite a bit of violence, including shooting, knocking people out, stabbing and blood (not excessive, but still noticeable) swearing (lots of f-ck, sh-t and damn) and plenty of smoking. There are many references to drugs, drinking, prostitution and porn, although you cannot be involved in any of these other than drinking. Over all, it's very fun, but also slow. You have be playing in two hour slots to feel immersed, but not obsessed. I have not completed the game yet, but it stands at a 7/10: Good. For the time being at least."
a,"Deus Ex My dad let me play this game, and i was pretty surprised he let me. But, the most mature aspect of the story in my opinion, is the story itself. It's a pretty dark future. People are augmented with machines and a terrorist, or extremist group of people called purists are against it. I haven't gotten too far, but i like how you can chose how you go through a mission. The game actually isn't too violent if you chose the stealth approach(Which is what i recommend, this game isn't just going into the enemy territory and shooting everybody, you lose ammo fast and health) A lot of strong language so this game is for mature players. But it's more than just a simple shooter, so consider letting your child try."
a,"Great game,but violent Great but a little violent game. Violence isn't really a issue in this game, there is blood but the kind of blood you would see in a Uncharted or Ghost Recon game. There is language,but not through the whole game, f--k is used a couple times,while bas---d, a**,and sh-t are used are peppered in the game. This game is rated M,but this game shouldn't be played by kids under 14."
s,"One of my faves, just clearing up another stupid error of CSM I pay very close attention to detail, there are ABSOLUTLY NO SEX TOYS LYING AROUND IN BROTHELS. Epic game besides that, every aspect of it amazes me, i even bought it twice for my console and my P.C"
s,"Deus Ex Hookers, strong language, minimal blood, bars, clubs, and gambling, but it's ok in my opinion."
a,"Violent,crude and profane. I got this game last year and still play it now but not frequently like last time.A great game with infinite possibility but just down the violence,down the language and you'll get an even greater game."
a,"Awesome RPG best for teens I have been playing this game like crazy (so i am not done with it yet) The game is amazing but there are a few things i have to tell you about first. This is a game for teenagers and adults the content in this game is not that bad. But the game is hard you have to be a good RPG player to be able to play this right. The story of this game will go over younger kids heads. So if your 9 to 12 year old kid asks you for this because he wants something fun to play say No. Know lets talk about the content in this game. Voilence is not an issue a little blood and gunfights nothing that you won't see in Call of Duty. Drinking and Drugs can be taken by Adam (the guy you play) but they are only things like Asprin,Painkillers,Wine and beer so nothing that big of a deal. Swear words are hear and there but nothing you wouldn't hear in school. Sexual Content is kinda iffy There are prostitutes who say some bad dialogue there are strip clubs and sexual dialogue. But overall Deus Ex is a great game and if you are a serious gamer you should check this out."
a,"Superb RPG with Plenty of Action and Mature Content Deus Ex Human Revolution is an exciting, action-packed role-playing game. The game contains blood mist and stains from fallen enemies. The player is able to use multiple weapons to kill enemies from pistols and SMG's to plasma rifles and grenade launchers. That being said, the player is always given the choice to kill and can play through the entire game without killing anyone (bosses excluded). In fact, players are rewarded for doing so with double XP and an achievment. There is plenty of swearing in the game, including s*it and f*ck. When it comes to the game's sexual content, rest assured the player cannot engage in sexual activity, however you can talk to prostitutes and they say sleazy things such as ""would you like the special, it's worth every penny"" etc. There is a level where you enter the city from the rooftop of a brothel and have to make your way down the floors past pole dancer's and women in skimpy clothing. There has been mention of a sex-toy on a bed in the brothel, i didn't see it, but i don't doubt it's there. The main antagonist Adam Jensen is shown smoking in multiple scenes and can consume alcohol causing the player's vision to blur. Drug consumption could be an issue for some as the player can use hypostim needles and painkiller's to increase health. Overall a great game that is good for mature kids over the age of 15. One of the best games of the decade.
*NOTE* The Australian classification for Deus Ex: Human Revolution is MA15+ for Strong themes, violence and sexual references.
Jester's Rating: 9/10"
a,"Don't bother with this game Lots of violence iin this stupid game. It was horrible. My rating: M for blood, Intense violence, and language."
a,"A fantastic title, but with some considerations. Fantastic game that anybody should get. However there are some pause moments you should know about:
Language is very foul, and I'm don't have the cleanest of tongues. I squirmed at the multiple F-bombs, and the context they used it in. If you child can handle it, then its no problem.
Violence- While there is absolutely no incentive to shoot anything, the same can be said when turned around, as you can shoot almost everybody and everything. I've tried to test how open-world the game is, and it is VERY open world, as you can shoot civilians, hostages, and police- even if it is strongly not recommended. Remember, if your child is very impressionable, the openness violence may be of concern to you.
Sexuality- almost non-existent. Yeah, some scantily-clad women say some, 'sexy' things to you, but it's not that bad. They are referred to as, 'working girls,' and you cannot engage sexual activity with any of them. This is the least of your worries.
Alcohol and drug use- I never really notice it, but you can consume beer and whiskey, and you can see people smoking. No biggie.
Role models- Kind of a karma system here- Adam Jensen can either be a hero, who puts the welfare of others ahead of self, never kills, and prefers to get in and out quietly without being noticed. Or he could go on a murderous rampage, be verbally mean and disconnected to everybody, and likes things violent. The good thing here is the grey -zone that many other karma games leave out. For example, Mr. Jensen here can be stealthy and nice, with a high moral value; BUT he prefers lethal weapons. See what I mean? You can choose how Adam behaves in this world.
Lastly the Story and theme of the overall game is AMAZING! It's a fantastic journey you NEED to experience! It deals with many moral issues, and has tonnes of exposition and story to dive into. You can feel the world around you, how people react to the things that are happening. In short, this game sucks you in and makes you feel like part of this world. You need to buy this game- after considering the above. You won't regret it."
a,"Very Good Game for a Mature Audience I think Common Sense Media was a little too lenient on their review, at least with the language. There are very frequent uses of f--k and s--t during gameplay (from enemies) and during cutscenes (from the main protagonist and others).
Otherwise I think Common Sense Media was accurate. There are bars and clubs in the game and the occupants flirt with each other frequently. And, yes, there are plenty of prostitutes in Human Revolution although in-game they are called 'Working Girls'. They do dress suggestively.
This game allows you to make many of Adam Jensen's (the main protagonist's) decisions for him, so it is largely up to you to decide whether his story is a good message and whether or not he is a good role model.
Overall I feel that Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a very good game for a mature audience."
a,"Good game, gore and language can be turned off. "
s,Amazing game Really great game with levels that excite and are awsome. Some bloody bits with some attacks.
a,"No one under 18 Extreme bloody sci-fi game only for adults.
Extreme Violence
Strong language(f--ker,sh-y,f--k,)"
a,"Thank you for the content and language filter!! This was a great game, I had the content filter on and it was very playable although there is still some questionable language for kids. This game might be ok for 15 and over but only under strict parental supervision to make sure the filter is on."
a,"To Be Honest.... Blood Comes out, Bad Words screaming out of the way, guns blazing.. First of, this is innapopriate for kids under 13, Its a third person shooter, Graphicly Intense, Amazing story... But I don't reccomend this for 13 and under... I don't even let my 9 year old son touch this game nor my 11 year old son too..."
a,"Definitely not for kids War, Drugs, Alien Hordes, Mass Murder of different species. Compared to call of duty a DEVIL game"
a,"this one was the best gears 3 is better than the first two, mainly because the campaign is longer than last time and it has even more insane action and extreme gore than the first two, and also, the big set piece shootout at the hotel at the end set the record for the longest and bloodiest shootout ever, hahahahaha, it lasted for an hour for cryin out loud. BRING ON GEARS 4!!!!!!"
s,"Smooth as Butter Effective use of an aging engine, upgraded to bring the 360 to it's knees. Plays as smooth as butter."
a,"Incredible, the best of the Gears Trilogy After playing the game from start to finish, I would have to say with my honest opinion that the game was absolutely incredible. Though very bloody and gory, just like the two before, Gears Of War 3 comes through and makes it's own name for itself with a fantastic story, brilliant characters and gameplay to match. I do recommend though that parents check out the game first if any of their children, 15 and under, want to play."
a,"LUV THE GAME. But for kids?... well, its rated mature not because of the Age, but because you need to be mentally mature to play it. I guess it really depends on who your kids are. Yeah, you can turn off the blood and gore but do your kids aren't dumb. They know a chainsaw would really decapitate a person. And don't get me wrong I'm a huge fan of the series and its innovative storyline, as well as smart mouth characters like Baird. But if you want to get this for your kids, turn off the strong language and gore when you go to the options menu. Caution, if you have rowdy kids that like fight or throw tantrums don't get it. Lol, it will only make them worse. Otherwise if your kids are well behaved and they aren't easily influenced, than shoot for the moon. But like I said in the title, theres a reason why they say the game is rated for a MATURE audience. Forget the age, it maybe cgi, but it looks real enough that it just might turn your stomach if your not used to seeing gorey movies/games."
a,"Very good game, but executions can be very graphic... Gears of War 3 is a very enjoyable game to play, that is if you are either old enough to purchase it or you are mature enough to handle the amount of violent content. Looking at some other reviews, I noticed that the Lancer chainsaw is mentioned frequently, but having played this game for a good amount of time there are a few other methods of executing characters that may be of interest to parents. Just to name a few other more extreme methods, there is a move were you rip off another player's arm and then beat them with it while blood is flying everywhere. Two other ways involve a bladed bow or gigantic meatcleaver to decapitate another person's head off. Finally, there is an execution were you jam a flamethrower into the enemy's stomach and then cook them from the inside out, while they are screaming from the incineration. Outside of the executions, the shotgun can turn players into chunks of meat if shot at too closely. There is quite a bit of strong language as well. I would say older teens would be fine, but I wouldn't buy or even play this game in front of younger children. As for adults, it is a very enjoyable game, with lots of replay value across the four modes of play. One of the best games I have played in a long time. I would recommend it over both Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Battlefield 3 as far as shooters go, especially when online as the Gears community is, in general, more mature and not quite as profane as the other two games' communities."
a,"Great sci-fi action game with EXTREME violence and profanity. Gears of War 3 is a great sci-fi action shooter with amazing graphics, yet the violence is extreme and brutal. You use machine guns, pistols, sniper rifles and other explosive devices to kill and dismember the hideous looking alien species, known as the Locusts, with bloody and gory results. You also use a chainsaw on your gun to gorily dispatch your foes at close range and blood graphically spurts on the camera. The profanity is frequent and strong, constant use of f**k, motherf**ker, s**t, and other crude remarks. The intense apocalyptic-like atmosphere which shows other soldiers fighting off the locusts really sets the violent tone in this game. AT LEAST for people 17 and up."
s,fact and fiction. i think yes it is violent but kids nowadays know the difference between fact and fiction.
a,Too dark for kids The game is definitely not for kids. I tested the game at E3 and found that there is a part in the game where you can play the demonic alien creatures and kill humans. I find that a bit dark for some 8 year old to play. I think it says something about our culture; we really are surrounding ourselves with some really dark stuff.
a,"Rip dom Good game, I played the game on hardcore, with the violences and the language trun on , my parents don't care what I play. The campaign is better than the second game and the graphics are more gory than ever. Gears 4 and 5 were shit, so I went back and played this. My dad didn't allowed me to play this game until now. Great game, but just don't buy 4 and 5, just play the first 3, best backward compatible game.
Rip Dom, he was my favourite character in the game, would always revive me when I was about to die in a hard spot in the game."
a,"I love this game I like the feature where you can turn the Languge/cursing &amp; Gore off, my parents let me play this aslong as i keep the Cursing/languge off"
a,good game. this game is great but there is quite a lot of swearing and violence. not for younger children but suitable for children above 11 or secondary school (KS3) age or above.
a,"Gears of war is awsome First of all it is a great game. It has a lot of swearing. So if your kid is mature and you let them see violence and hear bad words a 11 year-old could play it, I started then.The game has a 4 player campaign, the only gears game from 1-4. It has multiplayer mini games including capture the flag, guardian, and the classic gung-ho shooter where you get 1 life and try to obliterate the enemy called warzone, good for quick matches. It has a all new mode called beast mode as well to that hasn't been seen in gears 1 or 2. In this game you play has the locust and can control characters such as tickers, the basic drone, corpser, and the mighty berserker. no lambent unfortunately.KEEP READING IF YOU WANT A SOMEWHAT SPOILER. In the last 2 games the COG's ""gears"" as the soldiers have been battling the locust threat. Not tiny bug like creatures, but rather human like scaly entities lead by their queen. They have been living underground for as long as humans have and have been peaceful until e-day (emergence day). They started attacking about the time a substance that burns well called emulsion and is commonly referred to as ""miracle fuel"". In gears 3 you battle locust like always. However emulsion has a negative side, for some reason it's turning locust into lambent, explosive mutated locust that hate locust too and in several scenes you'll walk on too a battlefield and see them shooting each other. Ever hear the saying the enemy of my enemy is my friend? Not true you can't make a alliance with the lambent or the locust. They will shoot you."
a,"15+ for gore and blood So my mom agreed to the series because of the gore filter and language filter.(Yes it's real) but as I got about 30 minutes into the game and the firefights began to start, I noticed the gore filter doesn't turn off all the gore, only when you shoot enemies. There was one place I went to to pick up a gun and there was a person on the ground with blood near it with no head and a brain on the ground. I thought this was a one time thing but I kept seeing bloody corpses everywhere. For that reason, I sold the game to Gamestop because I don't like violence. The language is not a problem with the filter on but the gore and blood is still a problem. I was disappointed by this game and don't think children under 15 should play this. The most violent thing even with the filter on is the chainsaw aliens part. Even with the filter on, the violence is still there and you can't shield anybody from that. Don't buy this game for young children."
a,Awesome This game is really great. You can turn of filters so younger audience around 9-11 can play like me. If you use filters this would be A Teen rated game.
a,"Excellent but extremely violent game for ages 15+ Gears of War 3 is an excellent but very gory third-person shooter game. The player plays as Marcus Fenix, a man in search of his lost father, and other COGS, people who fight evil alien races known as the Locust and the Lambent.
Violence 10/10: Players will use shotguns, pistols, sniper rifles, mortars, machine guns and swords to kill thousands of alien, and in some modes, human enemies. Blood will visibly be shown when enemies are shot, and blood will begin to stain the walls and floor if the player is shot too many times. Stronger weapons may cause dismemberment if used at close range. Players also have the ability to perform a finishing move when enemies are injured, which may include tearing off limbs, decapitation, torching somebody's insides or crushing skulls. All of this is shown is realistic and graphic detail, but fortunately, this can be filtered out in the options menu.
Language 8/10: Players will hear frequent and sometimes strong language within the game, including f--k, mother f--ker, sh-t, a-shole, a-s, b-tch, h-ll, d-mn, and crap. Like the violence, strong language can be filtered out (I must note that only stronger words like f-ck, sh-t, and b-tch will be filtered, but in rare occasions, one of those words may be slipped.) God's name is used in vain quite a bit. One female character says to a male character that she's going to ""raise his voice an octave,"" which would be considered inappropriate in my family.
Sexual content 2/10: Very little throughout the game. However, there is a scene where there is trading, in which women are included. Also, an alien character, who actually looks very humans, has a tight shirt, making her breasts rather noticable. However, it is not portrayed in a sexual way.
Drugs/alcohol/smoking 1/10: One reference to ""beer,"" but nothing more.
Overall, an excellent game that I would recommend for ages 15+, due to extreme amounts of blood and gore, and frequent and strong language. If you are going to use the filters, I would recommend it for ages 13+."
a,"Great game for kids when gore is turned off Gears of War 3, what an amazing game!
I have finished this game and think it is great, but down to the review.
The game is extremely violent when the mature content is left on, but when the mature content (gore, coarse language) is turned off, then gears of war 3 can be a game that younger kids can enjoy, too. When gore is turned off, then the Halo franchise can be seen as a more violent game. But, if you have no problem with your child playing violent games, then by all means, get them this awesome game!"
a,"16&UP gears 1 2 and 3 are for ages 16 and up, my dad doesn't even let me play he says its way to bloody"
a,"Gears of War 3 This is a very fun game but there is a very realistic blood and gore, including strong language like fu*k, sh*t, son of a bit*h and stuff like that. However in the options menu you can turn the blood and gore and strong language. Then it could probably qualify as a T rated game."
s,good game My 9 year old brother loves this game! doesn't even scare him commonsense media over rates games!! i say 9+
a,"Great game It should be noted that all mature content can be disabled through the mature content section of the pause menu, without the censors on let's begin. First off this game is pretty over the top in terms of violence, it's a staple of the franchise. However in this game most of the enemies are Lambent, who are mutated locust (The main bad guys in the first two games) they are grossly disfigured (Huge heads, tentacles sprouting, etc.) and you kill them in the same ways that you do with Locust except for these guys the yellow chemicals spill out and the Lambent enemy explodes.
It should also be noted that the multiplayer has a steep learning curve (Not as much as the first two because this includes ""noob"" weapons such as the Sawed off and retro lancer) and the mostly late teens/adult community can get pretty mad if you are using those ""noob"" weapons (The weapons are pretty cheap) or if you aren't doing well. You can automatically mute players who are not your friends in the settings for your Xbox. Contact Microsoft if you can't figure it out.
This all sounds very gruesome and if you're unsure I'd recommend watching a gameplay video on youtube to decide for yourself."
a,Epic games makes aperfect finale to the gears Trilogy This game features tons of gore and explict languge but......... you can simply avoid all of that and enjoy this game with anyone 12 or over. At the begining of the game you simply go to settings and will find explict content turn of and youre ready to go. My only other concern is the main chararacter marcus rarely smokes a cigar
a,"Blood and Guts. Hoorah Gears of War 3 is the exciting conclusion to the Sci-fi trilogy of the Gears. Nothing is held back. Violence is used liberally throughout. Players are rewarded for performing extremely violent ""Execution moves"" and is required in some portions of the game to advance or earn achievements. Some examples are stepping on an enemy's head, ripping a chainsaw-bayonet down their shoulder, and dropping a Gatling Gun on them, smashing their spine. Language is also an issue. f**k , d**m, sh*t are used often in dialouge in the campaign. Both the aforementioned issues can be addressed with an option to reduce the violence and language. Blood from incoming fire or melee attacks are replaced with sparks, and no removal of limbs is depicted and harsher words are censored with static. It should be noted that the player is never directed to this option, and the blood and gore, and profanity is the default. Your child could also be exposed to uncensored conversation via multiplayer, which Gears emphasizes for teamwork in TDM or the famous ""Horde mode"". I would definitely not play this game if there was child under 12 in the room with me, even with the violence and language set to a minimum. (my little brother is fond of watching me, he especially enjoys the previously mentioned Gatling Gun execution). This game is not for the faint of heart, and the maturity of your child regarding serious violence should be addressed.
I personally found the story captivating and the game-play fun (if not incredibly violent). The game has an emphasis on teamwork, almost the entire game can be played in split-screen co-op. Altogether, its an excellent play. The creative multiplayer and survival modes will keeps friends occupied for hours on end with beautiful graphics, intense and frantic game-play (which has a somewhat steep learning curve if one bypasses the hints), and an adventurous soldier drama atmosphere that could put ""Band of Brothers"" to shame.
However, I would never recommend this game to someone who has a child under the age of 14 and I would make it a personal point to asses how you child thinks of excessive violence. Otherwise, this game can prove fun and challenging to High school age player. That split-screen co-op could also give you and your child a perfect opportunity to discuss the above issues, all the while pounding the Locust Horde into submission. A fantastic game for the mature player."
a,"Filter This game is perfectly described on the official review, but they forgot to mention there is not only a filter for language but also violence. the filter takes f-words, s-words and sometimes smaller words out. the violence is removed immensly, there is no blood with it and no gore."
a,"Love it or hate it,this is a must have for Xbox 360 fans. I wasn't planning on getting this game.In fact,I didn't even know it was out until a month after its release or so.Got this game with a Xbox 360 320 GB Hard Drive Limited Edition Console Bundle.I also have the Epic Edition of this game,but I got that by itself from Walmart.It is awesome,and the graphics are specially enhanced for 360 consoles.The blood may be relentless and nonstop but it's the fun that counts.Who likes a game for its gore?Overall,a must have for Xbox fans."
a,"Gore, blood, language, intense violence, need I say more? This game is extremely gory, and bloody. You hear f*** almost every 2 minutes, I have to agree this is intense. But, older teens should be able to handle it."
s,"video games lessen the gore factor Honestly, video games in my opinion, are never overly violent like movies are. I think much more people can handle violence in video games than in movies. Never played it, but I know a lot of kids way under my age do, and aren't squeemish about it."
a,"Cole Train's in the house! Honestly this game is a masterpiece. It has great story, memorable characters and an engaging conflict. This game is EXTREMELY bloody and gory, but the game comes with features to disable blood, same thing for swearing. No beer, vodka any of that stuff. The characters are engaging and the ending is a great fate to this amazing franchise."
s,"Kirby Mass Attack Kirby Mass Attack is an action-adventure game with lots of very vague cartoony violence. Your team of little Kirbys (smily pink puffballs) pile on their enemies and battle them, though the actual fighting is depicted as nothing more than a whirring of arms and feet. Defeated Kirbys turn into ghost/angels and begin to float away, but they can be grabbed and brought ""back to life."" There is some strategy involved in deciding how to use your many Kirbys, and the game encourages experimenting. Recommended for ages 3-8 years"
s,fun but different than the other kirby games in this kirby game there is no sucking up enemies still fun game and i recommend it
a,"Meh. Just Meh. Well... This game is kinda hard to make, i guess. but to me, it's just a boring, Average, Fine game... Im giving this a violence rating, because of all the pummeling."
s,Kirby strikes again A great game
s,"CSM left out two questions parents can ask their kids. and those questions are, ""do you or did you used to play sports?"" and, '''if so, have you or did you ever hear your coach say the phrase ""there's no 'I' in team?'''
the reason parents can ask their kids these questions is because this game has the right message about what the phrase ""there's no 'I' in team"" means all over it. Plus, kids can learn the importance of teamwork. not just its importance in sports, but in other jobs like being a police officer."
s,"Double the Kirby, Double the fun! This is one of the best games ever! Kirby has been zapped by Necrodeos and has transformed into 10 Kirbys! They destroy everything! There is a unlockable DS Download Play and DS Wireless Play where you can play with friends as well. At the end of the game you do end up ripping Necrodeos' tough out to turn to one Kirby again, but it's not very noticeable."
s,"Good game - never tried online mode I've played this a few times by myself and with close friends. I really enjoy it and there are obviously things that you and your kid could talk about such as teamwork and good sportsmanship when you lose (controlling your temper). You can also play together. I've never tried any online modes so I can't speak as to the security of that part of the game. One great thing about it is that there is a manager mode (if that's something that interests your kid) where you can be in control of how the money is spent, what players to buy and sell, and what players play in each game."
s,FIFA! Inspiring. A+ all around.
s,"Best soccer game I've ever played! This is the best soccer game out there, in my opinion. There is no violence whatsoever (kicking the ball away from the opponent does not count as violence because that's necessary to play soccer). Fifa 12 is pretty easy to play, and it is fun overall. I do have to say that you should watch out for consumerism (banners in the stadiums promote companies) but other than that, this game is awesome!"
s,good game good game but there is a lot of money involved in career mode but its easy to play
s,"Everyone will love this game! We love this game! There is easy controls, and is a bucketload o' fun! Consumerism is noticeable, but this game teaches you, practically, how to play soccer."
s,"Improvements Finaly no more magical A button or on ps3 X button defending
the tricks actually work
sometimes the impact engine glitches but overall it adds realism to the game
Well known players play like they do in real life
But if you are like the review by P33zHeer and hate the new defending, there is the option to go back to the old defending"
s,"Great Game :) The game is all football no violence although there is slide tackles,stand tackles and pulling shirts. I am under 13 so I can't access the online features but I could on FIFA 10 and there was privacy so I don't think that has changed."
s,"Flawed? FIFA 12 let me down. Tactical Defending is great but all the other controls are awful! The switch player never works right and I emit more swears than a cowboy whos just fell over into a bucket of pins. The career mode and ultimate team are better than ever but the actual gameplay can irritate you if you don't get used to it quickly. Apart from that, not bad. FIFA 11 was better, but its not as bad as the early 'new gen' FIFAs."
s,FIFA Soccer 12 FUN GAME! I absolutely love it!
s,Suitable for EVERYBODY Amazing Game! Suitable for any age.
s,Great game 
s,NBA 2K12 Review This is a really good game nothing bad about if your kids like basketball they will really like this game because it is super fun and they will really enjoy the game and get some good role models from it as well
s,"NBA 2K12 is a masterpiece sport game Really good game that is really educative, and with some positive messages. The New Player Mode is really good, the gameplay is fun etc..."
s,"Great game This is a great game! In the beginning it is hard to get used to the controls, but after a while it's really simple. There is really nothing bad about this game and can help you with basketball."
s,Best Basketball Game Ever 
s,Amazing The BEST forza game EVER!!
s,"Amazing Game! This game is amazing. I started playing Forza when I was 3! Kids can play on Single Player, not Multi-Player. I've played online and there's one person.. (It was on FM5) He was just a little annoying troller and people including me lashed out at him.. His rep! Hahaha.."
s,AMAZING This game does not have unrealistic crashes. THERE IS A SETTING FOR COSMETIC DAMAGE AND REAL DAMAGE TO YOUR CAR it has great graphics and I love it
s,"I wake up early on the weekends to play this game. Great for any fan of racing, beautiful graphics and amazing cars. This game is an amazing game except for the fact that you have to purchase most car packs like the Porsches. Very fun game to play by yourself or with one other, but the offline multiplayer is only up to 2."
s,Forza 4 Absolutely amazing no violence at all. Awesome!
s,"this game is for all ages, but need to stay of game chat. its a great game. the quality of the game is outstanding. full 1080p. ive been playing this game for a year. id say this game is great for all ages.
the game has a lot of cars. and is expanding every month. but every car costs like 240 microsoft points. (aka 3 bucks) the multiplayer is amazing also. its got drift, car tag, soccer, and more. but when your playing multiplayer it has open chat and of course some of the people are not friendly. so id say for younger kids should turn off voice chat. thats all i say for parental review. and for people who play halo can get the halo warthog in autovista mode. so this game is one fo the best driving game ive played in my life."
s,Good Racing Game. 
s,fantastic game highly recommend it!! amazing game!! the graphics are so amazing if not the best! no violence apart from cars bumping into each other and i suspect most 15 year old's should be able to handle that!! only rated it a 6 because any younger would have difficulty playing
s,"awesome awesome graphics, neat game!"
s,"my experience with the game there is no violence besides crashing and there is no blood, cursing or fire but it can be a little hard it also teaches kids about flags and countries"
s,"Ok For Anyone Forza 4 is a great game that is fine for anyone. If you don't want your kids to play online, then just cancel Xbox Live! If you don't want them to crash, encourage slow driving without opponents!"
s,WOW Amazing graphics and stunning scenery.Loads of cars to choose from.With this game u will never get tired!
s,"It's a OK Hello!
Let me put this to you straight and simple. Skyrim is about exploration and fantasy. I bought this game because my 15 year old wanted it for his birthday. When he put it in his system I decided to watch him play. The game was fantastic! I have never seen anything like it before. However at the time my 13 year old also wanted to play it. I told him he would have to let me see the game played longer by my 15 year old. I have to say after watching my son play the game I told my other son to come in. I told him it would be okay to play because of the fact that Skyrim is such a big game that I seriously doubt that my 13 year old will get to see every bit of the game. The sexual content is at a minimum, The blood is similar to the Halo games, and the drinking thing is just silly. Thank you for reading this review and I hope it helped :) Peace"
a,"First user review not written by either a troll or a younger teen. Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to tell you about Skyrim, what it is, what it is about, and the different themes associated with it.
Skyrim is the next installment of Bethesda Softwork's award-winning Role Playing Game series, The Elder Scrolls. It is a game in which a person takes control of a character of their own design (anything from brave Nordic warrior to Cat-Person.) One traverses the open world of Skyrim in search of fame and glory through combat, trade, errands, and diplomacy. I feel that ""pause for 13"" is a worthy rating for this game, as while many 13 year-olds can certainly handle many of the game's mature themes, it is not always a given.
Let us look through the stuff here, shall we?
Educational:
Believe it or not dear reader, this game can actually teach a player a good deal about conserving money and bartering, as in the game the character can make many decisions about what to buy, where, and for what reason. This is helped as different stores and vendors offer things at different prices. The player's vocabulary of fantastical words will also be increased, as they will learn words like ""tome"" or ""necromancy"". Not that they are particularly useful words or anything.
Role models: The main role-model in the game, is actually the player themselves. They can decide to, ultimately, if they want to smash in the head of an innocent civilian or not. As most games, combat against other blood-thirsty warriors and great beasts is required to play and win the game, but it is up to the player if they want to be a paragon of righteousness and help the weak, or be a really, really big jerk.
Violence: The game almost revolves around violence, but not as much as a game like Call of Duty. The player can choose several different methods of battle to defeat a foe, everything from giant-axe brutality to spewing a torrent of fire out of their hands. As could be expected, the goal of all methods is to kill one's opponent, but magic I have seen is notably less bloody than melee combat. Players can expect to see corpses, skeletons, and mutilated bodies throughout the course of the entire game.
Sexual themes: Minimal but still present. The occasional bit of innuendo here, some cleavage. Characters can appear with most clothing off, this being men in loincloth and girls in their undies.
Language: Not as bad as most games. No F-bombs or swearing in ""the name,"" as it takes place in another world entirely. The ""D"" word and the ""B"" word are common place however. Basically any swear that can sound alright said in medieval times.
Themes: It can get pretty strong in this game. Many a time will the player be forced into hard, morally difficult or confusing situations. There is, if the player decides to peruse some schools of magic, a good deal of summoning, the collection of the souls of enemies, and other dark ideas in general.
Addictive factor: Skyrim is an incredible game. It is almost endlessly immersive, and can hold a person's attention for months, literally. There is so much to do and see in the game that there are some people who have played a single character for hundreds of hours in the previous game, Oblivion, just to enjoy all that there is to offer. It goes without saying that Skyrim has even more content, and can utterly consume the life of the player if they have nothing else to do. Be sure your child is not overly-imaginative in the way that they would blur fantasy and reality together, as this is one of those games.
Overall: Skyrim is an excellent game for anyone who can take the mature themes and still enjoy them, along with playing it in moderation. If not, it could lead to an escapist attitude toward life in general, as the player would much rather play Skyrim than enjoy the charms of reality. Be sure to know your child if you allow them to play it."
a,"The Actual Truth From a Hard Core Gamer Some of these reviews are obviously made by parents that just kind of glanced at it while the kid played, so here's one from someone who has spent over 120 hours playing it. This game is probably something I'd even play around kids, but not something I'd let them play by themselves until they got a little older depending on their curiosity level. The reason why being exactly how immersive this game truly is. I've been playing this game since it came out back in 2011 (it is currently 2019 while I make this post) and I have still not seen everything there is to see in the game. Now, that makes for a terrific game, but it also makes it very difficult to put a real rating on it. You are never confident that the kids will not find something that is truly not for the eyes of children. The main story line, which is something kids are likely to stick on, has violence and smash talk, and that is it. The violence is unrealistic (you see blood, but it...just play the game, you'll see what I mean) and mostly directed towards creatures that are considered evil and you find main characters slaying in children's fairy tails - skeletons, dragons, ghosts, vampires, etc. However, two of the guilds have frequent killing of actual playable races and your character is also kind of forced to choose a side in the civil war (insert more smash talk). These people are also considered evil. Everything else, you have to seriously look for.
Sexual content: getting married, there is none. Playing the game, there is none. Curiously running around all the holds and collecting books for your library, however, and you can pick up books that have erotic literature. The most well known of these being the book ""The Lusty Argonian Maid"". So like I said, depending on how curious your child is and how likely they are to truly look around and immerse themselves in the lore, this game might not be for them.
The swearing in the game is pretty much just lore. They don't say the F bomb, but are likely to call other races names because of the blatant racism. These names are all kid friendly, like ""cat"" and ""lizard"". You might get the S word of the D word every once in a while, but they are few and far between, and let's be honest...you can talk to your kid about language a lot easier than some other things we'd like to shelter them from.
The drug in the game is skooma. Unless they really looked into the lore, they're not likely to even understand it's anything but juice. The previous games in the elder scrolls series is actually what made me know that skooma was an illegal drug, because the previous games are much more obvious about it. Skyrim, however, is not. You just kind of find it and somewhere along the line hear ""maybe don't try to sell that stuff"". End of drugs. The alcohol is a lot more prevalent. You can walk into breweries, pick up ale, etc. There is one quest where you get drunk and had a wild night, but everything is just kind of hinted and you don't actually witness anything bad.
I hope this makes it easier to decide. I would've been able to play this game at 8 years old and never even come close to seeing any of the things I mentioned today. Mostly because 8 year olds don't realize they can run away from the main story line and play side stuff. It's likely to go straight over their heads. But for some kids who are a little more mature and curious? Perhaps wait until they're in high school."
a,"Amazing game! Not for ages 14 or below. I am 17 years old, and I have been playing skyrim for about a year now. It is by far one of my favorite games, and perhaps Bethesda's greatest work yet. It has tons of quests and story lines that change your game completely, your every action affecting your outcomes. That being said, I do not find it appropriate for children or even young teens. While some gameplay can be safe for a younger audience to watch, there are many quests that can warp a child or young teen. You may not see this in the beginning of the game, or even in the first 10 or so hours. Draugrs, for example, may frighten children under 12. They are like walking mummies in the movies, only more graphic. Dark brotherhood quests can be extremely disturbing, and could honestly bother some 15 or 16 year olds. It is rather violent, given the fact that you can kill just about anyone in the game, and there are many you must kill. The game may seem okay when for younger gamers when you're just above ground, killing wolves, but when you start exploring tombs, keeps, and other complex quests, there is too much content that is not at all appropriate. There are entire quests centered on necromancy, or raising the dead, for example. These types of quests make up the entire game, so please consider that. Also, there is torture in the game. The dark brotherhood has their very own torture chamber, complete with torture victims. I believe there are other quests with torture, but I have not gotten to those yet, as there are hundreds of quests. The language is very mild, but there is some. That is up to the decision of the parents on how appropriate the language is. There is some drinking, but no more than what is seen in real life. Each town has a drunk or two. There is a drug, skooma, which your character can become addicted to. It is sold by khajiits, taken from bandits, prisoners, ect. Skooma is also illegal in skyrim, so it represents real drugs. There are a couple of references to bondage and some scantily clad women, but there is not too much obvious sexual content. There is one mission in riften where the dragonborn must find a woman's married sexual partners and confront her about them. In the quest, you can find a note labeled ""until next time"" vaguely and laughably describing one of her encounters. You can also find a book by her bedside called ""the lusty argonian maid"" which is sarcastic and most children would not understand it. I do not find this game at all suitable for children 14 and under. If your child is under 11, I would not suggest allowing them to see you, or their older siblings, playing this game. Ages of 15 and 16 are arguable, and parents should carefully decide whether their child is mature enough for it at those ages. Also, if your teen has a violent nature, you may want to bring that into consideration. It is rated M for a good reason, and while it may seem innocent at first, there are far too many things that can be seen in the hundreds of hours of gameplay that are not for kids. However, for older teens, given they are mature, it can help to increase decision making skills. Many of the events are references to actual historical events and people. It may help to bring a better understanding of history and society. Be careful if your teen is easily immersed, because even I find myself wanting to press a button to collect a flower or mushroom, or holding up my ""magic"" if I get startled. It is very easy to get lost in skyrim, feeling like it is reality. Overall Skyrim is an amazing game, but please wait until your child is 15 before even considering it for them. Again, some content in skyrim is fine, but there are a lot of quests that would be terrible for a child to stumble upon. If you aren't willing to go through at least 50 hours of gameplay to figure this out, please do not ignore the rating system and reviews of people who have played much of the game. And do not listen to reviews of kids who should not even been playing this game. Most of them haven't played enough to know all of the content."
a,"Accurate skyrim review. In's and out's! I find a lot of the other reviewers have inaccurate reviews with things written that aren't very true. This is the best game I have ever played and I think people need to play this but need accurate info about it first.................
Sex-First of all I have never seen any nudity or sex depicted and can't think of one time when there was even a reference to sex. You can get married in the game. Also I know that if the game is being played on a PC there are mods available that make NPCs nude but that would have to be sought out then installed to actually see. Overall sex and nudity is a 0/10.....................
Drugs/ Alcohol- the use of drugs and alcohol is very minimal. I've ran into a skooma dealer twice in my 650+ hrs of gameplay. Also there is one quest where you can go into a cabin in the woods and see people under the influence of it. Also there is wine or mead or ale for sale at some places but the only quest where you can actually get drunk is where you have a drinking contest. Overall anything involving drugs or alcohol is such a minimal part of the game that it is barely noticeable. 2/10 at worst................
Swearing - swearing is barely noticeable as there is only about 3 swear words through the entire game and even then it's only words like d*mn, sh*t, and b*tch instead of c**t, c**k, or f**k.....................
Magic/occult/gods - there is extensive use of magic in skyrim and it would be hard to do anything in skyrim without seeing one of these things. On the other side of this you don't have to use magic yourself and don't have to become a vampire or a werewolf. You could also play the game as a good Mage or a person that fights evil creatures and makes the world better. There are many quest that involve magic or occult but many are avoidable. Overall this category is 8/10 this category only really matters to religious people though or people that want to avoid these type of things................
Violence - violence is unavoidable in almost every quest although most of the time you can chose to only do quest where you kill monsters and animals not humans. Also blood can be turned off in the settings or less violent methods can be used in the game such as ice spells instead of swords and ""shouts"" (Fus Ro Dah) (Yol) instead of bows. Overall Violence is 7/10 normally and 3or4/10 if you avoid killing humans and use less violent methods..................
Morals- this is where it gets difficult. Depending on the path you choose the morals could be a good influence or a bad. For example you could join the dawnguard and keep the world free from vampires and save people or you could become a vampire lord yourself and kill people yourself. Also there are some pretty gritty quests like the ring of nimira quest that has to do with cannabilism and the dark brotherhood quest line... Although I think that in both cases you can chose to appose and destroy these organizations/cults or join them. I know that I have done a play through as a good character and as a bad one making completely different decisions. I think that this really depends on the kid that is playing and how mature they are. Overall I would rate morals 5/10...............
OVERALL - skyrim can be pretty gritty at some points but can often be avoided. Sex and drugs are extremely minimal. If you play the game like its meant to then its 6.5/10 for overall 'badness' but this can be tamed in many ways and be lowered to 4/10. This game really isn't that bad for any mature kid over 10. Also kids (or adults) with addictive personalities are probably best to stay away from this game or at least have their time monitored as it is one of the most addictive games I have ever played or that I know of. It has taken years from my life playing it over and over again. (I know I have at least 650 hrs+ on separate machines and have friends that are even worse than me).................
I hope this review helped you make an informed decision and sorry for any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors as I'm writing this pretty late at night. Ps. This game is meant to have a 5 star rating but my ipad is glitching and will only let me do 4 star for some reason. :)"
s,"Relax its fine for kids This game is kinda violent but this is not realistic like call of duty. In call of duty you are killing other humans, while in skyrim you are mostly killing other creature but not with guns and all that. This game is fine for kids."
s,AMAZING!!!!!! I Love this. My ten year old son and I will always sit down with him and watch him play it. I love the gameplay. Its Fine. Not 18+
a,"Great for almost teens and up! I was sceptical about letting my child play a 18+, oh was I surprised why it was rated 18+ it has barely anything bad in it! Just the Violence which if your kid is not scarred by these things it’s 100% fine for them! That’s why I think anything under 12 would get scared by the violence but if your child is mature enough it’s fine.
And that Alcohol things is absolute rubbish!
But really going from one parent to another this is fine to let your 12+ kid play."
a,"Vanilla is great for kids but be careful of adult mods. The game as is fine for kids, mods on console are also fine. But if your child has his/her own PC be careful of mods that are off an adult nature. When I say this under stand this has nothing to do with the game developers as anyone can add anything to the game if they know how. Literally anything. Nude body mods, ultra violence, new dialogue containing swears or even sex animations. So make sure your child isn't installing those mods. The Nexus mod site has plenty of family friendly mods so don't freak out if your kid wants to mod the game just be sure YOU read the mod description first and know what's being added otherwise what ever has been said by other parents here won't matter as it will have a completely different rating depending on what's been added."
s,"13+ WARNING! This game is not bad at all!
Okay, for this game, you may say ""Oh, I won't let my kid play that, just because it is rated M!""
Well, you're wrong.
This game, in itself, is not bad. The only thing that will actually be bad for a child is violence. If your child has played any Battlefield or Call of Duty game (rated t versions, Like Bad Company or World at War), they will not blink at this game. I will give the ESRB some slack. They have to take in to account everything that can harm children. Ever had your kid watch Lord of the Rings? Well, in the game, there is a drinking contest playable. The sex? Girls wear shirts, and somebody mentions it a few times. The Violence and Gore? Unless your kid is queasy, they will not even be affected by this. The gore level is very low. The blood? Not a big deal. I am a parent that is very over protective, I will admit it. Before this, my child has only played rated T games. In all honesty, this is heis first taste. He is thirteen. I have been very against blood and killing, because I think that it will affectmy kid's morality. He may think that killing is not a bi deal, or any thing that is bad. But this game, it FROWNS upon killing. Yes, that is right. It punishes you for killing. Your character can be arrested or killed in punishment, and it will affect the happiness of people around you. People that are in the game can stop trusting you as well. This game is so dense, it will blow you away. I bought it, and I played it a week before I let my son try. He loved it. If you have a mature 13 year old of an immature 15 year old, they can handle it, even if they are looked upon as your little baby. Buy it. They'll love it. I am saying this from a strict parent stand point. I would never let my kid play if I had not sampled it, but compared to madern war games, The blood level is low. MW3? GORY!!! Ask your kid if they have played those. If they have, this game will be perfect for them. If they want it, then get it. It is a great game, and it is acceptable for teens. This site frowns upon anything. Both Batman games and the entire Uncharted series are listed at 16. I would let my 8 year old boy play them. He loves super heroes, and he likes the Uncharted games. BUY IT! IT IS VERY ACCEPTABLE!!!"
s,"Moral Decisions: Scary, but Important Among the games of today Skyrim is the rarest kind of jewel. It is an experience that should be had by anyone who loves video games, and the story-line, moral choices, character development, atmosphere, and sheer gorgeous beauty of the world you are exploring make this game one of the best I have ever played. As a hard core gamer all of my life, I look at this game as a once-in-a-decade occurance. It is unique, it is individual (a very rare thing in games that are becoming increasingly fixated on only the multiplayer experience) and it is beautiful.
But that's not the point. I am a young adult, after all, and this game, as a M Rated game, is targeted towards me and middle to older teens. Is this game appropriate for children? In some ways possibly more so than most M rated games. In other ways, it is not so much inappropriate as perhaps over younger children's heads.
This game is a very difficult game. It has difficulty settings, of course, but the complexity of the world and the problems the character is presented with, the sheer vastness of an entire land to explore and dozens of quests to fullfill, make this game a likely bewildering experience to many children younger than 12, and only if those twelve year olds are experienced or fairly experienced gamers. There is a way of thinking that goes along with experience with games, and they will need critical thinking skills, trial and error, patience, and technical skill to be successful at this game. While it is extremely rewarding to wander into the wilderness of Skyrim, weak and practically defenseless and without knowing anything about the world you are entering, I entered that world as an experienced and confident gamer, and suspect that the experience would be overwhelming to younger children who do not have much experience with video games. There are just so many things to do, become, try.
Which brings us to the moral choices dilemma. It is true that in Skyrim, you can choose to become anything from the noblest man or woman to ever walk to earth, to the lowest, cruelest, piece of scum. There are many levels of gradation, unlike many games in which the good/evil moral choice aspect is presented in a way that makes you either totally good or absolutely bad. For example, you could choose to save a man from a bandit's onslaught, and yet pickpocket random people on the street. You can donate your money to homeless beggars, and then join an assassin group and kill for money. There are many moral choices in this game. To many to count. And that is why I think, in the end, this game is better than a game in which you are forced to play by default, a completely good hero or a mean antihero (as in the Grand Theft Auto games).
The kind of moral choices in Skyrim can seem scary. After all, what if your child chooses to play as the worst kind of character, a merciless killer, who would kill innocent men and women on the street to rob them of their money? First of all, the fighting in this game is far less violent than most games now days. There is a little spurt of blood, and then the body falls, completely intact (unless it is beheaded, and even then, the animation is nothing that most 12 year olds haven't seen worse of in movies or on TV). Some people I know play the game in this way and find in enjoyable. But many other people find an excersize in morality, as they try to become a genuinly good person and make decisions that will benefit those around them. It means more to be a hero in Skyrim, because you can choose not to. IT means more to choose not to lie, to choose to help someone who needs it, to choose to make a character who embodies some aspect of how you would hope to live. But at the end of the game, the character is just a character and the world is just a world. RPG's can teach us things about ourselves, and Skyrim is one such obsticle course through which we can practice steering our morality.
So this is my recommendation:seriously question whether this game is appropriate for your child if they are under 13 and not an experienced gamer. However, if the kid is 16 and older, this game might just end up being their favorite game ever."
a,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim This is a fantasy role-playing game in which players assume the role of Dovakin, a prophesied figure with the power to combat dragons in the fictional world of Skyrim. As players traverse through mountainous ""open-world"" environments, they complete missions and quests that impact the eventual fate of their character. Players use swords, bows and arrows, axes, and magic attacks (e.g., fireballs, ice shards) to kill various enemies (e.g., wolves, dragons, human bandits and soldiers). As players engage in melee-style combat, some sequences are highlighted by slow-motion effects, particularly for decapitations. Large blood-splatter effects also occur during combat, and some environments are stained with blood or body parts (e.g., heads impaled on spikes). Some sequences allow players to injure/kill nonadversary characters, including prisoners chained to a wall; they scream in pain amid splashes of blood or fire. As the game progresses, the dialogue and on-screen text contain references to sexual material (e.g., “. . . all the whores your heart, or any other organ, desires,” “She . . . raped the men as cruelly as Bal had ravished her,” and “Remember when you thought [he] was . . . intent on making you . . . into his personal sex slave?”). Alcohol such as wine, mead, and ale can be purchased and consumed by players' character throughout the game; in one sequence, players can engage in a drinking contest with another character, which eventually results in slurred speech (e.g., “One more. No problemsh . . . Thash grape!”)."
s,"Great for 12 and up! This is a fantastic game. I have watched my 12 year old play it and it seems amazing, I don't know how this got rated 18+. Any teenager can play this and most 12 year olds can play it. The main thing is the violence. There are axes and swords and magical things, lots of battle, nothing crazy, though. The violence is similar to the level of The Lord of The Rings. Some people are talking about sexual content, that's hardly an issue, sexual content is very low. The worst you can find is mild innuendo. You may find some people half naked but it's pretty much like being at a pool. If your child has been to a pool then the sexual content isn't a problem. The language isn't bad, not anything a 12 year old doesn't know in fact most 10 year olds actually use the language. The worst I found was the 'D' word. Some people say that there is a 'B' word somewhere in the game, didn't find that, though. It's also an amazing game, the graphics are beautiful, fun quests, big world to explore lots of nice towns and cities, wherever you go there's always something fun, the story is great, too. There is also some alcohol but that's hardly an issue. There is beer and wine but what 12 year old has never heard of that. Drugs are also present. There is a fictional drug in the game called Skooma or something, nothing bad, though. I'm sure all kids know what drugs are.
Basically the only thing you need to worry about is the violence, if your child is afraid of dragons and has nightmares from scary things then it's not for them.
If your child goes to school then they know all of the above, I've heard kids making violent jokes and things like that. A great game for 12 and up. Buy this game for your teenager/preteen! They will love it! I rate this 5/5"
s,"this game is totally overrated and appropriate to anyone 11 and above This game is not at all violent the only blood or gore that you get is when you are fighting but it disappears very quickly, if I were the manager of this game it would only be like an 11+ issue. And there is very very mild sexual content. And the kind of sexual content you do here is just about marrying and leading a happy life with your life partner."
s,"not bad this is an amazing game with not much violence, all it is is a hit then spray of obviously fake blood. There is no sex, only the occasional talk about it, and even that's hard to find. there is nothing remotely wrong with this game, and anyone over 12 should be allowed to play it"
s,Ok for 13 and up. This is a very fun game. It is very entertaining and can also be educational. In this game you have the freedom to make choices. Know your kid. If you have a mature responsible kids over the age of 12 it should be fine. There is nothing I wouldn't trust my 12 year old with. There is violence and very small amounts of sexual content. But it is very rare and is very mild. Nothing kids this age can't handle.
s,"One of the best games of All time It’s a great game, that discourages killing, stealing, and hitting people. This game has swearing but the swearing is the same as you would see in a PG movie. The gore is very fake. The violence is hitting enemies, who attack or steal from you. This game has loads to do and it’s very fun"
a,Showing pickpocket is bad to my toddler I think my toddler is smart she is 4 I showed her pickpocket is bad in Skyrim and there are consequences now she's pickpocketing at school make sure you tell your kids not to pickpocket for fun!!
s,"An Honest Review From A Mother of 2! So, this game is rated M for Mature. That's wrong on so many levels.
My son, 15 at the time, asked me if he could buy this game. Now, I looked at it and was a bit skeptical so I did a bit of research. He got the game the next day. Relax, this game is fine for kids.
If your child has matured past fifth grade I think this game will be fine. It is a violent game, yes, but nothing worse that the Lord of The Rings series. Most of the time you are slaying beasts and not humans.
This game does have some swears hidden in there, but nothing your child hasn't heard before. If you let your kids watch Marvel superheroes movies they'll be able to handle this no problem.
Drugs and alcohol? It's a fantasy game, of course there'll be potions and ale, things you often see in teen rated games.
And, of course, the adult content. Probably the main reason parents are skeptical about this wonderful game. However, my boys have played this game countless times and I've even watched then play some, and we've never seen anything not safe for young boys. I did a bit of research, and the main reason I've found this game to be rated M is because of mods, which are essentially downloadable content for games. Some of these mods include content that would not be good for young boys. However, these mods all are either scams that will do nothing, or have been erased from the internet. Also, mods are hard to download. Like, really hard.
You can also get married in this game, but that's about it. If you explored every single library and town in this game, the worst you'll find is a piece of literature with swear words. Nothing bad.
In conclusion, this game is great for mature kids ages 12+
Thank you for taking the time to read this,
Christine."
s,"The Truth Ok lets cut the crap the other reviews are saying 1 the most sexual content is getting married there is no kissing or anything you only say ""are you interested in me?"" if she says yes thats it no kissing or sex.2 when you drink beer all you do is go in your inventory and click drink thats it you dont even see him drink it!3 The only bad thing is violence and there is no guts or gore just a little blood from slashing with a sword.4 you should let kids play it i am suprised how strict common sense media is ""not for kids"" why cause of blood?5 you actually teach your kids to save money! Overall i think its suitible for a 12 year old about half way to 13."
a,"Future Game of the Year One of the best games you can find around. Where you can cast exploding fireball spells, to creating your very one sword for profit. Now for the appropriateness. Now the game came out today (11/11/11) so don't expect 100% accuracy. ESRB was reasonable about the gore rating. People get sentance to death via beheading. On of the one handed perks even gives a %30 percent chance of decafatation. I haven't notice much sex talk, yet. And you can consume alcohol, such as wine. One thing is for certain, they made their own illegal drug called ""Skooma"" which CS somehow failed to mention in Skyrim and Oblivion. You can even find Skooma dealers on the roads and buy the stuff from them. Or you can walk away. I one time found a skooma dealer that talked about how good skooma was. I said ""This doesn't sound legal."" Then she tried to kill me so she fell victim to my mighty axe! It does have slow motion animation killings sometimes. For example one time when I was facing a wolf, I picked it up and slammed my axe on it. The dragons and giants can be brutal though. There is video of a dragon biting an archer, swinging him around, then chucked him across the field. The giants just stomp on you and slam their clubs. But they are pretty terrifying. Not ghost story terrifying, they can like kill you in one shot of their club so yea, they're pretty powerful. The funny part about them is that there is a very common glitch where when a giant kills you, you go flying a mile into the sky. You also get to choose whether you fight te defend the people, or be a serial killer. Though if you choose evil, you get a bounty on you meaning that the guards will want to see in prison. Also, if your bounty is high enough, they wont even give you the opportunity to surrender, they'll just attack you on sight. In other words, this game is amazing!
EDIT: If you choose evil, there are ways to avoid bounties. You only get a bounty if you are caught by someone else committing crimes. You can monitor wether or not you are being watched when in sneak mode because it has a little eye thing that tells you if you are hidden, at risk of detection, or detected. I even took advantage of that and robbed a meat stand in brood daylight when a guard was just a couple yards away and avoid a bounty by only robbing when I was hidden. I have found some sex talk. It was woman upset over her husband thinking he was sleeping with some other woman. There is racism. The Stormcloakcs, (rebels who want independence from the empire,) only want Nords in Skyrim, and the citizens in Windhelm hate anyone who is not a Nord, primarily Dark Elves and Argonians (lizard people.) There is torture. I got a quest to spy on the Thalmor, (A group of elves that for some reason hate the worship of a god known as Talos,) they were hitting a man with a mace to get information. Just be happy I busted that guy out. Their are guilds you can join. The Companions, legendary mercenaries, College of Winterhold, good guys that teach magic, but are disrespected, Thieves Guild, a group of thieves, and Dark Brotherhood, hired assassins. There is also a political conflict with wether or not Skyrim should go independent. Stormcloaks, rebels who want independence, they are angry at the empire for banning the worship of Talos, and believe that the Nordic way of life is in danger, but are racist and only want Nords in Skyrim. The Imperial Army wants Skyrim to still be part of the empire, they'll let anyone be in Skyrim and want to uphold the peoples safety, but conflicts with the Nordic way of life and were forced to ban the worship of Talos, thanks to the Thalmor. You get to choose witch side you want to take. There is even achievements for completing their quest lines. Hopefully this edit helps you to decide even more."
s,"Amazing: Blood can be a bit harsh, but can be fixed with texture mods that also improve graphics in the process. I feel that the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a must play game for all kids ages 10 or eleven and up. It is especially cool for players that are interested in medieval lore or dragons. I've been playing the game for two years now, and haven't come across any sexual encounters at all and the violence isn't that bad, but can be toned down if you're a parent and are worried about your child being influenced towards violent actions. Over all, there are no drugs except for potions such as potions of healing that have no side effects. Alcohol is used and can be bought from a general goods store or tavern, but has the proper negative side effects that will turn people away from making significantly bad life decisions. Great Game!"
s,"The Truth of this Game This game, definitely doesn't deserve a ""M"" rating, ""T"" would be much more suitable overall. The only sexual content is seeing people in their underwear, and the rare talk of sexuality. The violence is an issue for younger players, but isn't horrible. The language, is pretty much that of a ""T"" rated game, only hearing D*mn and B*tch here and there. But to wrap up, I've played countless hours on this game, and come to the conclusion.-This game really isn't that bad."
a,"Amazing game; Blood can be harsh, but there's so much to do! This game is amazing! There's always something else to do and discover. The main story is massive and when you finish that there's still so many side quests to do. I love this game, it's probably one of the top five games i've ever played. this game is not suitable for young children considering the amount of blood in this game. The game is great, the map is massive (and when i say massive i mean massive), and there's always more to do."
a,"Great Game A bloody and violent adventure! My 2 greatest concerns are the violence and mods. With the mods, some mods can alter the characters or add characters, and can make them wear bad clothing. An amazing game otherwise! Some mild language such as the D word may come up. Supervision is recommended."
s,"Best for teens and up This is my favorite game ever...I recamend it for anyone over 15.
one thing common sense media didn't say anything about in their review is that skyrim has the GD word in it...well, only briefly...you just find it in stormcloak camps...if you keep talking to them they will say the GD word."
a,"Surprising but not for the Reason you would Expect Well, I got suckered into buying the game because everyone was saying how awesome it was. They were completely right, though. It's huge and open. I love being able to choose what to specialize in and how to live in my not-so-little fantasy universe. Graphics and sound are beautiful. The only gripe I had was the somewhat primitive combat system. I just wish I could tell where damage is coming from, and hit detection can be a little odd at times.
Now, for the ESRB business, I initially didn't know why it was rated M. Though there was blood, it didn't strike me as overly gory. However, I soon learned that it was rated M for another reason. It's an incredibly personal game. Mature choices must be made, and being insightful goes a long way. Sometimes, you need to choose to kill a character with your own weapons etc. Also, it is a first-person game. You get right up to a person and hack and slash. While the blood is not the issue, the incredibly personal aspect of the game is. Definitely discuss it with a kid, as I'm 16 and was somewhat surprised by it. If you are a kid, think about the kind of person you are and how it will come out in a game like Skyrim. Surprisingly, I've learned quite a few things about myself by playing it and making choices I would never otherwise be able to make. I'm putting educational, but not because you'll learn about photsynthesis or anything. You may just learn life lessons from a game completely based in fantasy."
a,It Do Not Get Much Better Then This This game is amazing. Game of the year great. It's perfect for kids if there parents allow there kids to play Batman: Arkham City. The beginning decapitation is all you need to worry about because the game is full of choices. You do not need to kill. Yes the ESRB is correct. Blood and gore. Stay in the citys like river wood. There is basically no sex relation. You can get married by sharing rings. No kissing. It's always nice to have a mature teen. Paying 60 bucks for one city is not letting it live up to its full potential. Best game ever. Hope this review helped.
s,not as violent as most people think csm will you plz stop spoiling parents ideas of games?i know how violent elder scrolls is becoz i play it practically a few times a week so i know it isnt as violent as you think it is there are much worse games out there which you rated lower
s,"The TRUTH There havent been many good reviews on this but im going to tell the truth.
The game itself...
Educational value - 3/5! Like most RPG games this inspires children to save their money, learn how to sell in the market and auction.You choose how you play. You must decide what the best path to take is and there is a lot of research to be done on your class your race and your talent tree. Much like well known RPG based games like 'World of Warcaft'.
Positive messages - 2/5! None apart from what I have just said!
Postive role models - 1/5! This game doesnt have many but it has a few noble knights who would offer their life to defend their town. Apart from that there aren't many.
Ease of play - 3/5! The controls are straight forward but if you want to seriously get into the game you will need to do some research online.
Now time for the decider if you want your child to play this...
Violence - When you hit enemies sometimes blood spurts out. There is no torture at all. People talk of executions, there is 1 but all you see is a person being captured and told he will be executed. He does not beg, scream, shout or cry when he hears this. Nothing much with the violence.
Sex/Sexual references - Nothing much. There are festivals and feasts where half naked women dance but kids below the age of 9 see this on TV.
Language - None.
Drinking, drugs, smoking - There are Skyrim drugs called Skooma which you see around the place. There is drinking but kids will see this all the time.
Over all - If you have a child who is mature and over the age of 10 then this is fine!
It is a brilliant game too."
s,"Skyrim This may sound like a 1st graders persuasive essay for school but Skyrim is a good game and somewhat educational, there’s almost no swearing(usually silly stuff like n’wah which means foreigner in some fictional language in the game and s’wit which means stupid in a fictional language in Skyrim) there is no sexual content besides for stories which have no pictures! Although there are some dark themes, like joining these guilds which assassinate people good or bad and you can help these evil gods but in your own glory, or become a vampire and drain innocent peoples blood(which is horrible but it’s not gory or violent/has no blood) but it’s optional (usually) but if you don’t want to let risks run by just download a modification to just delete these things from the game. Mods, about mods/modifications they are things you can download for your game but some of these modifications add sex and more gore(such as organs flying out) the original game does not contain this content. I would recommend your kids playing Skyrim on ps4 or Xbox 1 because these sex mods and stuff are not allowed on the Xbox version and ps4 version because Bethesda studios/the creators of Skyrim own the game and the mods on computer are downloaded via third party websites which can’t be trusted sometimes and can give viruses while on Xbox/ps4 I don’t think third party websites are allowed and so the mods added onto the Bethesda website have to follow the Bethesda mod TOS(unless it’s a third party website) such as no sexual content and you can’t add mods that can kill children(children are protected in Skyrim) and lastly the drugs part, yes there is a lot of (fictional) drugs like on called skooma and moon sugar your character can use the drugs but can’t get addicted too them, there is also ale and alcohol and which is harmless and for the great messages and role models part, the only one really is your character because you can play as a man who does good, man who does evil or one the does both(which ruins the role playing aspect) so altogether Skyrim is good for mature 12 year olds and 13+"
s,"They WAY over exaggerated it First off, there’s no language except “damn”
And I think one “hell” but certainly nothing to be concerned about. Secondly, the violence doesn’t go beyond a tiny bit of blood whenever you hit someone and your mostly fighting monsters and criminals. As far as gore is concerned the only things worthy noting is that sometimes there’s some blood on the wall and you can get a one or two handed perk that allows you to chop peoples heads off. The closest thing to gore is you can find bloody skeletons lying around sometimes but nothing beyond that (no intestines, guts or innards). Alright, I’ve played this game for years and there is only ONE quest (not necessary for completion) that even ADDRESSES sex in any way, and all you have to do is talk to some people that were involved, nothing else happens. In conclusion this game is fine for your kid to play by all means, CSM Waaay over-exaggerated the content in this game."
s,"Good for 13 and up U think that the blood makes it seem like it should be 17 and up, but their isn't much blood in it."
s,"Why this game is rated an 18 So a kid maybe 13 or something might ask for this for their birthday or whatever and depending on the parent they may go: ""OH MY WORD! IT'S AN 18!!! THERE'S BLOOD?! YOU CAN BECOME A VAMPIRE!?!? AHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHHAHA""
or: 'yeah whatever my wallets in my hoodie'
or: 'I'll look into it ok?'
The third reaction is probably the most sutible, but may still lead to parents freaking out about the fact its rated an 18. The reason It's rated an 18 is because there are so many possibilities. You could be a noble nord, loyal to your country and protecting the innocent if that was the only path you could take this game would probably be rated a 12, but extremely boring. But on the other hand, you could be skyrims most wanted criminal, who's a vampire AND a cannibal plus is a thief and assassin. If that was the only path you could take this would stay an 18 and be maybe more fun for a bit, but get boring after a while. It really depends on what character YOU create. blood and undead stuff isn't really avoidable but people need to stop over reacting so much, like others have said a lot of kids and teens play games with the same amount or more blood than this one, and often games like that (not all but some) don't really give you the option of right or wrong and don't require you to consider the aftermath of a situation. This game WANTS you to think about that stuff! It doesn't encourage the player to kill everyone they see and it doesn't glorify war and battle, some characters do others really don't! In skyrim there is a war currently going on between imperials and stormcloaks, and it's very complicated and quite realistic, it's not a simple situation of good vs evil it's so much more and because im a nerd i love looking into skyrims lore and all the little hidden details about this war and so many other things as well like skyrims gods (skyrim has it's own unique gods called the 8 or 9 divines depending on which side of the war you are on). You can steal things, commit murder and other stuff but it's against skyrims law and therefore you have to deal with the consequences if your caught. There is this stuff called 'skooma' in the game which is meant to replicate drugs HOWEVER, it's not a large or very noticeable part of the game and it's really expensive like why would you want to spend your gold on that? Anyway that leads me onto skyrims economy system. Sometimes if you help an NPC with something they will reward you with some gold coins or you can steal gold or find it in dungeons and stuff. Different merchants will buy and sell different things and at different prices. There's way more to this game than I've said and this isn't a very organised review sorry I kinda just spurted out loads of stuff that's great about this game. I don't think this game is scary at all really and I don't mind the blood because you stop noticing it after a while."
s,"Will go down as a Classic Masterpiece Story: 4/5
Gameplay: 5/5
Plot: 5/5
Message: 4/5
Addictive: 5/5
Overall: 23/25
I've been playing Skyrim for a long time and have very much enjoyed it. The game never gets boring and is always fun to go into the world of Skyrim and slay dragons, discover new dungeons, and earn new gear, ext.
Skyrim has always been one of my family's favorite games and one that my brother, my dad, and my uncle all share an interest. its always a blast to discover new things and complete a quest and be awarded. The game also allows you to customize your character and decide on your actions. you can play as a Warrior, Mage, or a thief/ assassin. In appropriate wise a child 9 or older i feel can handle it. There is no sex or language and only some blood and little gore.
Violence: 4/5
Sex: 1/5
Language: 1/5
Overall: 6/15"
s,"It ok sheesh why so uptight Well I started at like seven or eight but what I’m saying is I barely remember any cursing maybe some here and there but it’s really fine if your ok with a little blood also don’t make the same mistake I did when the blades ask you to kill paarthinax don’t he is wise and old and perfect “what is better to be born good, or overcome evil nature with great effort?” -our dear friend paarthinax"
s,"Not that bad. Skyrim is an 18+ game, for some reason. In reality, there is no sex / nudity, and the violence isn't bad compared to games like DOOM Eternal.
The violence isn't shoved in your face and can be ignored, it's typical violence in an rpg that isn't exaggerated at all. If you kid is mature enough or is a teenager they should be fine. The story is about you being the Dragonborn, who is a human with the soul of a dragon. Swearing is also minimal."
s,Great game its good
s,"AMAZING!!!!!!!!! This game is the best!!! your can do anything you want within reason.
Good stuff:
The fighting gameplay is so fun, great storyline, Crafting system is realy cool, plus there is something called ""skyrim play together"" were you can well... play together!
Bad stuff (not a lot of it):
some swearing, only one curse word said in the ENTIRE game, tiny bit of sexual content, skyrim play together is little glitchy in the normal version."
s,"The Wii Game I Coveted Most... This game rocks! Graphics are excellent! The only real thing parents may be concerned about is Rouge the Bat. She doesn't flirt on this game, but her outfit reveals her breasts a tad. Otherwise... go and compete with a mustached plumber and a blue hedgehog!
***NOTE ABOUT ANOTHER CSM MEMBER'S REVIEW*** Steroids have been used in the REAL Olympics by dishonest athletes. There are NO steroids OR drugs used in this game; Mario, Sonic and the crew are boosted in races by a power boost built up as they run. Also, while Peach, Amy, Blaze, and Daisy DO wear short shorts, it's not really immodest enough to call ""underwear."" (Go to any ''Victoria's Secret'' and see what I mean! 0_0) There are indeed weapons in this game, but nobody gets truly hurt, and you can always remind your kids ""Don't play like that!"" I'm sure the reviewer meant well, but please be assured that this game is drug-free, sex-free, and kid-friendly! :)"
s,MARIO AND SONIC RULES! I love to see Kirby games. Boys like Sonic and Girls like Kirby. Mario and Sonic are true friends.
s,"The best mario and sonic ! This game teaches you teamwork, and also learns you stuff about the olympics . In teamwork games you can play with real people . E.g in some dream events (unreal sports) you have to help each other , or in the estafettes this game is also easy to play with."
s,"Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic games I think Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic games is a good wii game, although under 6's might find this hard to play, also the games are very complicated."
s,"Extremly Boring! Review by rsm2. This game is one of the most boring ones I've ever played. Do not be fooled, if you like the winter games version [which I did] you might still hate this one. Gameplay is slow in many of the events [EVEN SWORDPLAY!!!!] are slow though a couple of events are fun. London Party is stupid and nothing compared to festival mode at the winter games. This game is annoyingly slow at should not make its way on to your holiday list."
s,LONDON 2012 This game is a very good game to teach and a very good influence for children to be athletic and active.
s,Learning olympics. But this one is fun type. A good game for the Wii. The 3DS version isnt as fun. Dont buy it for 3DS. Less olympics. The wii one shows great transaction and more stuff. THe 3DS may get you dissapointed.
s,"very fun, great graphics,mario and sonic reunite, GREAT, but some bits left out very fun and made for family fun but you will get if you have less then 2 remotes"
s,great 
s,"Solid Mario Game Great game, my sister and I love to play. Really no issues at all, it's just fun to try the various sports."
s,"Good The game features the titular character Rayman, and his friend Globox, with the help of Teensies on their adventure through perhaps one of the most beautifully and creatively designed worlds I've seen in any game. The voilence is very slapstick, no blood or gore, when enemies and characters are defeated they simply puff up like a balloon and float off popping into thin air. The game starts out relatively easy, but gets pretty tough later on. The controls are very tight and the characters respond to everything you do precisely. Up to 4 people can play in co-op, similar to New Super Mario Bros. Wii. The nymphs dress pretty revealingly, in short skirts and tube tops, but nothing is shown. The sound track is very good too, and the songs are pretty silly at times."
s,"Awesome!! This game is ridiculously cute. I adore the art style - visually, the game is stunning - and the soundtrack is the cutest thing ever. I played the original Rayman as a kid, and this really does it justice. It's way more forgiving than the first one too - each level is divided into small chunks, so if you die, you're never set back too far. The co-op play is great for friends or siblings. Just play it. Ugh, so good!"
s,"AGE RESTRICTIONS! Language - Extremely very mild references. Hardly noticeable!!
Sex - Mild female clevage nudity!
Violence - Mild! Not bloody or graphic.
Other - Nothing much.
Hope this helps!"
s,"ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER!!! This is like one of the best games ever! It is so addicting! The characters, monsters, levels, different worlds, and slapstick violence all combine to make this game worth playing! I love this game! Totally worth buying! I can't wait for the sequel(Yes, A SEQUEL)! It's gonna be called ""Rayman Legends"". It lookes as awesome as Origins!"
s,"Another really good rayman game! Very good, epic levels and bosses with really cool levels! You can also play with friends and family with multiplayer mode! Great for Kids!"
a,"kind of inappropriate there are almost naked fairies and princesses.
Rayman stands behind an exposing cardboard cutout
a teensie rubs on a cannon full of lums and jumps up and down on it (h*mping-like)"
s,"Good game (I have 3ds version and this) This game I got for The Wii And The 3ds. The game is pretty good, And on the 3ds Version i have 1 New file that i did for fun, and A one i started on since i got the game For easter 2013, I like the game, and it's pretty good. Also, I'm a pretty ""Classic"" Gamer. I know all sorts of Geeky stuff, Like the Old consoles, Like the NES."
s,toally clean...... This game has absoutely nothing wrong in it. All the violece is sapstick.
a,"Fun, But Can be Inappropriate Rayman Origins is by far the best and most exciting platformer I have ever played. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an exciting, fast-paced adventure! However, the game has some strange and inappropriate images, especially the ways the fairies are dressed, showing large amounts of cleavage and overly-sized breasts. If your child is mature, the most definitely get this game. 11+ should be fine."
s,"silvonadux review This is an awesome game when it comes to the graphics and other visual effects, game-play and controls, and creativity with the powers Rayman has and the courses he races through. But the music is. . . uh . . . I can't find a word for it but it's the same little tune over and over and over again. this isn't like Sonic the Hedgehog music, I'm talking about little music clips and jingles every two seconds! IT IS ANNOYING. Believe me, I know. I would listen to my ipod while playing. Other than that, it is fun and enjoyable. There could possibly be creatures/characters that could appear scary to younger players younger than nine."
s,fun game i think this is epic for all ages but only one thing the fairys in bikinis thats it though
s,"Very Fun Game! Rayman Origins is a very, very, fun cartoon platformer game. Their is some slapstick/cartoonis violence, like slapping and punching other characters or monsters, but its pretty mild. Also, some fairies you save throughout the game wear suggestive outfits, but it's nothing too serious. Overall, Rayman Origins is a very enjoyable game that's suitable for kids around 9 or 10 years old. I suggest picking this game up at Gamestop the next time you go there, you wont regret it."
s,"Great game, but it still needs something. This game gives a take of the cartoonish version of the original rayman games (hoodlum havoc, the great escape) bringing out a whole new idea of gameplay. I must say ( as a big fan of the original rayman games) i do prefer the originals. Sure this new game is family friendly and is wacky so that young gamers can enjoy it, but it just feels a bit unusual to call it a rayman game. Yes its the same character, but it does not have the characteristics of rayman. You could say im over-reacting, but i just think it's not the best rayman game out there. That said it still is fun and enjoyable, i jut think if they release an other in the cartoon rayman series that they should think more about what they include. I would rate this game an 4/5."
s,Good! is really good this game and family-friendly. my lil´bro plays it
s,good good game and awesome i even have it
s,"A very fun game! This game is very fun and easy to manipulate! There is no sex, nudity, language, drugs, or intense gore. The violence in this game consists of the enemy simply dissapering. But, like almost every single video game or app, this one can be addicting depending on the kid's maturity or age. It would give this a lower age rating, but later in the game, it does get pretty complex and requires a higher level of thinking, so it may not be fun for lower ages."
s,it is the best! I love it because it is so fun!
s,"A Note To Parents If you've ever been on commonsensemedia before, you know how they grade their reviews. So, I'll tell you this: With video games, they are incredibly biased. For a video game review, take the age they give you, and subtract about 5 or 6 years, and THAT'S the suitable age. So, for this, it's really OK for about 13 plus. I put 12, though, because, a twelve year old would have no problem playing this. It's literally like a cartoon. I've seen more graphic violence in Spongebob, and that's not a joke. Two of the very most graphically violent movies I've ever seen in my life (Saving Private Ryan and Evil Dead(2013)) both got OK for 16+ and iffy for 17+, respectively. Well, my kid saw me watching SVP, and he had nightmares about for a week. I let him play this, and it didn't phase him in the slightest."
s,"ESRB IS CRAZY! This game is about exploration and fantasy. It has elves, gnomes, troll, ogres etc. This game is similar to the amazing game s k y r i m only it is cartoony so everything doesn't look that real. The best Dad is right though, The ESRB really screwed it up this time. Also like the best Dad said, there is nothing wrong with this game. This honestly should be rated T. I hope I was helpful and that you consider allowing this wonderful game into your home. Peace."
s,"Another mistake the ESRB made Hello!
I am a father of two. I have a 13 year old and 15 year old. When I was at the store my child came to me and asked for this game. As usual I looked at the back to see what the ESRB rated it M for. Then I looked the game up on YouTube,(Because they usually over exaggerate) and found that the ESRB was exaggerating on EVERYTHING. I saw no blood. None. For the violence, it is equivalent to M i n e c r a f t. I allowed this game because I knew my 13 year old could handle it, I even think a 10 year old could handle this game but he/she should be mature. This is coming from a deeply religious father who frowns upon violence. All in all, 13 is an absolute okay for this game, I have no idea what the ESRB was thinking."
s,"Hugely entertaining awesomeness Most people, kids and adults alike, are likely to ignore this fantastic game, due to a certain game (skyrim), but they would be missing out on a near-perfect game. There is very little bad language in this game, never going further than bas**rd, which is fine for an 11 year-old. There is a lot of violence, but hardly any detail whatsoever, although the skippable cutscene at the start has a severed head shown in it, but again, hardly any detail. You would be missing out on an incredible game if you don't go out and buy this right now."
a,Great game This game isn't bad at all the rating is a lie. It is somewhat violent but there's no sexual content whatsoever. My 5 year old nephew watches me play this but I'm still going to rate it 10+ because there are options where you can steal and kill innocent people and people might not want their kids seeing that.
a,"KIndoms of amalur AWESOMENESS Im only nine ive but played the game. It does have a lot of blood. Its a lot like skyrim, because you can loot chests and get arrested and its kind of a sandbox game. It is awesome, and the armor is awesome, great graphics and everything. Its fine for kids, u can kill people and goblins and trolls, but its still awesome. let ur kids try it. Its about the character you play ""the fateless one"" and you get revived from the dead by the well of souls, and you get to create your own character at the beginning, and there is a dude with a moustache:) and you try to discover the truth about your death, and you can use bow and arrows, swords, staffs, magic, daggers, and spears and a bunch of weapons. You can do a special move called ""Reckoning mode'' where you become super powerful and you grab your enemies and stick a knife through there face or some kind of fatal death, and you can do sneak attacks and everything. I LOVE THIS GAME. Just have your kids ignore the blood. No badwords in the game (: But be warned, really bloody and you can pickpocket people. You can break out of jail, but its all fake(: would be rated T if you couldnt go into reckoning mode.if you kill somebody, blood will spray all over the walls and ground. BEST GAME EVER((::"
a,"Amazing game! Awesome game. Yes there is a considerable amount of blood but if you let your kids play halo or COD, your kid should be just fine. Rich graphics, storyline, and character customization, this is not a game fantasy lovers should Passover. The best part has to be the customization of your character. It's easy to play, and hard to master. Teens will enjoy this one."
a,"extremely bloody, yet good in all else This game has a lot of bloodshed and brutal moves, but no gore. It has captivating gameplay and a nice lasting appeal. Although one could beat the main quest in a day, all the side quests and faction make it last a long time. It also cqan be described as a step down from skyrim. The only minor cursing is the occasional d--n and bas---d. The women do dress somewhat scantily sometimes."
s,"its fantastic! they really should fix it. it IS for kids. the game has easy violence and not bloody, in fact i havent seen any bad words in it. though the only violence is the look of the monsters, kinda creepy, not for under 10. other than that the game is fantastic and entertaining, i recommend parents to let their kids try this game, i assure you. they will love it! however its not for learning at all."
a,"Really good game! This game is absolutely AMAZING! My parents were glad that it had not sexual content and no bad language. But if u or ur parent are concerned about violence i dont think is the game for u. There is a lot of blood, you can do some pretty gruesome moves with ur weapons and there are images of dead or mauled bodies (but nothing too graphic, it looks really cartoony and there is no scary images either). So yes violence is one of the cons of this game. But if u or ur child have played previous games with blood and weapons/shooting then i think ur okay. This game is very fun and very exciting i love how u can chose to be anyone u want to be and its a long game that u wont get bored of. So parents (or kids) who want this game: Buy it! I think it is an amazing game and it has no sexual content or bad language in it. The Violence is like any other shooting/weapon game ur child has probably already played. so really good game and i recommend it!"
a,"A little bloody, but AWESOME!! Kingdoms of amalur reckoning, is one of the best RPGs you will ever play. And if it weren't for the blood, it could probably be rated T. In the beginning, you're brought back to life by something called the well of souls, and you now have the power to change you're fate, and even the fate of others. The blood is the only issue, for example, when you enter ""reckoning mode"" you can do slow-mo special attacks that can result in stabbing right through your enemy, cutting their heads off (I haven't witnessed this yet so it is most likely rare to happen) or going on a non-stop rampage. Even though i made that sound bad, its not really, and it only lasts for a few seconds. Overall, if you like RPGs, and are over at least 12, than you'll love this game, I sure do!"
a,"perfect for older teens This is an awesome game but it is bloody...there is one decapitation in the opening cutscene but thats it....there are some suggjestive women in the game...and theres a snake like creature with bare breasts but thats it, its a very clean game"
a,"A good RPG,just down with the violence. I have this for my Xbox and PS3 and play this everyday.It is a very fun RPG which stands out amongs most and has endless potential.However,the problem is the non stop extreme violence.Down with that,and the perfect game.If your kids really want this,consider turning off the gore and blood in the options.Overall,a must buy game,one of the best of this year,at least until Mass Effect 3 comes out,which I have been anticipating for."
a,"Amazing!!! (TAKE CAUTION OF THE VIOLENCE) I have never actually played the game, but i have seen over an hour of gameplay. It is violent and very bloody. There are many different moves where you stick something (like a sword) through the enemy and blood gushes out of the enemy. Other than that there is nothing wrong with it. It is not a bad game. Definately not like those m rated shooters... no, this is a fantasy rpg (role playing game)"
a,"It is pretty cool Seriously enough with the not for kids stuff. I have never really played the game because all I have is a Wii, I hate bloody gross games but this is not as bad as other M games. It could easily be rated T. It does have a lot of blood though but nothing like those shooter games it's more under the Final Fantasy rating. I have also saw a ton of gameplay of this game and there is hardly any language and there is mild blood, but it has one scene where he stabs a guy to death that was really gross but that is the only part other than that it is a pretty awesome game"
s,it is very fun but it is also very easy its graphics are very good
a,"Great!! It's a great game! It has little blood. The only bad stuff is they might show you or your opponents eyes swollen or you might have a bloody nose or maybe a few cuts, nothing a 10 year old couldn't handle. The sex rating is just a cheerleader in a bikini showing what round it is. It is mildly easily. There is no swearing at all. It is only violent."
a,Very Violent It's a good game but it has a lot of violence and blood
s,"A few things to consider. This game is not really that violent, practically speaking. The game is more of a simulation. You can plaster your body with whatever kind of tattoo logo you want. The only really other thing is that the ads for energy drinks that occur frequently."
a,"UFC Undisputed 3 This game is a fun one but there are some things you should look out for. There are ads and sponsorships along with the fighters using some bad words. Also ring girls wearing little clothing walk around the ring in between rounds. Another thing is there is violence with the fighters kneeing, punching, and kicking each other. Overall it is a fun game but may not be appropriate for younger kids."
s,"SSX throws tedious tasks into the fun factor it's famous for. SSX is hands down the best snowboarding game out there. Other games pale to it and have failed in fun, presentation, execution, and usually are graphically boring in comparison. Having said all this SSX is HD for the first time and just as impressive as ever. You pull insane tricks, grind, fly high, gain boosts and navigate the mountain in several insane and fun ways including the 'squirrel' suit.......however..... the fun is now overshadowed by tasks that are often frustrating and kill the fluid gameplay that it's been known for. For instance, there is now a rewind button but it's not really for convenience, it's because you will be falling off the track so much that you will have to use it over and over just to survive on many of the missions you're given. If that sounds fun you may like the elusive 'don't run out of oxygen coming down the mountain' as you do as little as possible to just get down the hill without passing out and sometimes when it's pitch black. These additions for realisms sake cause me to recommend almost ANY other older rendition of the game. Realism is OK in some instances but it shouldn't force fun games like this into not being the over the top get together game it used to be. Oh, and now it's only 1 player local too. I can't recommend this to anyone who's played the old one unless you would enjoy the new 'realistic tasking' and online only multiplayer. Best one in my opinion was the Gamecube versions SSX On Tour where you get to be Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach or you can try SSX3 both of which are split secreen and forego the mission orientated story. They are not as graphically impressive but overall much more fun."
s,"One word: AWESOME!!! I love, love, LOVE this game! I'm not normally a sports game guy, but man, this is extremely amazing! Snowboarding through rough mountain ranges, performing sick air tricks, and even flying through mid-air with a wing suit makes this game incredibly enjoyable! This is that kind of game that will give you an adrenaline rush feeling that makes you want to do more tricks! This game is a winner, without question!"
s,"Good game, Great graphics... Oh no another snowboard game. Thats what i said when i first saw this game. I was never the best at those kind of games, but still i picked it up for a good price and tried it. Well lets just say i played it for a while afterwards. The game has amazing affects in it with a contrast of realistic to non realistic gameplay. It's easy to learn to play as well with there not being so many controls. Overall a 4/5 game which i would happily reccomend"
s,"Lovely and addictive action sports game! SSX (2012) is a reboot to a beloved and stylish franchise. It's over-the-top, arcade, snowboarding action at its best.
Violence is mild. Characters can fall off their boards &amp; crash into snowy mountains. One character can freeze to death (not depicted). Certain set-pieces take place in environmentally hazardous areas (intense avalanches &amp; harsh snowstorms) a few times."
s,"Great game all-round I got this game free as i would never usually get sports games but i was completely blown away by the graphics and game quality. The air tricks are awesome and the variety of races, surviving runs and doing the coolest tricks makes it really interesting. It also has some good motivational messages and role-models."
s,"Intense, and satisfying. Amazing. SSX is a BLAST. Let me get the parent stuff out of the way.
Violence: Players crash in painful ways, but usually just get back up and ride. Mild blood, if you crash ""red stuff"" will appear on the edges of the screen. Players can die in many ways that might make you cringe (from the sound effects that occur when crashing"".
Sex: On Alex's ""Tricky Move"" she pole dances on her snowboard. In a cut-scene Mac is shown with many women in a hot tub. In a helicopter, a poster with a silhouette of a naked woman is visible.
Consumerism: Real popular songs, as well as a Travis Rice character. Also, one of the helicopters has the ""RED BULL"" logo all over it.
Drugs: In a helicopter there is ""no smoking"" sign.
Language: Uses of the word ""punk""
Positive: The message is to not give up, and shoot big. All the characters love their job.
SSX is fun, great. My only problem is that it is difficult, and there is no splitscreen, however this does not tarnish the experience. It is epic, intense, And FAST. Great soundtrack, online multiplayer, gameplay, and tracks.If you love SSX or snowboarding, this is a must buy."
s,"A Footie Lovers Dream ... I can remember playing this game when I was a kid .. And honestly if you have a child in your family who loves football then this could be a good buy for them. The video game includes many football match modes like; last man standing - in which players need to preform goals to escape an Astro terf cage to win the match. An other game mode includes also the pauna rules mode in which players tally points for performing skill moves to confuse the opposition. Overall, this game is great and a real treat to play. An only down fall about this game is that it is has been made for only Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and is not compatible with an updated version of these consoles like the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4."
s,"A good game Fifa street is the most adapted football game ever. The skills compared to Fifa 13 are immensely different. The controls are hard to memorize, especially the skills, but who cares, just randomly pushing the joystick round is fun. There is no violence or bad language, and for online play you must be 13, so anyone can have it."
s,awesomeness i think it is awesome
a,"okay game, for 9- 11 this game can be pretty bloody and gory, but the age rating goes down to 10 or 11 after you turn of the blood, which you can do in the settings. if it is still is to violent, consider getting your child fate, which is nowhere near as violent as any other rpg's like torchlight 2."
a,"Great fantasy RPG, but not for under 13 Alright, this should be easy. Torchlight II is a fantasy RPG that involves defeating monsters to complete quests. However, right from the start, there is violence only to achieve a small thing. If you like those two things, you can ignore the rest of this. If you're a concerned parent, please keep reading. Due to the heavy violence, some parents might not want their kids (or themselves) to play it, and blood and gore are a crucial part of that experience. The developers have responded to the many (angry) reviews about the violence, so there is an option to disable blood and gore in the Options menu. This greatly improved the amount of younger players on Torchlight II, and many parents are happy with that. In summary, if you like achievement adventure, Torchlight II is for you."
s,torchlight 2-the paragraph This game can be challenging and frustrating but it can also be fun and satisfying. Not to mention the variety of classes and pets. And also it is 3-d.
s,Very fun. This is a very fun game the only bad thing about it is the fact that when you get very close to an enemy and critical hit them they explode into blood and guts.
a,a great game torchlight 2 is a great adventure game! lots of content! if your not the type for the blood and guts there is an option in the settings to turn it off. i did find that it does NOT turn off purple goo or squished green spiders.
a,"My two cents on Torchlight II. Torchlight II is an incredibly fun and easy-to-play dungeon-crawler type game that I recommend for ages 9 and up. Although it has blood and gore by default, in the options screen, you can easily turn it off.
There is no sexual content, no swearing, no drinking, and it's quite easy to play and fun. It has some pretty cool and lovable characters, and I really recommend it for anyone who loves adventuring!"
a,went overboard on the blood and gore the only reason that i think its for older kids is the blood and gore other than that its a great you can explore and fight off monsters and get cool weapons!!! you can turn off the blood and gore in settings then it would make it a 10 and under so worth the 20$ awesome!!!
a,"Great game, a little to bloody A amazing game overall, diffenitly worth the $20. the blood is incredibly frequant and you fight humenoid (and occasionally human) enemys. though the blood can be turned off. you can play on public games, so you never know what you will come across in those."
s,"Eerie and imaginative puzzle game that asks ethical questions. This is a wonderful game that requires reasoning to make progress. An excellent intro and simple controls help with the slightly complex gameplay. It feels like a blend of sudoku with hard sci-fi. The age rating is going to depend a ton on your kid's personality. If they like mysterious things it seems like a great redirect from other games or stories that may also have undesirable traits. I haven't finished this fairly long game yet, but I think I'm far enough in to have a sense of it's character.
It also asks some serious questions about what makes us human and what alien life could be like. Overall, this games makes you think."
s,"An Indie Sci-fi Puzzle Game Though it can be pretty spooky at times, the game isn't graphic or mature. The game focuses on puzzling through levels and progression.
Violence is mild. Your character can fall from heights and die, as well as get electrocuted, but no blood or gore is present. Not very graphic."
s,Not as good as the first This game wasnt as good as the first one but has new cars better graphics and new races. Sad to see no real competitors/characters like the last one.
s,Amazing but... its an amazing game and I am 11 and this game is amazing but sometimes some adults post inapropriate stickers which is bad but its an awesome game and I am playing xbox series s!
s,"A great racing game for free roam lovers, car lovers, and just eager gamers. This game is a must buy for a kid who wants a new racing game. When your kid says ""Oh mom or dad I want to buy Grand Theft Auto V because of the great view and the cool cars"" buy them this instead. The variety of cars is so amazing that you might like them more than a real car. The graphics are so beautiful that I think the water in this game looks more like water than real life! This game is amazing for kids 6 and up. If they are 6 though I recommend you help them play. On a final note, no violence,no death,no drinking or drugs, no foul language, and will get your kid too stop begging for GTAV. Just remember there is optional online chat."
s,"Epic Game! It's an amazing game. And the multi-player is fantastic. I don't see where violence is in the game, unless you call crashing into cars violent.."
s,"good, but only for certain ages. At the time I'm writing this, Forza Horizon 2 is over 6 years old, but some people are still playing it. It is a fairly good arcade-style racing game that would please many players of all ages. However, some downsides can impede your playing experience. Privacy concerns when playing Online Freeroam or Online Roadtrip have come up over the years, and some parents have banned their kids from playing with the online features enabled for various reasons. But if you are of older age and playing, I believe that this game would be completely fine to play through, whether it be online or in person."
s,"Best open-world racer I've ever played This game is rated E10+ for Mild Lyrics, Mild Suggestive Themes, and Mild Violence.
I love this game! I remember I purchased for my Xbox One back a year after it released and I was hooked. I remember starting up my 1969 Camaro and just hearing the roar of the engine. People this game is a must-buy.
Mild Lyrics - Some songs may cuss, but only one song I can remember has objectionable lyrics (Hoochie Coochie, Band of Skulls, about a stripper).
Mild Suggestive Themes - Some female characters at the Horizon Festival dance to the music played over loudspeakers, and their clothing isn't very skimpy but still shows skin.
Mild Violence - Cars crash, need I say more?
Overall - This game provided me with many memories and is probably my favorite Forza game of all time."
a,"Lovely sequel with an even BIGGER roster of cars! I'm only rating this game 11+ for the partial nudity (clad outfits show a bit of cleavage). Forza Horizon 2 is an amazing sequel to an already beautiful street racer. Vehicular violence is present, BUT not encouraged. Cars are mildly damaged. Strong language isn't present."
s,"Very realistic racing simulator with no violence In this game there isn't violence also because NPC's are behind barriers, and you can't see your character or other persons ones just theyre cars."
s,"Great open world, racing game Forza horizon 3 is the perfect combination of open world and car racing. It is very unrestricted and players can do whatever they want when they want: from putting massive engines in small cars to driving off the top of a mountain. The graphics and setting are visually stunning and combine deserts, beaches, Forrests and hills to make a very convincing Australian environment. Easily the best part of this game is playing with friends. You can also buy hundreds of cars from the old to the new to the cool to the weird, there are also so much customisable options where cool decals and paints can be applied to cars, hell you can even put a 500 horse power v8 in an original Mini Cooper. This is why this game is so great-you can do whatever the hell you want, in fact there is so much to keep you entertained that I haven’t even mentioned half the things in this game! There are no issues with swearing, violence, gore, sex or drugs because there are absolutely NONE whatsoever. To be honest the only reason I haven’t said it is good for all ages because it is quite complicated since you have to bid with in-game money to buy some cars as well as tune and upgrade cars with things like engine size, wheel width, tire pressure etc, all of which younger kids might find a little confusing. But overall very apropriate and fun and in my mind the best current racing game in the world."
s,"good game! this is a good game but ladies on the sidelines are wearing bikinis and crop tops and all that stuff. the car crashes into walls, trees, or simply a passing mercedes. and thats all i think you need to know."
s,"Great game FH2 is an awesome game. It's got tons of cars and tons of places to take them. If this is your first choice for an open world racer, you will probably love it. However, if you have been playing new open world racers like FH3, Need for Speed Payback, Burnout Paradise Remastered etc, then you won't want to come on over and play FH2. The next forza horizon installment, FH3, has much better graphics, a huge map dwarfing FH2s map, has much more interaction, and has over 300 more cars (Including DLC). So while this is a great game, it's successor FH3 is much much better. I would say if you haven't played any new open worlds, start with this one. It will give you a good feel of what they are like. If you've played the new ones, stay away from this game unless you just want to see how far we have come. You're still gonna love this game if you go from FH2 to FH3 and back, but I fear if you go from FH3 to FH2 then you're going to realize how spoiled you've been and it will ruin the experience. As far as language and nudity goes, the expert review says it all. Some song lyrics on your radio use the word ""damn"" and that's about it (also, you can choose to turn off your radio if you want). There are some AIs on the side that are in bikinis, but it's not like you're at a strip club. These are low detail AIs and it's nothing serious. Now back to the songs, there is one song that contains lyrics such as ""Touching you feels so right, let me come inside"" ""Touching you feels so right, let me, let me satisfy"". Those are the only risqué lyrics I can recall. All in all, it's a great game. It's older now, so you should expect it to not be top notch."
s,"I love this game so much I'm am one of the people that likes to play first person shooters like halo, call of duty, battefiels etc. But when my friend nagged me to try this with him I thought why not. I fell in love with this game. It is so much fun. I have put over 100 hours into the game and havent heard one swear word or any bad language. Violence wise there is none. If the driver got injurered of showed wounds then it would be a different story but it shows no damage to the driver. Sex wise on the beach there are girls wearing bathing suits which is not that bad. If you let your kid go to the beach it won't be a problem. I love this game and so will your kid. Hope this helped."
s,"Educational content, outstanding game. This game has been my favorite game for years. It's realistic graphics allow players to enjoy it. Real passion in the game. It is also very educational. If you fail a bucket list,your ""coach"" says the following: ""Don't worry, this one's a hard challenge. You should give it another go!"". The game does contain some issues, though. One time after missing a checkpoint, I was spawned inside a crowd of people and had to restart. The game is really good, though. I finished 80% of the game. Sumo Digital, Turn 10 and Microsoft Studios really got going in here. I would recommend it to anyone.
------LANGUAGE WARNING---------
Some songs have the word ""damn"" in them, but the language is at least not as bad as in the original Forza Horizon. (also, very, very good.)"
s,"Amazing car game I'm not even interested in cars and racing but this game is amazing! I love Online, you can select what classes to play (D, C, B, A, S1, S2 but there is no X) and there are minigames too like Infected! I don't see how crashing is violent, it's a really good game and I reccomend it :) If you want to be a racer too there are good role models like your character, and there is a girl who upgrades your cars and fixes ""barn finds""!!! 10/10 amazing game :D Hard to play at first but easy to get the hang of
GOOD JOB TURN 10!"
s,"This game is so much fun and fine for kids This game is one of the best driving simulators I have played. The way you can customise and tune your car is so realistic, not to mention the cockpit view. Nothing bad in this game except maybe bad role models of hooning but nothing else. If you don't like the words of a song than you can turn the radio of, and the songs aren't bad anyway. The only danger is online multiplayer but you do need Xbox Live Gold."
s,Know how to drive?... Good!! As long as you know how to pick up a controller and could use it pretty well this game is great. the feel of driving around Italy is awesome!!
s,"Vey good Forza Horizon 2 is amazing; the freeroaming is great. However there are some trollers that don't ready up for an online road trip, which is frustrating. Even when you crash, no sign of harm is shown. No language is included, same with drugs, alcohol and sex, and the experience of handling your own credits, and spending them on cars wisely is good for learning."
s,good good
s,Best Forza This is by far my favorite Forza to date. Those who fear about street racing are over reactionists who go crazy over every little thing. Its a good game to have fun driving cars you will never get in real life.
s,"It's educational This game isn't as bad as they make it seem. There are a lot of educational components and most kids are able to understand the content in terms of the person who created this having a funny sense of humor. It's plants vs. zombies with one additional level of violence - the very cartoonish blood. At first I only let my older son play this but after sitting with him, I felt it was fine for my 9 year old. I talked with him about the game and the meaning and what being ""insane"" meant and he had really good answers. For less mature children or anyone easily spooked, perhaps wait until older. But I definitely don't think this is an 18+ game. It may be offensive to the religious, but other than that I wouldn't avoid it for the themes. The gameplay can be quite educational and themes can be good points of discussion. And you CAN find positive messages in this - i.e. don't trust voices, protect yourself, persevere, use your resources wisely etc."
s,This game isn't a religious commentary. The story is literally based of a bible story. Every parent who uses commonsense media should go somewhere else and make your own decisions if you trust your child enough.
a,"why is this 18+ idiots this game has gore, but its very cartoony and not realistic at all. The story is based on a bible story and the game is very religious. The reason this game is 18+ is because Isaac uses PILLS. which give him effects like luck down, speed up, range up, ect… But why is this 18+? at least make it 13+. Games like Omori are very dark but young people can still play them, like Omori is litterly 10+. You should really change the rating. This game is really fun and its like zelda dungeons but darker."
a,"FYI - Abuse and Suicidal themes I haven’t played the game, but my son did. He enjoyed it, but I think parents should know that the themes are super dark. The protagonist commits suicide by crawling into a box. If your kid has issues with depression I would avoid this."
a,"For teens 13 or 15 and over. So I only rate this 15 and older is because of the fact of the amount of blood and gore, but it is 2D pixelations so it doesn't look very realistic. The main reason I rate it 15 and over is the amount of crude humor, such as poop which blocks your path, enemies pee themselves and enemies barf out blood to do damage, also you half to fight two giant peices of poo as a boss. there is some drugs such as pills that can harm you or just heal. there is syringe in the game to as a power up. and there is Isaac's mom who tries to kill him. If your kid can handle stuff like this, than 13 and over is a good age, but if it is too extreme than 15 and over would be best."
s,"Its not that bad... It has pixelated/animated gore and doesn't seem to have as much violence as expected. It has tough gameplay and can be punishing if you make the wrong move... It doesn't even deserve an M rating unless there is some kind of pure nudity which is only shown 2 throughout the game (and is like a line drawn by pencil). He doesn't use guns, only rocks, animated bombs, and his tears. It should be rated T overall... It even has a local multiplayer mode, but isn't the most entertaining. Overall, the game is great and gives a good challenge!"
a,"Chill. Out. Sure, there's blood and gore. But 18+? Are you kidding me? The Binding of Isaac is an 8-bit dungeon crawler in which a boy's fear and anger are used as weapons against his own imaginary terrors. You'll face skeletons, demons, mutilated conjoined twins and everything in between--and your only weapon is your own tears. Enemies will burst into bloody bits when destroyed, but then again, everything looks really unrealistic and stylized. Other than that, the game's only questionable content is the usage of various pills you find around the dungeon that alter Isaac's stats and abilities (some power-ups are also depicted as syringes) as well as a very simplistic stick-figure representation of Isaac naked. If you can handle the blood, then you're fine. A great game for teens and up."
a,"Depends mostly... The game in itself is already really dark and touches in very mature themes like how fanaticism and overuse of religion can destroy a family, suicide, evil in general, depression and divorce. add in the (actually hardly disturbing/scary) imagery and id tell you that you shouldnt let your child get near it until hes atleast 16. maybe 15 if hes not so easily disturbed / likes to think, like always though you should check the game out for yourself, watch videos of people playing it and then make your own verdict as on what you should let your child play, anyways have fun."
a,"Not for the immature This game, while great at providing hours of fun, is not for your children. A lot of the details given by others are seemingly accurate, but I see bias taking precedence over logical analysis. Body horror, drugs, potty humor, and gore are all present in this game, and are not suitable for children under the age of 15. Things to note are references to illegal and unsafe abortion tactics, and the over arching theme of child abuse heavily present in both the narrative and its biblical inspiration."
a,"Hard, yet fun It's hard to describe this game. It can be extremely fun at times and give you a large sense of power when you become nearly invincible, but a lot of times you'll give up playing it for the day because you keep dying. Underneath the blood and symbolism, it has a strong role model in the form of Isaac, constantly abused by his mother and abandoned by his father, who must now stand up to his abusive mother to survive... by destroying her heart? It can be nonsensical at times but otherwise it's a pretty fun and decently violent game. Just watch out if your kids have anger issues. Seriously. Be careful."
s,"THE AGE REVIEW ABOVE IS WRONG Do not think that this game is age 18+. While there may be some blood, there is not actually that much violence. The main weapon is isaac's tears, which I personally do not think is as bad as the weapons from League of Legends, which is rated teen. There are also some good messages, such as that you should not let someone kill you. For these reasons, i think that kids 9+ should be able to play this game."
s,good game good game
s,It was very fun I think as long as the parents aren't to uptight and the kids are able to realize that it is just a game
a,"Just because it put's religion in a ""bad"" way doesn't mean it's bad! Best rouge-like game I've played. It's very dark. Including scenes with suicide, blasphemy and other themes. Then why am I giving this an age 11 rating? To put it simply, your child already knows about stuff like sex, drugs and violence if they're past grade 4 and attended a public school. This game actually carry's a REALLY strong message. It's basically Isaac coming to terms with him self that you can't be perfect and you sin. The whole game was based of the creators family turning from alcoholics to Christians. The rating for 18+ CSM gave the game was too harsh. Also, why did I give this a positive role model? Well in this game you can play as: Isaac, Samson, Eve and more biblical characters. This game is very enjoyable and I say you need to get it"
a,"a great game with a lot of catholic inspiration the binding of Isaac rebirth is a complete reference to the bible story commonly revered to as the binding of Isaac. it is about Abraham a descendant from Noah thinks he hears god tell him to sacrifice his son on a mountain but right before he kills his son,a angel tells him to stop and sacrifice a lamb instead.all the unlockable characters also have catholic religions and all of them represent a sin. isaac is a creative and lonely child with a wild imagination which may or may not explain some thing plot-wise.the game play has a lot in common with the old the legend of zelda games.the game includes zero dlc other then the soundtrack and has a lot of replay-ability as there are over 150 different items and different templates for the levels.although it is fun, it can be cancer to look at sometimes with blood and gore,mutant feces and half formed and mutated human like enemies.overal i give he binding of isaac a 8/10 for originality in almost every department(story,items etc)."
s,"Age recommendation (not restriction), it’s fine until you dive deeper into it As of a game to play in your free time, it works just fine as an endless rogue like action game, but some curious people may take a dive into the game’s story, that’s when stuff gets dark apart from dark humor and the overall style of the game which is clearly visible by just playing it, this isn’t an age restriction, it’s an age recommendation.
The story’s accent is tilted towards a broken Christian family of Isaac, his mother and his lost Father, Isaac is a child with a huge imagination, he often plays with imaginary characters (some he calls “bad guys” and etc.) and leaves cruel reality, has a lot of affiliation with his father.
While his mother is told to offer her son as a sacrifice to God to prove her faith in God, before that, she was told two more messages both telling the Mother to “hide and protect” Isaac from the cruel world, but then, as she whipped out her kitchen knife, she attempted murder on Isaac and this is where the story truly begins.
Overall, age recommendation is 16+, 11+ will suffice for playtrough in your free time (this information has been proven with experience from a 9, 11, 13, 14, 16 and a 19 year old)"
s,"Funnest game Ive played in a long time First, there's something I must say. The game itself is based off a biblical story. So if there are any parents out there that don't want their child ""turning to the dark side"" and whatnot, you have no reason to worry. Th game is extremely fun, and extremely easy to get the hang on. If you own the game, I'd suggest checking out platinumgod.co.uk . That page has every item in the game and what they do."
s,Shouldn't be rated M I played this game when I was 8 years old on NG (Newgrounds.com) and it wasn't that bad. Also its an amazing game by the way lol. If you're religous you'll hate it.
s,"be overpowered with rng and kill satan this game is about a kid named isaac having an identity crisis while trying to hide from his mother and defend himself from monsters that came from the firey pits of hell itself. anyways, pretty good game. 10/10"
a,"The Bindinginginignignignignignigngigngigngigngigngignigngigngigngigngigningigngigngigngigngigngigngiggigngigngigngigngigngigngigngigngigngigngigngigngigngigngigngigngigngigngigngigngigng of isaac good game, would recommend, other than the fact that the storyline revolves around a child who literally asphyxiates to death in his own toy chest."
s,Really great game. Great for 12 and up. Really easy to play but hard to master game that is ok for 12 and up.
s,isaac is ok i think its good role model for us kids because isaac keeps perservireing to keep going trough hell to end the journey
s,"A nice distraction for 10-15 minutes every day or so It's actually one of the perfect games for a 10-14 year old with all its gross-out humor and blood and biblical messages and blood, so if you want to buy someone a game to play if they have done particularly well in any matter of subjects, give them this. I got it for 5 bucks around the sales."
s,common sense media is at it again honestly as someone who has killed mega satan in it and has most of the items i can safely say that caommon sense media is EXTREMELY stupid for giving this 18 plus the story of the game is based off of a story from the bible and the game is a little bit dark and isaac can have a cartoon butt on him in one of the cut scenes there is some gore but it looks very fake and some items like the pencil show isaacs sprite with a pencil in his eye and now his tears are led if your vhild goes to public school or has watched a pg13 movie or has been on youtube (the normal version) at least once than they can definitely handle this this is one of my favorite games of all time so my opinion is probably trust worthy
s,"A good game,dark at times but still good Honestly,the game is very good in gameplay and lore and I think as long as you are not heavy in religion and don’t mind a little gore and also don’t mind your character becoming weirder as you progress(as of afterbirth+ you can find a mirror desk in caves or depths that you can revert your character to look normal) you can play it."
s,"A fantastic game! This game should be more recognized because it I learned some stuff about Christianity from this game, sadly it overshadowed by other games , not saying that they are bad or anything, but older kids (11 or 12 years old) can play this game and learn at least something about the biggest religion in the world(Christianity), not that I am christian, I am in fact a muslim and I still like the game! :D"
a,"A amazing yet extremely gory game about the religion and insanity First, let me say that this is one of my favorite games ever. It has no end to the fun you will have playing it and is a challenge no matter how much you beat it. The game includes themes like drug abuse, Sexual abuse, insanity, lots of gore, animated scenes of gory self harm, and even a scene where Issac hangs himself. The reviews were saying that this game is for children nine and up. This is far from the truth. As a 14-year-old boy I can say that even I think that this game is inappropriate. While some reviews say that violence is at a minimum this couldn’t be further from the truth. Whenever you kill an enemy blood splatters everywhere. (Although it is pixelated.) most of the items Isaac picks up are items that cause self harm. (This does make sense with his tears being his main attack.) do not give this to a child unless they are ready for religious themes, self harm themes, lots of violence, and even suicide themes. If you think your child is ready to play his game and he is under the age of 14 look up a play through or a review of this game. In conclusion this game is an amazing game that you should play if you’re ready for it but if you are not definitely wait a couple of years."
a,"Binding Of Isaac Binding of Isaac has a ton of blood and gore but all of it is pixel-ated and lacks sense of realism. The game also goes over dark and depressing themes like suicide, child abuse, murder, and mental scarring. There's also use of pills, which can give you boosts in stats or give the message bad trip in which you take damage. It also has religious themes in it, and even has you making deals with the devil to get perks and items. While these are all in the game, if you or your child are mature enough its okay to play."
s,"Its not as bad as it looks The blood in the game is very cartoonish and fake looking. I can see how this game would offend you based on religion however even with the twisted backstory, I don't believe this game deserves to be rated M"
a,"Unapologetically tragic, masterfully told The Binding Of Isaac: Rebirth is an excellent example of a rogue-like game. It's consistently fun to play and has a lot of replay value. The story is very dark yet it gets its point across excellently. The more you play, the more of the story you discover, whether it be through items you find ingame, or unlocking different endings. It uses music and metaphors very well in order to portray a certain feeling.
CONTENT ADVISORY
Violence
This game includes some violence but it's definitely nothing to get upset about, let alone give it 18+. When you kill monsters in game they normally splatter into a pool of blood, and it's nowhere near as bad as something like Rick and Morty. You can use the cheat code ""BL0000DY"" to add extra gore and it still isn't that bad. The story is quite violent. It deals with topics like child abuse, bullying, &amp; suicide, but yet again, it's mainly to get its message across to the player, which is talking about the effects of religion if you let it overtake your life.
Sex
There are a few mild innuendos here and there, such as a few items. Such as: ""Placenta"", ""Mom's Pad"", and also in some of Isaac's primitive drawings you can see a stick figure penis.
Themes
If you're religious then this game might not be for you. The game basically targets the Bible and how much value it has, and also the effects of religion on kids. If you don't feel strongly about religion then this shouldn't be a problem.
Overall - 5/5"
s,"Rated M for No Reason This game is rated M. Don't follow that. It has pixelated blood and mild religious themes at the beginning. If you're offended by the story, don't play it. Otherwise, go ahead!"
s,"Not as bad as I thought it would be I was skeptical about getting this because it was rated M (and after all, there had to be a reason why it was rated m) But my child convinced me to try it out, so I let him. Then I saw that this was not anymore violent than power rangers(This is just an expression). I think the people who made rated this game did a bad job because this should be rated T."
s,"2019 version is better than ever as a definitive library of Halo. More content and games like Halo Reach Remastered. With the latest addition of Halo :Reach, the franchise is really building the hype up for the upcoming Halo Infinite on Next Gen XBox for Winter Holiday 2020. With rebooted 4k graphics , improvements and new Forge features, Reach is a perfect way to relive some local multiplayer Halo and appreciate what the most acclaimed game from the franchise has to offer. Although Reach is a $10 standlone DLC to the Master Chief Collection, it is also available on the Xbox game pass, both MCC and the Reach DLC upon release.
Although MCC was riddled with glitches and matchmaking issues, it's current state has improved VASTLY and added new games like Halo 3, 4 and now an HD revamp of Reach. It's a great and thorough collection for an avid fan or even better for someone who's never played, especially with so many couch co op options to ease the transition and play together locally.
Although some of the game versions are not as HD as others, there are so many option with multiplayer wave attacks in Firefight, building custom maps in Forge, solo and co-op campaigns, and multiple player vs player team battle modes (some with a large selection of vehicles for all out wars) etc that it's a great value no matter how you purchase or play. These are the most definitive versions of each Halo and have been made up to snuff and better than ever. This collection also includes the remastered and upgraded version of Halo 2 as well as The anniversary reworked version of the original Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 3: ODST."
s,Best halo game(s) 
s,"One of the best on Xbox One! This amazing collection of amazing and beautiful games is not as bad for kids as you may think. Many parents might think that the Halo franchise is too violent for kids, however, when I watched my kids playing it I was surprised. I always thought that Halo was a gritty brutal shooter, but I found that I was wrong. The blood is actually different colors and really isn't that noticeable. There is a bit of swearing, so if you are sensitive to that kind of thing, you may want to be a bit careful. But apart from that Halo: The Master Chief Collection is an amazing game, that even I enjoy with my kids."
s,"Still amazing! I remember playing the original game when it came out. Even now it’s great, I replayed the whole thing and it was just as fun as the first time. Little bit of blood. Almost no language. Some violence but only against aliens. I don’t know what CSM is talking about, the Master Chief is a positive role model. Since when is saving the world not positive?"
s,Not as bad as the rating says This game has quite similar themes to the popular franchise Star Wars. Most of the games in the collection are M with only a few being MA with slightly more grit. Definitely better than most titles on Xbox like Skyrim or Call of Duty. Don’t let your kids miss out on this fabulous collection of games just because of what it proclaimed on the box!
s,Bias review The violence in this game is nothing compared to what the review is. All I see is that you shoot aliens and save the planet by doing so. Master chief sacrifices his life for the planet and everyone living in it.
s,Great games It’s just all the halo games should be 12+
s,"An amazing collection... I was compelled to write a review for The Master Chief Collection especially after seeing Common Sense rate it ""Not for Kids"" but give Sunset Overdrive (with its much more abrasive content) a more lenient review.
The Master Chief Collection is a compilation of the Halo games 1-4. This series revolutionized the first person shooter genre and its influence can still be seen today. The Halo games wonderfully mix narrative with sci-fi action in a way that has always sucked me in. I love this universe and the story at the heart of it.
When looking at this collection there are a tons of components to consider. You're dealing with four different games. The first game Halo:Combat Evolved contains the most profanity of any but it is light compared to the vast majority of games out there. As you play through the four campaigns you'll notice the profanity dwindle considerably. In fact, I would venture to say that all four games combined have less profanity than almost any action game you'll find (Destiny aside).
Being a shooter you can expect violence. The are little splats of blood here and there including neon blue splotches for the aliens (known as the Covenant). There are no exploding heads or graphic dismemberments to be worried about. It is worth noting that a mutated ""race"" known as The Flood make a few scattered appearances and that are quite hideous. They are more creepy than grotesque but they do contribute to the games violence.
There is also a ton of multiplayer set for online or offline. They come in co-op or competitive forms. As with any online game there is content to be aware of particularly the language that comes from other players. But there are precautions that take that out of the equation for concerned parents.
The Master Chief Collection is a Halo lover's dream. It has a bit of strong language mainly in the early campaigns and some shooter violence. But Halo has long been considered one of the tamer M rated games and parents shouldn't lump it in with so many of the other shooters that feed on graphic violence and boat loads of profanity."
s,There are PG movies worse than this Have no idea why this 18 when all other games (except 4 which is the tamest in the series; and that includes the T rated Halo 5) are rated lower.
s,"The best game ever? Halo is probably the greatest game series to ever exist, its up there with other S-Tier games like ""Half Life"", ""Fallout"", and ""Minecraft"". But the problem is, if you play this game, you've reached the top of your gaming experience. It doesn't get much better than this, so may as well play the mediocre games before you play this, because once you spend an hour on this, you will never be the same.
P.S: Call Of Duty is nothing compared to halo :3"
a,"increible collection of games, but absolute gore-fest. halo is a timeless masterpiece, but be warned cos it can het very graphic, enemies will bleed, explode, and get stabbed and killed in countless ways, its no doom, but there is an insane amount of blood. sgt johnson also swears a lot, with b words s words, but no f bombs. however the flood is on a whole other level,their limbs will come off, its horrifying to watch, and they could be considered light horror."
s,just get it get it
s,12+ Ah yes.All the Halos on one disc.I say 10+ for all the singular halos but 13 for this one just cause it might be a little too much for a kid to take at once.
s,"Fine, but know what you are getting into. My opinion of this game is basically that it should have a varying rating for different aspects of the game. I think that for the most part the main bit of the game is actually quite tame. While there is certainly a great deal of fighting and shooting and violence, I also think that it is well tempered by the fact that a) You play as a robot, and b) Your enemies are mostly aliens. I personally decided that I would rate this game as if it were a movie and so, looking at some of the relatively similar shows out there (Pacific Rim, X-Men, The Avengers, just to name a few) in which you watch people blowing up aliens, shooting other people and so on. Seeing as all the movies I listed were rate d PG-13, I would award the same rating to this series.
My only problem with the game is that you can play online if you pay some extra money. The multiplayer version seems much more brutal in general, so I think that my above rating applies mainly to people without access to these extra features."
s,"the best video game collection yet. This thrilling first person sci-fi shooter has blown me away for the 5th time. It's one thing to re-experience halo games from the early xbox and PS generation. But playing Halo 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 back to back in one flawless collection is outstanding! But That's not all that the halo master chief collection has in store, it is also great for kids 12 and up. It is less violent than other first person games (battlefield, call of duty, Ec) The reason for this is because it focuses purely on gameplay and story line, concluding in no over the top violence. Not to mention the fact that you rarely ever kill humans. But unfortunately halo is still rated M. and for good reasons to, while the point of the game is to kill aliens (not humans) gore and blood can still be seen. which is why this game is suggested for mature 12 year olds or 13 and up. Also for any parents that worry about sexual, drinking,drugs, causing you have little to fear. Although causing is in the gameplay it is used rarely and at reasonable times."
s,"An amazing collection Common Sense Media seriously made this bundle sound a lot worse than it sounds. The violence is all against aliens, who bleed purple and blue blood. Occasionally red blood can be seen, mostly in the multiplayer modes. There is, however, an alien race known as the Flood, who mutate people into space zombie things. While not too violent, it may scare younger players. These creatures lose limbs when killed, but the blood is a dark green. The games do have some language, but it's nothing worse than b***h. The language is mostly present in the first two games, but three and four are pretty tame. Halo 4 does feature assassinations that involve stabbing aliens or neck snapping, but none are particularly bloody. Language is most prominent in the online modes, but chat can be disabled. All in all, this bundle is really not too bad, it's just dependent on how mature your kid is."
s,"Really fun and enjoyable game. You shoot aliens, lots of different weapons, vehicles, I don't know what's not to like! When you kill the aliens, or your teammates on accident (or on purpose) There are small bits of blood, the blood only appears on the ground and there is no blood spurts or anything like that. And the blood of the aliens are a blue-ish colour, but your human soldiers are normal blood. Sometimes when your NPC teammates killed an alien they would say bad words (but not swears) like As*, Sl**, Co**, Bit** or Bast***. But in a few cutscenes in some of the games they do swear (Sh** and I'm pretty sure once they put a Fu** in there.) For drug references, in some cutscenes some soldiers are smoking those a big cigarette, not much else. If the game is too hard there are four different difficultys. Easy, Medium, Heroic and Legendary. All of the Halo games. Halo: CE, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, Halo 4 and Halo: Reach. And when the next Halo games come out it will be here too! Also for people that played Halo back then when it was first out in 2001 or something there is a button (the two square button beside the menu button for Xbox one) to change it so it's the original version, because they have upgraded Halo CE and Halo 2 to look better. Hope this helped!"
s,"Amazing Game for kids and teens The expert review is really exaggerating. This should be rated T, not M. It's perfect for kids and teens and Master Chief (the main character) is a great role model(he saves humanity multiple times). Some of the cutscenes may be a bit violent, and in Halo CE and Halo 2 there's a lot of blood (the blood looks very cartoony and fake though). The violence is pretty tame, and is equivalent to Star Wars. Overall, if your kid is brave, this would be perfect for them!"
a,"The Ultimate Halo Expierence Halo: The Master Chief Collection contains six games in the long- running franchise. It's safe to say that this is the best way to experience the Halo games from the great stories, to the addicting multiplayer. This is the best bundle for both new and old fans. Although this bundle has been out for years, the PC version has recently released with tons of new updates.
Halo: Combat Evolved
The first ever Halo game was Combat Evolved, it released in 2001 and offered a campaign along with multiplayer. The game also comes with the remastered edition (Halo Anniversary), which upgrades the graphics and audio. The game is great, and is definitely worth playing through. However, the game may be boring for a younger audience as its very old and doesn't contain a lot of modern features that you'd see in an FPS game today. With that being said, I would definitely suggest you play this. The game doesn't have any sex but it does have some blood. Language is minor.
Halo 2:
The second Halo game also comes a remastered version. In fact, the graphics have been increased so much to the point where the cutscenes almost look like a movie. The gameplay is very similar with some minor changes, and there is a new campaign to play through. Like the previous game, Halo 2 contains violence and language.
Halo 3:
Unlike the past two games, Halo 3 does not come with a remastered version. The graphics however, still look good and hold up today. This game wraps up the campaign that the other two games started, with an epic finale. As with its predecessors, you shoot and blow up more aliens.
Halo 3: ODST
ODST was the prequel to Halo 3. It offered a short, but fun campaign. It's still worth playing through, but know that it's only a DLC to Halo 3, not a full game.
Halo: Reach
The next game in the series was Reach. This game was much darker and grittier than past Halo games. Although Master Chief isn't present, you still get a fantastic campaign with wonderful characters. It had a great co-op and multiplayer as well, offering same of the best gameplay from Halo game yet. It's more violent than the past games, with lots of deaths and injuries that are shown throughout the story. It isn't too bad, but it's something to keep in mind.
Halo 4
The final game in The Master Chief Collection (so far), is Halo 4. This definitely isn't the best game in the series but that doesn't mean it isn't worth playing. It has good graphics and gameplay with a decent storyline. The amount of violence and language is similar to the past games.
Conclusion:
Whether you're a newcomer or a returning fan, Halo: The Master Chief Collection is by far the best way to experience Halo. You get access to all of the campaigns and multiplayers for only $40! Updates are still coming out, and the player base is very active. This is also a way to get excited for Halo: Infinite (the upcoming game in the franchise), and catch you up on the story. It's not too violent, and definitely is something a young teen could handle. 100% worth buying.
Recommended for ages 12+"
a,"Very Good Game, Quite a bit of language This is one of my favorite games of all time. This is a collection of
Halo:CE, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 3:ODST, Halo Reach and Halo 4. Halo Reach and ODST are paid extras. The main part of the game are the campaigns (story modes). All of the games together is about 40 levels (I think). Each game is about 10-13 levels. The older games can be really difficult and frustrating, but you can change the difficulty settings. There is quite a bit of swearing in the campaigns. Includes d*nm, h*ll, b*tch, sh*t and b*stard. The last 3 are barely used but the first 2 are used a lot. There is a voice and text chat option in the main menu and during a game, so you may experience profanity from other players. You can, however, turn on chat filtering (text) if you don't want to see those words. Now let's talk about violence. In the campaigns (and some other modes) you are playing as a Master Chief: a Spartan devoted to protecting Earth from any hostiles. You can kill marines, but you will be punished by doing so. You mainly only kill aliens. In Halo:CE, Halo 2 and Halo 3, there is a zombie type creature called the flood. They aren't too scary, but how they attack is taking control of a dead body and using it against it's will. When you shoot or punch an enemy, blood will splatter out, but it's a very small amount. When they die, there will usually be a splatter of blood on the ground, but it is not too gruesome, and since you will mostly be killing aliens, the blood will usually be orange or blue (looks like kool-aid). Whenever you melee an enemy from behind, you will play an animation where you use a knife to stab them. This animation actually doesn't have any blood during it. You can use a plasma based sword, but it never dismembers anything. You can use a variety of weapons. Some military type weapons that shoot bullets, and some alien weapons that usually shoot plasma. You can also use grenades, which include a frag grenade, plasma grenade, and fire grenade (only Halo 3). The only ""sexual"" theme I can think of is Cortana. Cortana is an AI that guides and assists Master Chief in almost all of his games. She is nude, but it does not show anything explicit. But in Halo 4 her breasts and butt are more exaggerated than any of the other games. It is pretty easy to learn the basics, as there is a tutorial type level every campaign, but things can get very difficult as you turn the difficulty up. Playing online can also be very frustrating, but there is a system that finds matches with players around the skill level as you.
Overall, MCC (Master Chief Collection) is one of my favorite games of all time, and I would definitely recommend to anyone. I would say the minimum age to play this would be around 13, because of all the language, but it really depends on the maturity of your kid. Have fun!"
a,"Fantastic collection of some of the greatest shooters of all time First off, I have only played the multiplayer and the CE campaign, as well as a couple halo 4 levels, so I have not played through the entire thing, but from what i have played, it is a great game with a fantastic multiplayer and a good campaign. it does have a fair amount of violence and some blood, and you can shoot NPC soldiers on your side in the campaign, but not nearly as much violence as Call of Duty or other hyper-realistic military shooters. From what I have heard, there is some infrequent language such as H*ll, d*mn, *ss, and sh*t but no f-bombs. overall, I think this is a great game for mature 13 year olds, and that it is very mild for an m game"
s,Not as bad as Call of Duty or Battlefield. The Master Chief Collection includes the first four Halo games featuring The Master Chief. The violence is the main part of the games but it is not bad. There is a tiny bit blood but if you did not know that it was there you would not notice it. I think there might be one or two curse words throughout the whole four games and they very mild like damn and ass. There are no drugs or any other things to worry about. The controls are simple and Master Chief is brave and selfless and would do anything to save mankind. Brilliant games! 9+.
s,How to solve violence I haven't played the entire thing but I haven't heard a f bomb and this is not as violent as call of duty.The most mild M rated game to date.Now if you are still not convinced.You can play in any order of the games.Play all the levels first and then tell your child which ones to skip if they are to violent or have other things in it.If you won't let them plat the story then buy it for the multiplayer where it hardly even has ketchup blood.If your child has played any M game before then this is okay for your child that is a very mature 9/10 year old and a mature 11 year old they can play.
s,False ESRB Rating The M Rating I’m this game is completely wrong cause there’s nothing in this collection that would receive an M Rating Should Simply Be T Rated.
s,"Amazing collection as of 2019 This game is absolutely amazing. For anyone who is a fan of Halo, you can play all the games (except Halo 5) in 4K, 60FPS, and with Halo: CE, and Halo 2 anniversary as a bonus. This collection has all the multiplayer and campaigns from the originals with a very good player base. This game does contain blood, and some swearing, but most of the time these are to the low. The flood might be scary for younger players, and most of the blood is orange, blue or purple. Fine for older kids and younger teens."
s,ok fo 7 and up IT IS FINE LET THEM PLAY IT
s,"pretty appropriate this game has very little swearing with no f bombs and the swearing is only in campaign (2 star) but there are zombie like creatures that are mangled humans almost (only in h1-h3 campains h2 doesnt have much flood though) in h1 you can use graphics that has a ton of blood but the blood is unrealistic and looks like someone sprayed an entire can of cyan or purple spray paint on those graphics (in all other games there is barely any noticeable blood, there is a violent cutscene in h4 campain but other than that and reach having some blood this game is pretty ok(3 star) cortana looks iffy in h4 (1 star for sexual stuff) in the master chief games (i know what your thinking but you can get reach and odst as dlc and those games dont have master chief) master chief is always putting his life on the line for humanities sake and in reach there are some sacrifices to save reach and in odst the entire team searches for the lost rookie in the first half of the game before giving up and upholding the mission, 4 star on great role models and 5 on great messages) the games are also really similar in gameplay and controls (4 star easy to use) but the consumerisim is out of hand with many books that will interest you and infinite coming out will mean you'll have to spend 20$ on a game thats not even good (unlike every other halo game) just to get hyped and you will need to buy books and comics and even a tv show on halo waypoint just to understand whats happening in h4 as well as h5 wich you also have to buy but h1-3 and odst and reach are all really stand alone without needing to buy or rent 5 or 6 books/comics/shows&amp;movies to now the basis of the story unlike h4&amp;h5 i should also say i have not finished h4 spartan ops but i assume its appropriate as well overall ages 9+ for mature children 10/11+ for normal children and maybe 12+ for immature children (the m rating is a mistake almost every single other m rated game should be avoided till 14 or 15 unless your child is as mature as me and then its probably an 13+ thing for other m rated games (i forgot that a character in h1-h3 and odst does smoke a cigar bringing the smoking to 1 star)"
a,"Best FPS Halo Master chief collection is great, the flood is a bit disturbing though so not for kids under 11. but in other ways its great and i gotta say 343 is only good at making textures but its still good and i love shooting people and aliens because im a freaking psychopath"
a,"Amazing at first... Then it gets boring. When I first bought my Xbox One, I was extremely excited about this game. I mean, what could go wrong, with four games for the price of one (or 1.5 for that matter). Well, it turns out it's not that great. Sure, at first, it was a blast, just killing aliens and having fun... But after a while... It lost its appeal, and pretty fast. The multiplayer is really very bad, especially after playing games like Call of Duty, and the weapons you get to use as Master Chief are very underwhelming.
Parents: you should know that this game IS violent, after all it's a first-person shooter. But it isn't as bad as many people say it is (CSM included). Sure, you use tons of weapons, from shotguns, assault rifles, pistols, grenades, rocket launchers and a variety of vehicles to mow down your foes. There is a little blood, easily ignored, no gore, and few cuss words, the most notable of these ""son of a b*tch"". No sex to worry about, one character smokes constantly. It should be ok for teens. If you let your child play Destiny or Titanfall, this has about the same amount and type of violence.
So, to sum it up, buy this if your kid likes FPS games. If he just plays multiplayer, then you should start looking towards Overwatch, maybe."
s,"Whoever Gave The Age Rating Needs Help Every Halo game is not violent enough to get an M. Think about it, Halo being 17+?!?! That's ridiculous. Maybe ODST is enough to receive an M, but thinking about how non-realistic the game is, hardly would be enough. A mashup of 1, 2, 3, ODST, and 4 was such an amazing idea. Definitely buy."
s,"My Second Favourite Game Of All Time (This Review Will Be For The Campaign Because I Don't Play The Online Multiplayer)
Halo ce: i Haven't Finished the campaign yet but from what i've played i'd rate the anniversary graphics 13+ nothing too bad but theres a scene where an elite has it's stomach open it's pretty brief but may scare some younger players, the flood aren't as bad as i thought they'd be tbh in old graphics they look almost comical because some of them look like they have an arm as a head, the scene where the elite has it's stomach open is not graphic in old graphics so i'd rate old graphics 10+
halo 2: i have only played halo 2 in the old graphics and i'd rate the old graphics for 12+ the flood look quite a bit scarier in halo 2 than they did in halo ce, in halo ce they looked kinda stupid but in halo 2 they look a lot more like zombies which may scare some players
halo 3: 12+ the only thing that could scare people in halo 3 (in my opinion) is that you can see people being turned into the flood it's not graphic but it may scare some players
halo 4: 12+ only one scene that could possibly scare people and that is when the didact fires a weapon (forgot the name) that melts the scientists layer by layer althoguht kinda violent it's very brief
(i haven't played reach or odst)"
s,"Awesome People keep saying that if a game is rated M, you should wait until you can play it. My dad let me start playing it recentley, and let me tell you, it's awesome. Yes, They do say some bad stuff, but they are marines. Also there is some blood, but it's alien blood most of the time. If you already have like one game, then this consists of all the games you need to play in order. It also has multiplayer. Just show your mom or dad this review, and I hope everyone has as much fun playing it as I do."
s,"An All Time Favorite This game is amazing and perfect for kids that are getting too old for those little kid games (e.g. Minecraft) but not old enough for Adult or Teen games. The only thing concerning about this game is the extremely mild language, which is hard to hear aside from all the gunshots and explosions. The violence is minimal and is a little janky, blood doesn't look real and the main thing you're trying to kill is aliens. This is a great game and no matter how old it is, it really is a gem."
s,"Parents, Read THIS Review. I don’t want to make this too long, but I must. I’m a 12 year old kid who has been playing halo for 7 years, and my life has changed for the best. (I made an account on common sense media and set my age to 17, but don’t believe that I’m actually 12.) | Halo is probably the most appropriate gun game you can ever let your child play. I have played Halo: CE, Halo: 2, Halo: 2A, Halo: 3, Halo: 4, Halo: 5 Guardians, and Halo: Infinite. I have spent much of my life playing this game and I have absolutely no regrets. To answer the adult questions: “is it violent though?” Yes. There are military weapons such as shotguns, assault rifles, snipers, battle rifles, grenades, and much more. It is very violent, however, it’s a game that wouldn’t pollute your child’s brain to the point where they want to pretend to kill people. They will grow an obsession towards guns like I have, however, it’s not a bad thing. Your only fighting aliens. There is blood, but enough that you can only see blood the size of a penny when you melee a dead body. Aliens dispense blue Gatorade as blood, so it could be considered not inappropriate. There are bad words such as b****, and sh**, and h***. If you don’t want your child hearing bad words, then there’s a problem, unless they can hear a few bad words every 10 hours of gameplay. The game is also very addicting, and contains no gore. Overall, perfect for clean children. Also don’t let your kids play Call of Duty. It’s very inappropriate, it contains lots of blood and gore, tons of bad words, nazis, lingerie, and about any thing you wouldn’t want your kids to see."
s,"Not bad There is never any ""blowing people in pieces with gernades"", blood is minimal, and you are killing to save human lives."
a,rating can be a little to violent when it comes to the flood but you can maybe turn off the blood or at least the gore. you can also maybe turn off the swearing in this master chief collection. the main thing for sex would be Cortana.
a,"Not for children WoW is great fun for adults 18+, assuming you can limit your time in the game fantasy world and not become addicted to it, as millions do; but I can't imagine letting my kids play it. It's simply far too violent; and graphically violent, at that.
It's not a sociopath training game, like Grandtheft Auto or Call of Duty: it's more like Lord of the Rings or classic Dungeons and Dragons - a classic fantasy adventure centering upon quests and battling monsters. But the violence makes it unsuitable to kids under 18, in my view.
Mind you, much of what kids are watching and playing now, I don't think they should be watching or playing - and I feel very strongly about it. Kids are exposed to far too much violence via TV, video games and movies.
Assuming you are playing for The Alliance, which is the loosely-speaking good faction, and not role playing a goblin warlock for The Horde, for example, feeding off the souls of the hated humans and summoning demons as helpers and friends, which seems more than a little twisted to me, World of Warcraft is a great game, if you're an adult (with a life outside the game world) - but it's not for kids, I would say.
The main issue with kids playing any video game, to my mind, is, as with TV, smart phones, tablets and computers, how much time they spend staring into a screen, largely disconnected from the real world of lived experience. A one hour a day, or seven hour a week time limit should be strictly kept, I would urge. Kids and adults should read books, interact face to face with others, get outside, and stay physically active. But content is a serious issue, too.
There is a difference between Dora the Explorer and Kill Bill. Some games, TV shows and films are suitable for kids. WoW is not one of them."
a,"Good for all ages,but good for all families by 11. I'm a 9 years old and my family and I play WoW all the time.It's dark and kind of violent.It doesn't teach much and it's a little sexist, but I started playing it and I couldn't get off the computer! It's fun and you get desensitized quickly."
s,"Great Game! And enhances critical thinking! Great game, not like violent war games, but a creative and daring fun game that helps broaden teens minds!"
s,WoW is a amazing game WoW is a popular MMO that involves multiplayer that can be very complex at max level and involves very high levels of teamwork with other players which can be go good for kids. The game revolves around working with other people and since their is a no instant level 90 boost new players can play with friends faster without having to level up to level 90 then 100.
s,"Old WoW brought back? General game appropriate for kids There's a lot to go over here, so I'll try to stick to the site format. Sex: innuendo, the odd quest to bring two lovers together. The biggest issue is scantily clad women-nearly every piece of armor is midriff and chest revealing, and women are shown with very voluptuous bodies in all races. Drinking: Quests can include purchasing, drinking, or finding alcohol, to the point of drunkenness. Has no effect on others. Language: Appropriate to the time period. ""bastard"" ""damn"" not in excess. Consumerism: Certain character stereotypes are all about money, but that's just the way they are. Many items in the game, as well as expansions, cost money, so it's easy to spend on. Messages: Lots of moral choices, light vs. dark, necromancy, good vs evil: is the Horde really that evil? is the Alliance really that good? You can't do things like murder innocents and steal, because the environment isn't very interactive, like with most MMOs. Violence? Repetitive, but unrealistic. I'm a bit of a sword nerd so maybe I'm overdoing it, but I've never seen ONE video game that gets sword fighting right. Occasional blood, and many destructive spells, including turning into animals, summoning demons, using huge fire waves, etc., but still a bit cartooned and not realistic.
In conclusion: Great game. One of the greatest fantasy epics ever. SO much indescribable lore, creative stories and creatures..... you can't describe it on a few paragraphs. Fine for anyone 11 and up... however, you must watch to be sure they don't get overly violent tendencies, and understand it's just a game (this is easier as kids age). Also, people who play lots of video games can be addicted. If kids especially spend too much time absorbed, their behavior becomes poor, as do grades and sleep/eating habits. Your greatest concern is to limit game time until kids can be responsible. Use it as a reward for chores. Limit to about an hour. That's it, folks! Fine for kids, but just don't let them go into it with reckless abandon, and discuss themes and so on. Also, DISCUSS ONLINE SAFETY! Millions of people play the game. Teach kids to be responsible and safe online."
s,"The gore just doesn’t look like gore There are dead bodies and red and green blood, but the gore is incredibly limited by the art style, which is pixel art. Think of it this way: on games with realistic graphics, you have over 2 million pixels to make a gory image. In pixel art, you have about 256 pixels for all you gory needs, 8,000 times less detail.
The aim of the game is to kill mutant monsters with guns. And while this sounds scary in writing, the game’s scariness factor is very limited by the pixel art. You can vaguely make out that the guns are guns, and the mutants are squared off and not at all scary.
One thing to note: the 5/5 ease of play score is deceiving. While the controls are easy to master, the game is built around punishing failure by loosing all progress in the game and having to restart from the beginning. This can be incredibly frustrating because you can have good weapons and upgrades but mess up and be sent back to square one. If your child has a lower tolerance for anger, stay away from this game."
a,"Hard, cartoonishly violent game satisfies I play some hard games. Mirror's Edge, Portal 2, Undertale (the bullet hell can be difficult) and this. But I have invested 50 hours and have gotten to the throne room twice. Only twice. Seven levels, each with three in it, 7 times 3 is 21 plus the four throne room levels is 25. 25 levels and I've only gotten to the 22nd in 50 hours. This game is really hard. Crystal is good for starters though, and once you unlock her Chicken is excellent. But the age. Now if this was realistic (still top-down) it would get T easily. It's E10 because of its cartoony graphics, which I think fits the bill very well. It's rated so for Fantasy Violence (if it was realistic and a first-person shooter, it would get M so quickly for Intense Violence but if it stayed top down and was realistic it would be Violence) Mild Blood (Yeah some red pixels and some green ones occasionally. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT) and Mild Language. I've played my 50 hours and I heard hell a couple times. It's also in the names of the levels (Hell is the name of one level, along with things like Fish Can Roll and Family and such and that's only where it's ever heard) It's overall appropriate if you let your kid play E10 games. Although you wouldn't be here if you did. But the PS Vita version I believe is T, but has the same content....? I don't know. But 10 and up is fine. WARNING: You will be spamming left mouse click a ton, which is fire. There are a ton of enemies in each level, and you must kill all of them, so the violence is very frequent."
a,For 15+ This is a very good game with a good plot. The definitive edition cuts out some unnecessary nudity compared to the original. moderate suggestive themes and moderate gore.
a,"Great game mechanics oversaturated with gross out sex and gore. I hated the original DMC, but came around when Devil May Cry 2 came out, then 3, then 4 was HD but not quite as good and more repetative. OK. The controls are tight as ever with the familiar frantic hack and slash gameplay, which hasn't changed a ton, but has some new toys that become easy to get a handle on. There IS a 'use the right color weapon' mechanic that is gleened from cheesier games and make certain segements a tedious 'color match' fight,but it doesn't ruin it, just bogs down the experience for a minute making you want to just 'get through it'. The bosses are huge and on par with the series and definitely a highlight and the henchmen critters are satisfying to dispatch on a regular basis minus an annoying one or 2. You have scythes, swords, guns and Hulk Hand fists to punch with making it diverse but often pigeon holed to using certain items. The BIG downer is this is STRICTLY not for younger players. I hate this about the game but it is extremely gross. One section has a demon come from his mothers youknowwhat while still attached. These moments are not persistant, but do leave a stain and a memory that anyone playing will most likely never shake, and to marketting, that's probably the idea. It seems like a waste to take a great game and narrow it down to an audience willing to put up with grotesqueries in order to play. Perhaps it would be wise for them to cut 5 minutes out of the game for an optional PG 13 version, but that's not likely to ever happen. And although the hyper sexed game Bayonetta is extremely exploitative and borrows many of DMCs ideas, THIS game is the worst in the genre and in the series by far."
a,Violent hack and slash for mature teens This game revolves around dante. A demon who kills other demons because they are more eviler or something. There is some language but nothing too much. Some sexual innuendo.
a,"Remaster is much improving and better than original This remaster is great as it adds skins from past Devil May Cry games. Violence is the same but slightly more high definition, and long combos can be intense and bloody. Black blood splatters, via slicing, evisceration,decapitating and shooting your way through demons. Strong language is unnecessarily frequent at times; @$$, b!#ch, d*ck, f#!k, $h!t and wh*re. Sexuality is occassional. Strippers in provocative clothing, partial nudity, unseen intercourse and implied sex."
s,"Pretty good game about the wild west has alot of unrealistic violence So this game is good, it's fun on normal but the game gives you an option to do multiplayer, so fir starters the violence isn't that bad, its pixelated and very unrealistic, but you do it alot, people can also drink smoke and gamble which if you have a problem with those things than it might be sort of an issue but like I said, it's not realistic. They might swear in text every now and then but nothing past ""Damn""."
s,"Fun, easy goals, no anxiety All around great.
Only thing I would change is make the sheep not drown if you drag them into the sea."
s,"Fun Very fun, and challenging, try it! Story line is that you are a robot sent to a planet growing a special plant to your spaceship to study-ish and you also discover animals and plants. Pretty fun game. You should think about it!"
a,"some incest content Great game, no explicit sexual content, however references to sex and sexual acts that are incestuous do occur, which may be triggering for certain viewers."
a,"Very good It has quite violent and sexual themes, but they are just that, themes. The whole game is just her talking so it's not to bad."
a,"Great Modern Murder Mystery Her Story is a very unique game. As the review states it isn't so much a video game than it is an interactive movie. The story revolves around your character (who is better not being named,as it could spoil the story slightly) searching through a police database for information about the 1994 murder of Simon Smith. This plot element plays out with the player searching keywords in a database, and watching videos of a detective interviewing suspects in the crime. While the review suggest this game is 16+ I would personally say that it could be 14+ depending on the maturity of the player. In the interviews the suspects use profanity, and describe several sexual and violent acts, if a child can handle that, then they shouldn't have a problem with this game. The game itself has a very unique and intriguing story that only ever ends when you believe you know what happened, and even after this you'll be left wondering if you interpreted the story correctly and you may play it several times before you truly feel like you know everything about the story. While the game's story is very good, it can be boring to some people, as the gameplay really only compares to typing something in a search bar and then watching videos. If that isn't your thing, you might think twice about spending $20 on this game. Overall I would rate the game 4/5 for its intriguing story that will leave you wanting more."
s,"Not bad A pretty good game, but not at all like the original King's Quest games. Stick to the classics."
s,"Surprisingly not made by Telltale games If you are familiar with game by Telltale, you will be right at home with this interesting interactive story based game. Violence is mild and in a fantasy manner. Graham can ""die"" but not for real(due to the story teller's faulty memory), and a another knight does get killed by a dragon, but not in a graphic or very violent manner. Language is mild and very rare; ""damn""."
a,"Microsoft Finally Gets It Right I'm a Forza veteran, and this is by far the best of the series, not just for the improved graphics and tons of content, but for subtle gameplay adjustments that make the game feel rewarding whether you're just starting out or have been playing for months.
Bottom line - if you or your kids have any interest in racing games, you should pick this one up. By turning various Assists off or on, you can make the game as hard or as easy as you like, and you can handicap better players to even the odds between you and your kids. And, unlike the Forza Horizon games, Forza 6 still features split-screen multiplayer, so you can compete with someone on the same couch, not just online. There are, however, three concerns that parents might have with this game. 1) Open multiplayer chat. Like most online games, the chat is not monitored. In my online experience, the majority of players online seem to be adults, or at least teenagers. In a game where you can crash into people, spin them out, or run them off the road, tempers can flare and the language can get fairly abrasive. However, there is a great multiplayer mode in the game called Ghost League, where collisions are turned off. All your opponent cars are semi-translucent, and you simply drive through them. If someone runs off the road or crashes, it's no-one's fault but their own, so the tempers are decidedly cooler and cursing is a rarity. 2) Advertising. Like real auto racing, ads are everywhere - on billboards, footbridges, guard walls, and the cars. There are a few scattered ads that your kids might have some interest in (e.g. Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Sargento Cheese, etc...), but the VAST majority are for car companies or car-related products (e.g. Mobil 1 oil). Your kids won't even give them a second thought. ""But, MOM, why can't we get Recaro seats for the minivan?!?"" Any remotely objectionable ads are only on the cars (e.g. Marlboro, Jack Daniel's), not the racetracks, and they are few and far between. 3) Mature Car Designs; or rather, immature car designs. There is a burgeoning community of people who create ""Vinyls"" (i.e. stickers or decals) and whole car designs (i.e. paint jobs), which you can easily download, change, or use to make your own. The majority are racing-oriented liveries, but they run the gamut from the abstract, to superheroes, SpongeBob, and Holiday themes. There is, however, a trend for (mostly) Japanese cars to sport anime/manga-style girls on them. Some are quite tame, of the Final Fantasy or Pokémon variety, but other cars are draped with doe-eyed females of impossible proportions and dubious legal age, straining their skimpy bikinis to the limit. Most of these require a dedicated search to find (or so I've heard...ahem), but a few of the more well-done ones can occasionally show up in the default assortment of available paint jobs you are presented with when you buy a car. Your eight-year old probably won't care, but your teen will definitely take notice. It's actually quite remarkable that these and all the other designs were painstakingly created using the game's simple painting controls, but it's amazing what you can accomplish when you put several thousand (or more) polygons and other simple shapes together."
s,Nothing to worry about in this beautiful racing game. The only thing in this game to even consider is the advertisement. Ads on signs ect.
s,"Best racing game I've ever played!! This is the best racing game I've played! It's sometimes underrated and deserves to be over Mario kart! There's multiplayer racing online but if you block them with a parental controls, it shouldn't be a problem. Overall the most well made racing game I've played or seen. Get your kids this!!!"
s,Simba goes to battle with an evil lion queen named Forza. She wants to kill him and Nala so she can be queen. (Don't worry Simba kills her).
s,"Best racing simulator on console! (barring Forza Horizon 4) Forza Motorsport 6 is my favorite Forza Motorsport game. The driving quality is superb, the sounds and cars and tracks are realistic, and cars are customizable in any and all ways. Forzavista is an easy way to explore your car, inside and out. A lot of popular cars are presented here, and they all drive exceptionally well. Keep in mind there is plenty of DLC content, and if you're a fan of Porsche or NASCAR, then you'll have to cough up $20 a piece for expansion content. Just for that reason, I'd recommend playing Forza Motorsport 7 instead, because Porsches are included in the base game. Overall, this is the best racing simulator out there right now"
s,"Forza 6 racing game Forza 6 is one of the greatest racing games. Forza 6 is appropriate and fun for all ages, and you can have fun for hours. But the bad thing is that you need to earn money in the game to get cool cars, and that is why I would rate this 4/5."
s,Great game! 10+ is ridiculous because there is NOTHING bad about this game. Awesome game that will make kids love cars!
s,"Forza Motorsport 6 - Cannot Ask For Better Forza Motorsport 6 is the best racing simulator of its age. I simply have nothing​ I would change about it. The community based around it is amazing, however parents allow me to warn you, this game is also very popular with adults, so make sure you keep safe! Anyways, the graphics are out of this world, I thought Horizon was good but I then saw this and it blew my head off! With customisable controls, whatever car you have can be tamed by anybody. To be quick and say if you should get it providing you have at least a mild interest in cars and amazing games - GET IT!"
s,Best racing game I've ever played!! 
s,"This Kicks Butt This compilation has all the important NES Mega Man games and represents them quite well. The graphics are 1-1, the gameplay is top banana and should only be reserved for the most hardcore of gamers as the Mega Man series is world renowned for it's difficulty. If you have little kids, don't give them this game as it will make them get angry."
s,"Amazing, but might be a little hard This game consists of 6 amazing classics that every kid should play. i full-heartedly recommend this game, however be aware that the difficulty might be too hard for little kids."
s,"Great and difficult collection of games. I might have played these games on mobile, but that shouldn't change on what I think of them.
Anyways,these games are very great and feature nothing particularly inappropriate for kids other than how hard they are(I never finished Mega Man 3 because of that stupid final boss.) and some pixellated action."
s,"Mega man—classic games still fun Super fun, albeit very difficult, gameplay, much more cartoony and lighthearted than the X series. Robots shoot each other and explode"
s,"Still great, so many years later. Mega Man is a series that has aged masterfully, and there's no denying it.
Mega Man's formula of jumping and shooting is tough, and very difficult at times. But it's never the game's fault. It's fun, the game makes you learn in every stage, it's always fair, though. If your kids are old enough to handle the difficulty, the payoff is something you'll never find anywhere else today.
The game's legacy doesn't come from it's narrative, or anything else from that matter. It teaches you something- that things don't come easy, but it's always worth pursuing."
s,"Psychological horror. It really depends on how your child handles horror. There are some jump scares, but the game is mostly psychologically disturbing. Baby dolls creepily smacking their heads repetitively against things, disturbing (though not inappropriate) paintings, creepy noises and lights going out, etc. One minute you walk into a room, turn around and the door is gone behind you, or the hallways continue in an endless loop. The game is first person, about a mystery surrounding a murder, and the player is left to explore a haunted house. Lots of little puzzles in the rooms.
There is light drinking and some swearing in the game. No sex, some violence. Mostly just sort of disturbing.
My 11 year old loved it. The game even frightened me a little bit when me and my husband played it the first time around. I was a little hesitant to let my kid play it due to it maybe scaring her a little too much, but it turned out fine. If your child has frequent nightmares or is not accustomed to the horror genre yet, wait a few years or test the game out yourself, first."
a,"RATED16+horror,language,disturbing images PHYCOLOGICAL HORROR CONTAINS SCARE THEMES WITH INAPPROPRIATE LANGUAGE!HOWEVER NO VIOLENCE BUT BECAUSE OF AGGRESSION IT IS RATED AS TOO MUCH VIOLENCE"
a,"Great game but very dark Layers of fear is an absolutely great game in my opinion. However, it is very sad and partly disturbing. I think any horror fan should play it but here is the parent review:
Drugs: the main character is an alcoholic this is references many times and empty bottles are very common. 3/10
Sex: barely anything except a few portraits in which a baby’s buttocks can be seen and in one scene the artist makes slightly sexual remarks about his wife 2/10
Violence and gore: onscreen violence and blood is very uncommon. However, it is stated that the artists wife was severely deformed by a fire and her distorted ghost can be seen. A knife with Some blood near it is scene when it is said that the wife killed herself. A bloody series of drawings can be scene depicting little red riding hood. Not to bad. The game is mostly disturbing and not TOO much is seen. 5/10
Profanity: not that bad but a few instances of swearing in writing and dialogue. 3/10
Scariness: it is pretty disturbing and sad and contains many jump scares or loud noises. I didn’t jump much when playing it but it may stink with you. 7/10
It is a really good game and it depends on the kid. It may sound bad but give it a go."
s,"Honesty, depends on maturity of the kid. This game wasn't that bad. I liked it enough to by the VR port. It had it's tense moments. Pretty much the only thing that makes it M rated is that there's tiny, TINY bits of gore and then swearing. So if your child likes horror this is a good game. It is super super easy by the way. Its a story driven game, most of it is just walking and looking, not much actual gameplay."
a,"Repetitive but haunting psychological horror game is a jump-scare galore First of all, I cannot express enough how fantastic this horror game is. It boasts a tense atmosphere and is filled with unexpected jumpscares unlike other games. Yes it can get repetitive but the abject horror makes up for it. To the age rating,there is a lot of disturbing content that kids under 16 should take caution in seeing. The game focuses on mental illnesses as the main character has one. He sees creepy and unsettling visions which some are even violent. If you are under 16, take extreme caution playing this game."
a,"Really scary horror game. Not for people who have a weak heart.
This game is all about your phsychic."
a,"Beautifully scary; Artistic game has too many jump scares This is a disturbing and mind-bending game with rich and detailed graphics that deals with an Artist that has severe mental illness. Similar to the Silent Hill teaser, P.T., you walk through an old house full of paintings and illusions(although this one has many different rooms), and choose to solve puzzles and fine clues as you walk through the psychedelic rooms. Doing certain puzzles and finding clues may lead you to an alternative ending. My only complaint is that the jump scares can get a bit repetitive.
Violence: Scary/disturbing imagery, bloody drawings and paintings can be seen, and a few flashbacks have disturbing, although implied deaths and violence.
Sex/Nudity: No sex, although one flashback shows a sketch of a nude woman with the artist making menacing and suggestive comments on it, and a painting shows a child buttocks as he is being carried away by a bird.
Drugs/Alcohol/Smoking: Cigars are seen. The artist is implied to be an alcoholic.
Profanity: Some flashbacks have strong language."
a,"This game is top notch, amazing!!! I am the kind that doesn't get scared when it comes to horror, but there was the occasional time where i flinched. This game is actually kind of scary. This does have a little suggestive content though. I think 14+ would be the best age bracket."
s,"Amazing detail, gameplay and fun It's a perfectly appropriate game that just a little scary. I think that it should really be rated E10+"
s,EPIC!!! Very Good But The First Game Is Better
a,"Watch the ads! This is a great game and fun for most ages but I encourage adults to play it for awhile and see what kind of ads pop up. My 5 year old son was playing it and suddenly I heard, ""don't look that isn't proper!"" I took the tablet and an ad video showing pretty much naked anime girls hanging over half naked guys was playing. I am just glad I was there. I promptly deleted all snail bob games, its not worth it."
a,"This is not a game for young children. The game itself is a great game, but you when add in people on the internet it changes everything. There is a lot of ERP (erotic role players, sex chat)
None of the chat channels are monitored. The things people talk about in open chat channels make me cringe at the thought of some children are reading it.
You are constantly harassed by gold sellers who will hack your game account and credit cards.
You can turn off all chat and play but then it makes it almost impossible to participate in many game group features.
The game itself is great, but people on the internet can really ruin it for younger players."
s,"Great MMO for your little Star Wars Fan! Most MMOS aren't appropriate for kids, but Old Republic Changes that! It is
an amazing game, were you can choose from a smuggler, Jedi Knight, a Soldier, a Bounty Hunter, Sith lord and much more!"
s,"Good Minecraft based sandbox title with better graphics and modes than Minecraft There is no more violence than there is on Minecraft.
However, the game is beautiful compared to Minecraft and the gameplay much more fluid.
There is no nudity or bad language in this game.
Also all the crafting is logical, like for example when making a stone axe you need to gather wood and stone. Minecraft is not in that aspect.
A very good and cheap alternative that also supports gaming for LAN and online gaming with very easy setup.
I bought 3 lisences for my kids 6 and 8 and they are going crazy over it. I actually enjoy playing it too.
Think of it as a crossover between Minecraft and WoW without the violence, gore or language.
The games also offers progressive worlds (adventure mode) through it's smart Portal system that makes you revisit old world for materials. +on gameplay there.
One of the most kid friendly co-op titles out there."
s,"Building and adventure Our 5 and 8 year old love to play this. This is the game that taught our 5-year old to use all the buttons on the Xbox controller. After nearly a year this is still her favorite game.
You can play adventure mode, with monsters and quests (reading required to understand quests, but they aren't necessary), or you can play creative mode where you just build. A bit like Minecraft, but cuter graphics and music."
s,Very fun No blood or anything. very fun easy controls and similar to terraria and mine craft.
s,"Portal Knights Best thing This game is for kids and parents, it shows creativity and fun."
s,Portal Knights This is a great mix of puzzles and quests with a Minecraft / Wii sort of style to it.
s,"Mini Metro: an instant classic! I really do love Mini Metro. It's the best thing to happen to my iPad since Minecraft. Build metro systems, build more metro systems, unlock cities, everything about it is great! no pay-to-win features, just you and your map."
s,"This insanely fun game can be played by anyone Anyone can pick this up and learn to play in an instant. Playing this game feels like I'm a toddler a Chuckee Cheese. It's more complex than an arcade game, but it gives off the same vibe; easy, fun, and kid-friendly. I first played this when I was 10, and I'll play it till I'm 100. When I say easy, I mean easy to learn; there are definitely varying skill levels, but not so much that a gaming veteran like me can't lose to my 8-year-old nephew. I can't stress enough how fun this is. Also, I completely disagree with the age rating that CSM gave. Does a dude in a shark suit backflipping over a few cardboard boxes in 2D warrant an 'age 10 and up'? I'll leave that for you to decide. Thanks for reading! If you found this helpful check out some of my other reviews."
s,Great fun A good party game to play with friends
s,"Great Game To Play With Friends SpeedRunners is an silly, fun game to play with your friends. The gameplay is very fun, with each player racing against each other. The camera follows the player in first place and anyone who falls behind the ever-shrinking screen are out. The visuals are a cool homage to nineties superhero cartoons, the score is surprisingly excellent, although the campaign unfortunately is not very good. Nothing to worry about content-wise apart from a pipe-smoking dog. Overall SpeedRunners is a great party game that is better when played with friends."
a,"Toxic Overwatch Players I have been playing Overwatch for over a year. As everyone here has stated, the animated violence of this game is not bad at all. Much better than other games in this genre. There is one massive hole that I'm not seeing here that parents should be made aware of. The ESRB states that this game is rated ""Teen"". However, if you read a bit deeper you see ""Online Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB"". For parents that don't know, this game is ONLY online. I.e. they can't play it without other human players. Since this is an online game and ESRB does not rate online interactions one might assume that ""this is a good game for my teen"".
In short, some players in this game very toxic and your teen WILL be exposed to this. What do I mean by toxic? First off, the language. If any one character in the game said some of what these people say this would get smacked with an ""M"" (in some cases, worse). Some say that toxic players say things like ""too ez"" after winning a game, that is not what I'm talking about at all. Those people are just poor sports. Toxic players are much, much worse...
Second, insults and personal attacks are very common. The anonymity of the game (as with the web) brings out the worst in people.
I'd like to close with a few things:
* The toxic players are in every online game, even games like Minecraft. If your child plays online they are exposed to this.
* Blizzard has done some things that make it so blocking players doesn't work (no, you can't effectively block these toxic players because people were blocking ""good"" players). This is a choice Blizzard made. There is a ""block player"" command but I haven't seen it work, I still end up playing with people I've blocked...
* There is a reporting feature in Overwatch. I'll leave it up to the reader to do a Google search to determine how effective reporting this to Blizzard is.
* You can do some muting (voice and text). It has been my experience that this is near useless, especially in Competition where it is expected you have a mic (team communication is very important in this game). This is where most of the Toxic players end up. I don't play Competitive matches anymore. You are guaranteed a toxic player (very likely more than one; like on the school yard they ""gang up and feed off each other"").
I haven’t heard of anyone being banned from Overwatch for anything other than game modification (cheating). Blizzard knows if cheaters infest the game that people will leave. Either you cheat or you lose. To be clear, I can understand Blizzard’s position; a ban is major. Someone won’t be able to play the game anymore after buying it. But, perhaps, the solution isn’t to just throw up your corporate hands and say “well, there is nothing we can do” or “this is in every game so we won’t do anything”. More monitoring on the part of Blizzard is necessary.
I just wanted others to know that ESRB and the other statements here are correct but missing (IMHO) a very vital component which is the online play. Remember, this isn't just Overwatch (the only online game I play, likely the last). I’m sure all online games are like this but I would hope that other companies who support these games do a better job than Blizzard at dealing with these players.
Want some entertainment? Google ""youtube overwatch toxic player"" and watch a few. Then realize that those are the ones that got recorded, most don’t.
-------------------------
I would like to say, i went in to the blizzard control panel and blocked my sons (and my own) voice. I have tested for the last hour and I haven't heard a peep. While i've blocked players that are toxic in text chat, it is nowhere near as bad now that I have made it so that audio is completely blocked. It is a fun game, your kids will like it. You, as a parent, need to block this however."
a,"A great game, for older teens. As an adult all in all I think this is a great game. Honestly I love to waste time on it, it has many complex themes and a handful of good characters to aspire to be like.
Though, I am concerned about the amount of younger children who play this game. This is not a game for children. While at face value it's a friendly FPS the more you dive into the story side of the game there are themes of death and violence. The voice lines are usually tame, but some of the characters offhandedly mention alcohol to each other, threaten possibly killing each other and are generally at each others throats.
Also, the competitive mode is not a good place for children, as people can get very upset if someone is playing badly and begin shooting off at the mouth. Heck, I've heard children even being disrespectful and running their mouth on there. My suggestion is if you are going to let children play, don't let them have mics and go into the settings and turn off the chat options.
Online interactions are not rated by the ESRB, so treat it as a rated M game. People online will not hesitate to tease your kid, especially if they decide to run their mouth."
s,"PG Nothing bad, unless cartoon butz offend u"
a,"Google 'Overwatch Toxic Rage' before you let your kid play. I love this game. There is a diverse range of characters from all over the world of all different sexualities (and even species). There is very mild blood and only sparse swearing, smoking, and drinking).
That, however, is just the game itself. What isn't rated is the online interaction. This is a team based game. You are teamed up with 5 other random people to play against another assembled team. You have to be able to communicate with each other or gear up to lose a lot of games. When an 8 year old is on with an open mic and we can hear you screaming at your little darling in the background, it makes it really hard to coordinate your team. Then, the angry teammates will introduce your kid to a bunch of new slurs to use on the playground (and they are VERY creative).
They do have a blocking and reporting system (where the offender can get muted or even blocked forever), but by that time, the damage is already done. You can also put a profanity filter on the text chat, but the adults on the game are sly to that and have creative new spellings for their slurs and swearing.
If you want to toss all this aside and let little Billy play, then for the LOVE OF GOD do not let him play in Comp. It's a ranked system that boosts you up or down according to wins and losses. Even the best and most mature players can loose their cool at a loss due to some 12 year old playing Genji whining in the mic that he can't get heals.
They don't want little Billy there, and they will be happy to tell him what he can do with himself. Don't put your kid or the gaming community through that.
I put that it's good for 16+, but that's really if you think your 16 year old can handle being a gracious loser and not become more of the problem by toxicly screaming at others when they lose. I will report your kid. Happily and in great detail."
s,"Really fun game my son plays Basically, I wasn't sure about this at first when my son wanted to get it. But after watching it, decided to get it. I have played it a few times and is super fun, especially using Reaper and Widow maker. My son loves it. Some cleavlage and skin tight suits and some inappropriate custom private matches, along with mild blood if enemy is hit and very sci-fi weapons, with some being basically a unrealistic freezer gun that can shoot ice. Some mild swearing like hell and D*mn, but very rare. Again, very fun."
s,"Great game Overwatch is a great game if you want your kids to play video games but not ones that emphasize excessive violence. The game has no realistic characters or weapons so it is much better than most shooters. The only complaint I've seen is that the chat exposes your kids to toxic players but really if your kids have played any online games (Minecraft, Roblox, etc.) they've seen this before."
s,"Really 11 years old? I have no idea why this game is rated teen, no sense in it. there is like nothing bad in it unless you don't like guns. There is no blood no graphics no drinking or any of that no swearing no anything bad. So besides the guns this is like 2 and up, there is guns so 6 and up."
a,"it's great for an hour maybe 2 then you realize So I got this game due to all the hype and everyone I know saying it's amazing. It's true for the first ten games then you realized you wasted about 40-60$ as most free games have more content. No offline or anything other than pvp. (Which would be ok if it had waves of creeps, like don't 2 or league of legends. But nope sadly You Get nothing. Like the total amount of content if you wanted a moba.) But If you want to play a game where you walk around a corner and get instantly killed by someone looking the other way than yes game of the year.
Wasted good time on this and very happy I was able to get a refund. 10$ would be a fair price for the content. 20-40$ might be acceptable if they had a split screen, which they dont.
So if you want to play with you kid this game won't work, Also if you want to hear people yelling for your kid to get gud this is the game for you. talk about a toxic community. Even dota players are nicer.
Teen game with a mature community ( meaning M rated as they are not mature besides the profanity that they say cant be helped.) horrible people that'll make you wonder why people talk so highly about it."
s,"Great game If your kid is interested in this kind of game it's a great starting point. There's nothing bloody or graphic, it promotes team play, and it's a very postive game overall, especially compared to others in the genre."
a,"no monitoring at all it is a common problem that really good players create fake accounts as low level players and then enter the game and demolish beginners.
also behavior on online chat is shocking. they need better monitoring without a doubt."
s,Devs don't care at all The developers at blizzard did a fine job advertising and selling this game but now they are not adding anything new so far. This is an amazing game but they need to add something new.
s,"Great online shooter Overwatch is a once in a lifetime online game. It's cutesy and fun gameplay make for a fun time with family, and though there is cartoon violence, there is no blood whatsoever but when your child is playing online you have to watch out for the open chat ( swearing). Otherwise, it is perfect for tweens and up and I would definitely recommend getting this for your child."
s,This game is great! This game is perfect for 9 and up. I let my son play it all the time. No bloody violence but the game is violent. A profanity but it is in Japanese (d*mn). Some smoking but dat's it.
s,installing the game is the best part. All downhill from there. Play literally any other game instead.
s,"Bad The game is not worth the money or time that people put into it. With every single update that is released it just gets worse and honestly the game is dead, it is also full of toxic players, so I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to have a positive experience."
a,"It's hands down the worse game ever. How do you say matchmaking is great when I'm getting into bronze games with diamond not to mention they can't stop nefting /buffing people is so annoying to see that your main does less damage every day or the dps heros lazer you if you don't have a shield, they also neft the shields so killing enemies is 10x harder now don't brother playing a game that your only gonna play for 2 days then quit because the amount of low level booster that keep on killing you tea baging etc also the fans are toxic as hell so good luck finding a player who doesn't say the n word of f word every 5 seconds. horrible gift won't not recommended"
s,"Good game There is lots of violence... but I think that any kid 9 and up can understand that all the violence is fake. You can talk with people online, but it's easy to disable that."
s,You can't live without playing Overwatch and Paladins Great game. i play Overwatch on PS4 and I play a similar free game called Paladins on Switch. Both these games don't have much violence or blood whatsoever. I think the violence rating on both of these games is the fact that you shoot other players online. Nothing is wrong with these game and I think they can get away with an E10+ rating.
a,"Funny and engaging game I never expected my 6 and 9 y.o. daughters to get so engaged in Quake alike 3D first person shooter, but they are doing great. Even my 3 y.o. seem to enjoy practice range and some basic controls, like W, S and mouse.
Anyway, technically violence is very mild, there is no blood and gore, the game is bright and engaging. However, typical Quake concept of running around shooting people and respawning (i.e. reversibility of death) could be a little bit disturbing. They do seem to understand the concept of pretend violence in the form of cyber-sport and they are OK with that.
Both of them have tried M rated shooters, like DOOM and Dead Space 2/3 and they don't like them at all, mostly because of setting, visuals and the form of enemies, even though they are technically capable of playing them.
Back to Overwatch. I would rate the game as 6+, with some form of parental guidance, but only in Practice vs A.I, Arcade and Quick Play modes, without microphone and with chat disabled in settings.
Competitive mode is for 16+ only. Folks are getting really upset there. Swearing and insults are commonplace and, you know, online conversations are not rated by ESRB."
s,"CSM Back At It Again With The Too Old Ratings Here is the motto of Common Sense Media.
""If the game is teen it must be rated by us 13 or higher""
But come on this is Overwatch.
Overwatch has no profanity, sex, or drugs.
I don't count a cowboy smoking tobbaco drugs. He isn't smoking a blunt.
I don't count a mildly provocative character as sex. Bare nudity? No. Full Nudity? No. Sex Scenes? No! Sex is at a 0.
Of course there is violence in a fighting game! But the blood is about as equal to the Skylanders series which is at a 5 for commercialism because having all characters will cost a whopping 3000 dollars (around). However this game got a 4 rating which is one measly less.
All you buy in this game is cosmetics not freaking characters like SkyScammers and BattleBorn The Leach. CMS states the game has lots of merchandise like t-shirts and toys. Every game does. But not everygame has a level 4 on commercialism!
Characters getting dismembered? Why is this in the age review!!! The training robots and one robotic character will fall apart upon death with no blood! Just like in SkyScammers.
Honestly an 8 year old can play this game without it tainting their mind but they'll never get the chance when parents see the number 13 up there. Take it from me. This is fine for the average eight year old!
There are also pretty good messages and role models with a very nice moral background which communicates the goods and bads of wars as well as multiple viewpoints too not only educate but immerse their viewers in a realistic world that is unrealistic. LOL!
It's very easy to play the game. Characters take seconds to learn but hours to master just like a good fighting game should do. Button mashing will get you nowhere but good reflexes, playstyle, and strategy will!
The game is a blast and CMS is famous for not allowing great games to be played by younger audiences when they should be!"
s,"Attention to parents who won't let their child get the game. This is the most kid friendly FPS I've ever played. There is no sexual content or swearing. The violence is NOTHING compared to a 12+ movie and I think a 10 year old of average maturity should be fine with this game. There is virtually no blood and if parents are concerned about the shooting, you are playing as the good guy fighting the bad guy and it doesn't look very realistic. Also most of the time you are fighting against cartoony robots not real people. The game is actually very cartoony and doesn't look real at all. The game also helps with your child's team building skills and reaction times. If your child is over 10 or 11 parents should have nothing to worry about, it's NOWHERE near as violent as most 12+ movies and overall a kid-teen friendly game, so this is a great gift for ages 10 and over."
s,"Here goes CSM horrible rating Okay, before we start, I have been playing OverWatch since launch. I currently sit in the diamond rank which people believe to be the most toxic. Yes, there is a bad egg or two, but there is no reason that this game should be given a rating like CSM did. The game includes many things to get rid of them. The game allows you to avoid people, so you don’t end up in their voice chat and there is the option of leaving a voice channel and muting them. The game includes no drugs, unless you think a cowboy with a cigar is worthy of a drug rating. He’s also smoking a normal cigar, not weed or crack. No sex in the game, to be honest nothing bad at all. Would highly recommend"
s,"Perhaps the most kid-friendly FPS out there While there are ever-so-slightly less violent FPS that have managed to get an E/E10+ rating, I would consider Overwatch the more kid-friendly game. As Common Sense Media mentioned in their review, Overwatch has unique good messages to it, such as that morality is not always black or write, how to overcome obstacles and work with others. The violence is relatively mild, even when compared to other T-rated shooters. For example, Halo 5 had a bit more realism to it, and the blood splatter was on-screen for longer. In Overwatch, blood is infrequent, and the whole game has an abstract style to it separating it easily from reality."
a,"Fun Game but toxic online community This game is really fun and not very inappropriate ... UNTIL you turn on voice chat, people are either extremely toxic(mean) or say stupid stuff. Some of the outfits are slightly revealing but who cares, it's not that bad. There also isn't a lot of blood and for some reason some of the time the characters yell out ""d*mn"" but not very frequently.
**Avoid competitive if you play on PC because the ranking system is really bad and even if you are really good you'll stay in Gold or below unless you are a pro. It's just toxic and rage inducing, no one should have to go through it kid or adult, just stick to arcade and quick play unless you are a pro***"
s,"Another CMS over rating. Listen, listen. As a video game connoisseur i think I have the right to speak on the matter on this game.
Children are gullible, I know, I shouldn’t be saying it. But the fact of the matter is this is the most family friendly shooter game ever made. I got this game at the age of ten, and I will never forget some of the incredibly nice people on this game. Sure, there are some “toxic” gamers who play Overwatch, however, they are generally nice once you calm them down and get to know them.
There is 2 bits of profanity from the characters, however it is hardly noticeable even if you have good ears.
Team building is key in this game. If anyone says different I suggest they actually play the game and see for themselves. Communicating with other teammates about “not pressing” or “staying back” is litterally the basis of the entire game.
A child with the maturity of a goldfish could play this game. This game is the best shooter game if you don’t want your children to have the more violent, grotesque games like COD or Battlefield."
a,"No Drugs Or Sex There is no sex or drugs in it other than the cigar used by one of the characters. This game focuses on strategy rather than violence and teaches kids a lot about tactics. There is no point to not get this game for your children. Great game! I think kids 8 and under cannot handle the online interactions although, and thus I rate it 9 and up!"
s,This Game is made for kids! and teens but id say both 8+ and also common sense doesn't say that it says bad words it says the damn and hell so enjoy this game so awesome!! great game for your kids
s,"CMS know how to over exaggerate The common sense media review is completely ridiculous. There is 0 sex AT ALL. There are 0 drugs AT ALL. The closest you can get to a drug is a cowboy smoking a cigar, but what do you expect? PG tv shows have people smoking cigars soo what's the problem? Very little blood, guns are cooler than they are dangerous. Dismemberment of a character? There's a robot character when he dies spring and screws go everywhere... When a character explodes, it's body just turns to a rag doll. I hate the poor kids that are told no over getting this game because CSM said its 13+ and gave false info."
s,"Great game, Least Violent FPS Game I've ever played. Overwatch is an excellent game and definently one of my favorites. It's nothing like any other FPS game I've ever played. I would personally say that this should be rated E10+ rather than T. For some reason, CMS says that character dismememberment is in this game, when a character dies there is NO dismemberment (except for the ROBOTIC character, Bastion). Also, over half of the roster doesn't have guns (not counting laser guns as a gun). There is extremely little blood that is rarely seen. This game also isn't like a normal FPS game that's extremely dark. The overall vibe of the game is about heroism. And the graphics are in an animated Pixar style. This game has no sex, and no drugs or alcohol. One character smokes a cigar, though. I would highly recommend this game to any family with children 10 or over."
s,Amazing for 10+ 
s,Best Game Ever 
s,"A battleground full of character!!! First of, lets get something out the way, by no means is this game stereotypical or sexist. Yes, some women have revealing outfits, but the same could be said for some of the men. You could say the characters use ""drugs"" to heal themselves which even saying that is over exaggerating. And literally there is no blood or gore just a few bullets so the violence is low to a mature standard. Now the ACTUAL game, its excellent. While sometimes it gets a little bit repetetive, the character and feel-good vibe with the bright map design could keep you addicted for hours. Also, teamwork and skill is a LARGE part of this game so young children might learn a thing or two. Over all, Its brilliant. Go out and buy it RIGHT NOW."
s,"Very solid game Overwatch is a very solid game, really fun and easy to play. It is an FPS with guns but there isn't any blood and the guns look really futuristic and more cool than violent. Nothing wrong with this game at all. As long as you know how to play as a team and with good strategy this is great."
s,AMAZING TWAS AMAZING
s,more kid friendly call of duty this game is like call of duty but more kid friendly but no story mode only online play with small blood cartoon violence and very little smoking
s,"Good game, don't buy. Overwatch is a good game with great gameplay, that has its own charm, but don't buy it at all. By buying this game you are supporting Activision Blizzard, who are the worst company in existence. Also the game has lootboxes."
s,Good game to play with friends This is a good shooter game. I got the most enjoyment out of this game while playing with my best friend. This game has a bit of blood but nothing bad. The built in voice chat system may expose you to swearing but no profanity in dialogue. Good game 8/10
s,"A fun shooter game. This game is a fun shooter game but I really don’t play it anymore but it’s a fun shooter. The game has lots of original characters that you can play as, lots of nice maps and lots of stuff you can do! However, the game can be a little toxic and the characters sometimes say Damn it but it isn’t that major"
s,"The. Best. Franchise. Ever. Ace Attorney has long been my favorite franchise and I can say with certainty that this game does NOT disappoint. This game is a thrilling addition to the AA series and a must for fans. Nahyuta Sahdmadhi, one of the newer characters, is in my own opinion, the best in the entire series. Many other new characters are completely exclusive to the game, while characters from previous games also make appearances. Fans, and people who are new to the series, will have an easy time picking up most of how the game works, although I would suggest in all caps for skip readers:
DO NOT SKIP TO THIS GAME, OR BEGIN WITH IT, if you care at all about a lot of the backstory. There are many characters and references, along with, obviously, spoilers to the five previous games. If you choose to play the games chronologically from beginning to SOJ, play them in this order: Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Justice For All, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations, Apollo Justice Ace Attorney, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Dual Destinies, and Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Spirit of Justice.
Have fun and : OBJECTION!"
a,"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice review. This is the last game in the Ace Attorney series for now to be localised.
It expands the character of Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes from the last game, Dual Destinies. It has one of the best soundtracks in the series.
About the 13 and up rating: The game IS a murder mystery (like all other games in the franchise) and does contain blood and death.
TL;DR: Latest localised game in the franchise, one of the best soundtracks. Blood and death."
s,"Update for 2019: This is not the current version of the game I just wanted to clarify for parents, that this version of World of Warcraft was the Legion expansion that was released in 2016. WoW in 2019 is a very different game, and if you want current reviews... you should look under World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth. I started playing WoW in 2007, and would currently NOT recommend it. See my review in Battle for Azeroth."
s,"Fun for the family When it comes to MMOs you can't go wrong with WoW, with age it's only gotten more casual friendly as well, less time needed to progress, certain character classes are much easier for younger children to play and plenty to do outside of the typical end game features expected from MMOs."
s,"Very good Game! Very fun third person, open world game! Fun quest's, dungeons, and pvp. You get to make your own character and choose your faction and professions! It can be very complex and complicated, therefor, it is geared toward older mature kids."
s,I love WoW It's a very fun game and I play it with my friend. The scenery is beautiful. The quests are fun. My only complaint about Legion is that once you reach lvl 110 it's just ENDLESS GRINDING until you get your class mount and stuff. The new raids are amazing.
s,Great game This is a really great game to play. The graphics are great comparing this made in 2016. The controls are a bit hard to catch in the beginning but step by step it will be easier. One of the best basketball games ever!!
s,Play it The playing concept is ok little swearing and great role models The privacy and safety is exceptional and it is SO easy to play
s,I quit COD for months This game was the best thing i have ever played on xbox.
s,"One of the best video games of all time. We got the switch for Christmas and my mother got my son Zelda, Breath of the Wild. This is a game we play together and offers me great teaching opportunities. For the more difficult parts I’ll play(bosses mostly) The puzzles are amazing and allow me to teach my son cooperative problem solving. The graphics and music are absolutely beautiful. The world is huge, completely open ended and you aren’t required to play the game in any particular order. There is mild violence but no blood and gore. To be honest my 6 year old sees more graphic violence watching and playing football than playing this game. Just be forwarned it is quite difficult in some parts and if you aren’t planning to help your child play it it’s probably not appropriate for kids 8 and under."
s,"The game play is for older kids, but my son played it with his dad and loved it I actually really enjoyed watching my husband and 8 year old play this together. It's so beautiful and interesting. The side quests are fun and the game play lasts a LOOOOONG time. They will be working on it for a long time, making it worth the money. It really is a fantastic game. I think if my 8 year old played it by himself, it would have been to hard for him though. Good for a family of gamers."
s,"Nothing in it. Great messages and role models, easy to learn, only mild violence , no blood or gore at all."
a,"Easy to pick up and fun, but with minor glaring ""problems"" later on. Unnecessary suggestive 'content'. The excitement of having an ""open world"" Zelda game is enough to make someone dive right in and spend hours getting the main character,Link, equipped and battle ready after waking from his slumber. Some flaws do hinder the experience, but overall the camera, the enemy target locking system and the slow motion dodge mechanics all work very well and minimize frustration with minimal ""unfair "" deaths. This allows the player to earn his victories fairly and smoothly with a very cooperative and even battle system. Although the Nintendo Switch as a console is quite underpowered compared to it's peers, the cartooish graphics of Zelda still look great and the attention to detail in all these other areas more than compensate for the gritty detail of many games of it's kind to the point that you don't even notice or care, especially after you get into the adventure early on. The only glaring flaw between the Switch and Wii U version is the occassional ""hiccup"" in battles on the Switch version which can cause a frame rate drop in certain areas. Once you experince this, however, you know where these rare spots are and can avoid repeat occasions.
After you experiment and pull off the more intimidating moves you realize that they are actually less diffuicult than they 'look' on the screen, making a very satisfying payoff when you pull off these 'tricks' and are able to chain moves together. Very often you run into powerful enemies that can 'bake your cookies' very quickly, but you always have the option of approaching from multiple directions with different approaches in your arsenal. You can tackle these encounter in several different ways making each encounter as unique as you like. With many powers at your disposal later on you discover that experimentation and toying with these abilities are perhaps even more fun than the encounters themselves.
The few drawbacks I took into consideration were these: Weapons break, ALOT, which is odd that a ""realistic"" mechanic like this was implemented in a game of this nature because you can still carry a truckload of weapons for no reason at all, but they all break like they were made at a toy factory and are far too brittle. this causes you to use different weapons and juggle inventory, but when a weapon breaks mid battle, which is all the time, you are left scrambling to scrounge another weapon from inventory. Although you can pause mid battle to do this, it is especially annoying in major fights and really takes away from the continuity and flow of battle.
The enemies can get repetitive. There are basically 2 organic races and 'sentinel' robots you will be battling with some exceptions and winged nuisances, but you will be essentially dispatching these same enemies throughout. The bosses break this up and are interesting encounters with a memorable battle sequence and puzzle to solve but the tedium of these familiar battles sets in after awhile.You will spend most of your time traversing a very large space of land to find 'shrines' in order to solve a dungeon puzzle or challenge with mini sentinals. There is variety here, but noticeably not enough for a sandbox game of this size.
Cooking....you will be doing hours of this if you want to survive the harshest battles. You can experiment with this as well and it is a unique feature that is very interesting at first. You can't save recipes though so once you find something effective you need a pen and paper to keep your found recipe for later. This however , can also require large chunks of time and become borish after your experimentation early on.
You can tame and ride horses, stable multiple steeds, use a glider for traversing high to low areas of any height. Between the shrines you can climb towers which open your maps and give you even more challenges and exploration. There are even hidden challenges along the way and side quests. The only real downside is these are all acheived with these same drawbacks mentioned before, which may be a deal breaker for some, especially after getting deep into the game.
On a final Added note to parents, there are fountain fairies that are oversexulized in the game which may cause some concern. There is no nudity, but these giant women are 'well endowed' in a very obvious and purposeful way. The dialogue is not overt but hints at flirtation at times, and along with some awkward 'swooning' noises, may be inappropriate for younger players. In an otherwise family conscious action title, it's awkward and out of place in an otherwise tame themed game."
s,"Amazing game, not inappropriate at all but has a ton a tricky puzzles This game is very fun and all ages should play it, and don't tell any kid over 6 no to this game, unless you don't like the price. But the game will be very challenging because of all the puzzles, I really needed to help my kids with this one. But if your kids have ever played uncharted they will be fine. The uncharted games were way more inappropriate and just a little harder. So if you leta young kid get this game, help them out."
s,The Best Game Nintendo Has To Offer A little difficult for younger kids. Overall a great game. Nintendo really outdid themselves with this game. I highly recommend it to everyone!
s,"Not for little kids, but 10 and over is definitely fine. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a high fantasy adventure game where the hero Link explores and survives the wilderness of the lost kingdom of Hyrule.
True to their family-oriented style, this Nintendo game does not indulge in violence, gore, sex, profanity or drug use.
BotW features fantasy violence, with weapons like swords being used against fictional monsters. No blood or damage is ever shown. Deaths are quick, with monsters turning to black and disappearing in a puff of smoke. The bosses ""bleed"" a substance known as Malice, which is more of a physical manifestation of hatred and it is made clear that they are not living creatures like the rest of us.
Some characters make a flirtatious ""hmm"" or giggle to Link, but nothing you wouldn't find in a PG film.
Very minor alcohol use is suggested in one location. While never directly called alcohol, Link is told he is ""too young"" for the drink and can never obtain it.
No profanity.
Some scenes may be scary to very young children, which is why this game is given a 12 (or equivalent) rating all around the world."
s,"PLEASE STOP AND READ MY REVIEW This game is amazing! The art style is beautiful, and the endless possibilities are a nice touch. In this adventure, Link goes on a quest to save Hyrule from an awaking evil. On the way, you'll encounter enemies that Link can battle, puzzles to solve, and over 100+ side quests.
There is NO blood or gore, instead, the enemies disappear into a puff of smoke. All the characters (specifically women) are dressed modestly. There is no profanity or sex either. There is a reference to alcohol though, as there is a lady who runs a shop in the game who sells drinks that ""are definitely just for adults"". Thankfully Link can never obtain these drinks for himself. In addition, there is a character within the game that says ""heck"".
Overall I'd say this game is great for kids 9+ and will provide endless amounts of fun for kids looking for an ever expanding and amazing adventure."
s,One of the Best Video Game for adult and kid 
s,"The Best of what Nintendo has to offer! First off, if there are any families out there concerned with fantasy elements within media, I suggest you go and read J.R.R. Tolkien's essay on fairy tales.
Great Messages/Role Models - Link is a self sacrificing hero through and through. In the story he has already given his life in a way for the safety of his people. The game starts with Link waking up in something called The Shrine of Resurrection (Note that link did not actually die, but was severely wounded and needed to recover in this sort of stasis healing pod). Link wakes up 100 years after Gannon (the main bad guy) attacked the kingdom. Link failed to stop him and was gravely wounded. Zelda then managed to ""seal"" Gannon in the castle. While Link was recuperating, Zelda has been fighting Gannon in the castle for 100 years (presumable kept young by some magic used).
There is violence in this game. Link faces off agains monsters of all sorts. The message here is best stated by G.K. Chesterton: ""Fairytales don’t tell children that dragons exist. Children already know that dragons exist. Fairytales tell children that dragons can be killed."" Younger children might need to be guided by a parent to this meaning, but older children may find a role model in the character of Link. He stands up for what is right and seeks to destroy evil in his world even though the odds are against him.
Easy to Play/use: This is the hardest Zelda game to date. Definitely not for younger kids. That being said 10 year olds should find this game challenging but doable. Learning enemy patterns and combat is difficult at first, but will eventually be mastered. There are 120 ""shrines"" that present easy-difficult puzzles using the games incredible physics and environment engine. There are multiple ways to solve puzzles throughout the game which promotes creativity in all areas of play.
Consumerism - In this game you do collect a lot of items, but the majority of them are earned or found rather than simply purchased. An underlying theme of the game is exploration. The map is vast and any player will want to explore every single mountain top and valley just to see what's there. The currency of the game does play a big role in acquiring some items, but it is not the focal point of the game.
Drinking/drugs/smoking - There is one area where there is a bar and they tell you that you can't have any of their drinks because you are under age. In the bar there is one character who is passed out. This is a side quest that does not need to be completed and would most likely go over the heads of most children.
Swearing - No foul language at all
Sex - There are a few things to mention here. Firstly, in the game there are 4 great fairy fountains that player can locate. The fairies huge and dressed extravagantly with tons of make up and glitter. Like a form fitting sparkly bathing suit. They have large breasts but the game doesn't focus on them. They make comments on how Link is handsome and when they upgrade his gear (that is their function) they blow kisses, hug, kiss Link in a way that is to be seen as comical. They are not a huge part of the game, and you can literally play for hours and hours without encountering one.
Secondly, in the South Western part of the map, there is a race called the Gerudo. They are a race of tall, muscular women. (Think Amazon type). Tall (almost twice as tall as Link), dark skin (some are lighter). There are older, younger, and children Gerudu, and there are different body types as well (some are huskier and more heavy set, I give some props for Nintendo for including this). However, the majority of them are tall, slim and muscular. They wear baggy pants with an exposed belly and bra top. One of them is a Champion that Link knew in the past and is in a few cut scenes (but not in a sexual way, aside from here costume). A small detail that most won't notice is that all the Gerudo wear slightly elevated heels. A detail I wish wasn't in the game as heels are sometimes seen as ""sexy."" There is no love interest with any of these characters, but Link does need to disguise himself as a girl to gain access to their town because they don't allow men in. Again, this cross dressing is meant to be comical and makes no attempt to push agendas that are outside of gaming. The Gerudo are warriors and definitely do not take the whole ""damsel in distress"" role. Two of the champions that Link fights beside are female, so there are strong female characters present (more on that in a moment). Aside from the Gerudo and the Great Fairies all other female characters are dressed modestly.
A Damsel in Distress - One of the critiques of this game is that it promotes that men must always save women and that women need to be rescued. The main story of all the Zelda games is in fact that Link needs to save Zelda from Gannon. But more modern Zelda games put a different twist on it (In Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Zelda actually disguises herself as a ninja type character to fight alongside and aid Link). In Breath of the Wild, Zelda is indeed in need of rescuing, but only because Link failed to protect her the first time they encountered Gannon, and she has been fighting Gannon on her own for the past 100 years while you recovered in the stasis healing pod. Part of the story is that Zelda has struggled to find the her purpose and power necessary to overcome the evil in the world. Only after Link fails to protect her, does the power become realized within her, and she uses that power to save Link from death at the hands of a monster. At first glance you could see only ""man saving woman"" but a closer look at the story shows that there is more going on. Two of the champions are female and were chosen to be champions because of their capability and skill in planning and battle.
Themes in Zelda: In most Zelda games the relic called the Triforce plays a major role. In Breath of the Wild, it is curiously absent save for veiled references. The Triforce is represented by three golden triangles each representing the virtues of Power, Wisdom, and Courage. These virtues were created by the Goddess Hylia (the supreme God of the Zelda universe) and represented by three lesser spirits or dragons depending on the game. In each game Link always possess the Triforce of courage, Zelda has the Triforce of wisdom, and Gannon (the bad guy), the Triforce of power. Gannon seeks control of all three so he can conquer the world. How he originally got the triforce of power remains unknown, but it can be used to teach children that power itself isn't evil, but if you have wisdom and courage alongside it, power can be a power for the forces of good in the world.
In Breath of the Wild, Gannon is depicted as a monster (in earlier games he was a Gerudo man but that's another discussion). The game states that in his lust for power he lost all resemblance to humanity and became an embodiment of Evil. There is no pity for this character in Breath of the Wild, only a driving need to defeat evil and rebuild the world it destroyed.
I hope this article helps you decide if this game is worth letting your kids play. This game is truly a masterpiece!"
a,"Great Fairy Rape Scene I'm very surprised no one has mentioned this so far. Granted, it's not the easiest to unlock, but it's been 4 years, so I would've thought someone would mention it by now. People have mentioned that the great fairy characters are oversexualized, which is true. What I haven't seen mentioned on here is what happens when you finishing unlocking all four of the great fairies. This takes quite a few hours to do, and it won't happen unless you go out of your way to do it, but doing so allows you to greatly power up your character's armor, so there is a large incentive to do it in-game.
The problem is, the final cutscene of you upgrading your armor very clearly has the oversexualized giant woman (""great fairy"") character grabbing the human-sized teenage male protagonist and dragging him underwater into her flower den thing for very clearly implied rape (the protagonist yells, reappears passed out facedown on the ground with the great fairy fixing her hair, the upgrades leading up to it get progressively sexual, etc.). I mean, sure, you don't TECHNICALLY see the forced sex happen, but for all but the smallest kids, it'll be very clear what happens.
Further, the upgrade prior to this has her kissing him against his will, so it's also decently implied that this last cutscene is non-consensual. Since this is a role-playing game, this can make the player feel violated, as well. Definitely something parents/kids should be aware of so the kids aren't caught off-guard.
Other than that though, the game is absolutely amazing. Just really bothered me that this hasn't been mentioned in the majority of reviews."
s,"Breath of the Wild review Breath of the Wild
I love Breath of the Wild, it is amazing! It is a very open world game which makes it amazing, you can do literally WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO!!!! I love fighting all of the monsters, but my favorite is the lynel and guardians. A lynel is basically a centaur with a lion mane and horns.
A guardian is a robot that shoots lasers at you!!!
One of the most important items in the game are weapons. You need weapons to attack monsters. My favorite weapon is the Ancient Bladesaw.
Bows are also a helpful weapon. My favorite bows are the Savage Lynel bow and the Ancient bow.
Armor gives you defense and sometimes a power for example Zora armor lets you swim up waterfalls when you wear it. My favorite armor set is Ancient armor.
Another thing that is great about this game is horses. You can ride them only if you can catch one!!! I have a giant horse named Pumpkin (it is black with tiger orange mane) when you ride a horse you can twirl a spear you are holding.
Dishes are great for recovering hearts and stamina instantly, and certain dishes can give you buffs ( A buff is a positive effect.) such as cold resistance. A great dish is made with 5 hearty durians and that gives you full heart recovery and 20 extra hearts!
I love this game so much I fell for an April Fools Day prank on YouTube. I found all 3 dragons in the world and got a shard of each of their teeth and a giant ancient core to make an ancient key so I could “ride in a Guardian” and I found out that it was not real. &gt;:(
Overall this game is amazing. I highly suggest Breath of the Wild!!! ;)"
a,pretty sure that it was this game. I was watching a Legend of Zelda play through. Now I've been wanting this game for a while but the video made me take it down to four stars instead of five I'll get back to why it is four stars instead of five. The reason I don't have that game is because I don't have any of those consoles. I do have a commodore 64 so maybe I can just get one of the earlier zelda games on that. Anyways going back on topic the thing that ruined some of it is the oversexualization of the great fairies. they even show a close up view. The reason I didn't write an age recommendation is because some people think it is for three years some people think it is for ten years so I didn't want to offend and or create any tension about this subject. And the only reason why I said 13+ is because it made my post an age in order for me to post my review last time I was on this website it didn't say that I had to post a review. so what i'm trying to say is since when was the age reccomendation highly enforced
s,"Perfect for kids! As a mother with an 8-year-old son, I appreciate the lack of violence in the game. The great fairies mentioned are not sexualized at all, they are simply fairies who upgrade links armor. There is no romance or sexuality which I think is good, as I bought this game for my 8 yr old. I supervise him while playing, and the foraging aspect of the game made him ask me to go to the park so he could ""build a fort"" and ""make a master sword."" there is no cursing in the game, and I've found that it had a positive effect on my child. I definitely recommend it."
s,your kidding right? this is ok for all ages. maybe a scary monster.
s,"best zelda game violence with no blood, in addition to some very minor sexual references. also some good puzzles.
violence 4/10
sex 1/10
language 0/10
educational value 6/10
also, cam phrases things in a way that makes it sound as if everyone matures at the same rate, which is wrong. don’t listen to that, as that is just a (sometimes inaccurate) estimation"
s,"Adventurous Whoever rated this an 18 is so so wrong, this game is not intend to use sexual content and whats wrong with defeating bad guys, it really lets you adventure with NO blood WHAT SO EVER."
s,"The Best Game Ever I am a HUGE fan of the Legend Of Zelda series but BOtW has to be my favorite it is such a great game and it is even better than my personal favorite Majoras Mask. First the violence isnt that bad, most enemys will when you kill them they blow up in a cloud of smoke also if you think that some enimies ooze blood they actually are oozing a substance called mailce also those of you that say the faries are over sexualised is because they are supposed to be sexy and have big tits also there is great role models and its easy to play and for those of you that think tits is a bad word who cares"
s,"A really fun game for the family I put my age rating at 9, but my 7 year old step daughter plays this game and enjoys it. Without help from us though she would struggle a lot in some places. She gets frustrated because even though I’m farther than her in the game, there’s still so many questions she has that I just don’t know the answers to. If you can handle that sort of frustration in your kids, I’d say even younger than 9 would most likely be okay to play it, but totally depends on the individual kid. I did find one curse word in the game, but I think it’s not a common dialogue to find, as it requires you leaving the Divine Beast Medoh in the middle of it and speaking with Tebo. It’s nothing too explicit with it only being the word “dammit”, but worth noting anyways."
s,"Extremely addictive, extremely rewarding This may be the best game I've ever played, but it is VERY difficult. It mixes combat with puzzles, and a nice hybrid of realistic and cartoon graphics. The full game itself can take up to 150 hours, excluding the DLCs. The DLCs are also great, but are a grain of sand compared to the actual game. There is so much to do and explore. The only two flaws are the many glitches and cheats. Oh, and also, I forgot to mention, it would great if you could add a multiplayer mode, Nintendo! There is no blood and gore except for otherworldly fluids spurting out of bosses, which are monsters. I guess the Ganons could be scary to younger gamers."
s,"The Great Fairies aren't over-sexualized, it's just hard to find giant clothes. I've seen a lot of concerns about the Great Fairies and the violence. I'm a huge Zelda fan. In fact, I've got Oracle of Seasons and Minish Cap mangas on the couch next to me.
First of all, the Great Fairies are beings that can enhance Link's armor. If you give them some rupees (Legend of Zelda currency, small gems, Great Fairies use rupees for energy) they can upgrade, say, the vest that helps Link scale cliffs and bluffs. While the fairies wear clothes of soft flowers and leaves, they aren't sexualized, they just... Wear flowers and leaves for clothes. However, I guess it would be hard to find giant clothes at the Kakariko clothes shop. Really, all of the clothes are Link-sized for gamer convenience.
Also, the violence in the game isn't worse than any violence you can find playing in or watching any sports game. Any small mobiles that are killed disappear in a puff of eerie purple and red smoke. Useful items such as horns or fangs that can be used are dropped and can be picked up for future use."

s,"The BEST Video Game on the Planet I, myself, think this video game is the best I've ever played. The free world offers lots of potential, and players don't even have to follow the main quest! The puzzles are probably easier than the ones in any other Zelda game, and the potential is unlimited!"
s,"good game, alot of violence its a awesome game, but it has a lot of violence, games that are mostly for kids like super mario 3d all stars or pokemon sword have all most the same violence that the legend of zelda, but they are rated E and the legend of zelda is rated E +10, I think if there was a rating 8+, they'll put it. There is no blood."
s,"One of the best games I have ever played I started playing this game when I was about 10 and I LOVED it. I remember being super proud of myself whenever I would complete a super tricky puzzle or defeat a hard enemy. Now I am 13 and I am STILL playing this wonderful game that I think everyone can enjoy. As a little side note, some of the puzzles in this game are very hard that even I can't solve, and I know that when my 6 year old sister watches me and my brother play she sometimes has to walk out of the room when we get into boss fights or just fights in general. Your kid might not be like that, but just keep in mind that some of the content can be scary. Also there is one person in the game that has beer bottles strewn on the floor, and talks drunkly, but my brother didn't notice until I pointed it out to him. ( he is 9 by the way)"
s,A good game for kids I think it is fun
s,"I have been gaming since I was 4 at the maximum, and BOTW is the best game I have ever played in that time. BOTW is the greatest game I have ever played. The game does have some flaws which I won't deny, like the story just being kinda there, but this game is still excellent. The game is made by Nintendo so there is no sexual content or language, just a bit of violence but no blood. The open world is so vast and gives you freedom to do tons of things, like fight the final boss right after you finish the tutorial. I would give this game 6 stars if I could."
s,My brothers love it 
s,"The Best I've seen a lot of complaining about the Great Fairies, but they aren't being sexual on purpose. If you're that big, it's going to be hard to find clothes. And the violence is about as violent as a Soccer game. Monsters aren't horrifying, if anything, they are actually kind of goofy. When you kill them there isn't blood, just a poof of purple smoke, which is cool. When the Blight Ganons die, there is a bit of purple goo that shoots out of them but it is the same color as them, so you can hardly tell. It's called Malice, so it's not blood. The shrines and Divine Beasts can be hard but it is so worth it to get those extra hearts or Divine Powers. The clothes are so cool, especially since you can dye them. And they all fit Link perfectly. And best of all, the game looks AMAZING. It almost looks real and you can interact with almost anything. Some stuff can't be climbed or cut (like shrines can't be cut) but stuff like trees can. One of my favorite games ever."
s,"best game ever so the game has only been out for 14 days and has already landed on number 4 of metacritics best games of all time. now back to the review the game doesnt have any blood or killing of humans but the game is FILLED with monsters and animals to kill you have to kill animals to obtain hearts and it is recommended to kill onsters so that you can get better weapons these monsters look like goblins. if you hit them small explosion like animations play. The game has no consume of alcohol or drugs but you can cook elixirs which give you effects such as cold resistant , heat resistant or health. But on a positive note this game is filled with riddle everywhere for example lets say you find a circle of stones but theres a stone missing so you take a stone from somewhere else and put in the circle and then something happens that is very helpful to you. And you find details like this everywhere in this HUGE world."
s,"Its truly one of the best Zelda games I have played the whole game, the violence in this Zelda is not bad, its has got a lot worse in other games. If your talking in terms of violence it would be 4+, but some of the shrines and divine beasts can be very difficult in terms of puzzles. So, if you want to beat the game without out looking up certain shrines on youtube, i would say 8+."
s,READ READ READ NOW This is the greatest game of all time. If anybody rates lower than 4 stars then they are dumb and have no taste in video games. Very long to beat making it worth the money you payed. No swearing and NO DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. Csm is false for drugs. Play this game and you won't regret.
s,Amazing game! This game is the best
s,"Great for all ages My family from 8 year old siblings to my 65 year old grandparents enjoy it. Amazing gameplay, so much to do!"
s,"Great game for ALL ages to play This game was my introduction to the Legend of Zelda series, and all I can say is wow! This is such a great game with a rich and detailed storyline, fun side quests, and awesome things to collet. You can solve puzzles and travel the huge map without getting bored once! I’ve spent probably 150+ hours in this game, and I can say that there are absolutely no cons. There is fantasy violence, but no blood or gore whatsoever. All you do is smash monsters in the face with medieval weapons, so it’s not bad at all. I would say that there is some pretty good vocabulary, so get ready to explain some words to your kids. Overall, amazing game, 1000.2% full-heartedly recommend."
s,"expensive but worth it masterpiece this game has a lot of action and a lot of unrealistic fantasy violence, some slightly sugestive scenes including some fairy only wearing leaves on their brests,and one romantic scene, and one swearword (D*mn) this is great for smart kids who like minecraft and like zelda and other open world games. what makes makes it hard though, are its puzzles witch makes a great challenge(although I just look at youtube videos!) but nothing that a nine year old cant handle!"
s,Great Storyline is hard to understand a bit and also there IS A BIT OF ‘SEXY STUFF SHOWN’ but not to much to worry more like half a dot just a bit of flirting
s,"Awesome. I love the game. I still have much tricks to do, and it just never ends. At this point, I'm in Master Mode, and those pesky Guardians are a lot more challenging then in Normal Mode (yay!). Lot's of great and awesome mods that will DEFINITELY BRING SOME CHALLENGE (Example: Relics of the Past) to some that don't make sense at all.
No blood, mild violence, and 100% AWESOME!
(except the final trials in master mode)"
s,NOT VIOLENT it has blood but it is all just red 8bit particles and it it has no graphic content
a,"its good I enjoy it, its best for a group of four players. Violence and gore is consistent, what you see is mostly what is in the entire game. I will warn that there is actually partial nudity (topless woman), and its only after you unlock a certain character. I point that out because I saw no mention in the current guide."
s,Good Should
s,"perfect for an 11 to 12 y/o kid. there is some violence, but it is only pixels, and there's too much going on to focus on that."
s,"Great local fun I think this game is really fun, I first played it a couple days ago. There is some blood which I agree could have a setting for. It’s a great game over all, maybe not for young viewers, but is great for local fun."
s,"best game its not bloody, 18+ no way"
s,"Amazing Sci_Fi Strategy Game This is an AMAZING strategy game, especially for one made in the 90s!
Inappropriateness
The game does jave some flirting between Jim Raynor and Sarah Kerrigan in one of the terran missions, but it's literally like 10 seconds long. And there is blood whenever a unit dies, plus lots of weapons are used, as well as some swearing. As long as your kid knows not to play with weapons and flirt and swear at a young age, this should be fine.
Scariness
Some of the zerg cinematics can be scary, as well as the little portrait that appears on the bottom right when you click on a hydralisk, but the cinematics dor zerg aren't that important. And there are lots of weapons such as ""Wraiths"", which are like jets with lasers and missile.
Gameplay
The concept of Starcraft and Warcraft is part of what introduced tower defense games like Plants vs. Zombies and Field Runners - The developer of Plants vs. Zombies actually helped work on Warcraft 3. The game has an almost unlimited number of strategies you can use and is almost perfectly balanced. The cool thing is that you can play as 3 different races instead of the terran (humans) all the time. Terean are the human spaceforce with some sci-fi tech. Zerg, the main baddies, are savage aliens trying to destroy planets and evolve their race. Protoss are aliens that have really advanced technology and seek to destroy the zerg swarm. The only three issues I have with gameplay are: 1; You can only select 12 units at a time, which can be a problem for zerg players. 2; This game could be fairly difficult for littles, but is reasonably challenging for pre teens and up. 3; The movement of units can be pretty clumsy. Issues 1 and 3 are fixed in Starcraft 2, by the way."
s,"Played this since I was 4. Great experience Fantastic gem from Blizzard; a blast from the past that still hold up perfectly today many years later. I still play it today, and have done on a regular basis the last 12 years. And since it's now free, it's a must have"
s,"Super awesome less violent! Gigantic is a video game I recently got for free on my Xbox one S. It is extremely fun and it is less violent. This is a game like overwatch, but it is 3rd person and the goal is different. There is said to be blood, I haven't seen any in the midst of the explosions. But CSM went waaaaay over the age rating for this. You play online against other people, but you can easily disable open chat and voice chat. Weapons vary from magic, to swords, to bows, to lasers, to guns. Similar to overwatch, there is a competitive season. I think the controls are easier to use than overwatch. They are bothe great games but overwatch still remains the best!"
s,"A Solid Tale/Adventure for Older Kids and Up, Notable Patience and Sophistication Required Final Fantasy XII, when you fully analyze it, is a sophisticated, artistic and very in-depth game, from its interface to its world-building lore, all the way to the way how many locations are pretty massive. It is, however, a very long-winded game, even in this version that has a speed-up feature - As such, while I could certainly recommend the game for kids 14 and older, I would extend the caveat that the individual, kid or adult, would require an intense mental discipline to see it through.
Some games I refer to as a ""thinking person's game"", but usually these are ones that require a considerable amount of concentration on the task, such as a massive Real-Time Strategy, but Final Fantasy XII is different -- It tells a very long story with many, perhaps too many, secondary characters, and as such keeping track of how everything plays out requires a considerable amount of memory. Think of this as long-term complex thinking, like reading a Tolkien novel, as the number of moving parts that you need to keep track of in the long-term are quite considerable (and many of which are largely irrelevant, one of the few things I would say genuinely against the story the game tells). It also deals with rather adult themes such as how often times tyrants and oppressive rulers will often times operate as a friend of the people, or how attempting to help those around you can have adverse affects, and that not all allies are permanent as your overall objectives might be considerably different, only in-line with each other in the short-term. The game also features a Shakespearian prose for many characters, so one requires a careful ear for any younger gamers.
In terms of the game itself, it has sharp dialogue, some wonderful symphonic music, a fun playstyle, varied landscapes and enemy types, a complex, multi-layered world of differing races and societies, and a solid art style that is unique but doesn't go overly extravagant as some entries like X and XIII. It's a competent Quasi-Action/RPG that requires strategy and long-term concentration in regards to the storytelling, and for this I would recommend it for smart older children, and adults."
s,"Not bad at all! This game is very deep but has nothing inappropriate at all! Yes there is some blood but no gore. There is absolutely no swearing at all. It is very good and does not deserve the M eating it gets. Probably the best RPG I’ve ever played and I highly recommend it! If you are on the fence and think it will be inappropriate just because it has an M rating, you should get it because it is appropriate. 10/10"
a,"Hand up skirt and manipulating her parts. https://www.esrb.org/ratings/35672/Divinity%3A+Original+Sin+2+-+Definiti...
Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition
Rating Summary
-- The game contains some sexual material: the central character can employ the services of a prostitute at a pub—no sexual activity is depicted, though the dialogue/text makes sexual references (e.g., “Your hand slides all the way up until you reach her, and you make a soft circling motion with your thumb”; “Slowly she undresses you then takes you to bed""; ""Your world explodes in bliss.""). The word “sh*t” is heard in dialogue.
Really you 3 adults above would you let your younger teenagers play this game with that in it? One person would let their 9 year old play it?"
a,"If your child asks to play it, I beg of you let them (within reason) Give this review a full read before making your decision. This game has its mature aspects for sure. There IS some mild profanity. There IS ONE single tiny quest that involves suggested sex and is so out of the way and obscurely described that I doubt a young mind would pick up on it. There IS suggestive drinking and drug usage. There IS violence and mild blood.
BUT: This game presents moral choices, problem solving, and general adventure in such a wonderful way. Your choices have genuine impact on others and the world around you. Everything in the game takes planning as rushing into things often ends in failure and unforeseen consequences. If your child already grasps slightly more complex games then this is an excellent seque into a more immersive world."
a,"Not for little kids, but only fantasy violence. Fantasy violence from a distant perspective. Not for little kids, but fine for all teens"
a,"Best RPG I've ever played This is by far the best RPG I've ever played. I've been playing since it first came out in 2017 and I've had nothing but a positive experience.
It has a meaningful storyline, great three dimensional characters, a unique combat system and outstanding graphics. It's an absolutely amazing and well-rounded game.
As for whether your child should play this game, I'd say they should be 13+. While there is violence, it's nothing crazy gory. However, there are several sex scenes that happen depending on what NPCs you choose to have in your party. If you get stuck in a sex scene, there is nothing graphic and it can be easily skipped over.
There are a few suggestive themes, such as prostitution, drug cartels, etc, but it's nothing major and shouldn't be too much of a problem for a kid playing (I got to the prostitution part as a 12 year old and it was fine, albeit a little awkward to play through with my dad).

s,"It’s one of the best games for teens+. My friend encouraged me to buy this game. I was hesitant because of the price, but I gave in and I purchased it. It’s very exciting. You need to make good choices to get good results. If you steal, you get into fights. You have to earn your way to the top, and it’s very enjoyable. Yes, like any other game there is violence. There’s also ale, beer, etc., but it doesn’t encourage you to drink. Rarely any swearing.
A really good RPG!"
s,"Fantastic racing series! I've been a fan of the series since it started over a decade ago! Remember Gran Turismo over 20 years ago? Remember being frustrated at too many tuner cars, Mitsubishis, Toyotas? Forza solved that with a more Western bias. It was like a miracle. There is no problem giving it to your kids here. They will enjoy it to their hearts content."
s,"Forza is not what is use to be I have played forzas all the way from The original Forza Motorsports on the first Xbox all the way to the 7th motorsport.
LETS START WITH THE PROS:
1 Great graphics
2 Full Campaign
3 competitive racing
4 lots of cars
5 competitive multiplayer
CONS
1 AI's racing recognition
2 back to back copy of the last motorsport
3 lobbys are very laggy even with great internet
4 very few after market options (visually)
5 game can freeze now and then
6 less courses
7 DLC Cars
8 less engaging than previous forzas
9 no CLUBS!
10 price of DLC and the game come to over $130.00
one thing that has changed is the racing which is almost the whole game. When I first ever played forza I was terrible and I kept racing and racing and now I'm a pro at it I could race any course any difficulty manual with clutch no drive lines to follow and no traction control or stability control ABS etc.... How ever all these years I have raced this is the first game that any difficulty above EXPERT makes the AI drivers unbeatable for (example) if I Drive a Homologated"" Acura NSX"" on ""Road America"" and if all the AI's drive that same car they are garenteed to go faster than you around corners and on.
straights if I top out at 205mph they will blast past me @215mph! In the same car!!! You can complete the game about halfway before giving up on unbeatable. Also in this game the AI's do not register your car so if your turning they will side swipe you hate to say it but this IS my least favorite forza little time and effort was put into this one...prayers for forza horizion 4"
s,awsome it is a great game good grafics its a really great game
s,"The worst forza I have played I have been playing since FM5, and out of all the forza's, FM7 is the worst forza I have played. The Collectors tier takes away the ability to buy a car you want, the homologation takes away the point of tuning, the physics when you hit a tire wall is very unrealistic, when you rewind, the drivatars go crazy and hit everyone and some people online ram everyone and there is no penalty system. Forza, please fix this in FM8."
s,"Good graphics nothing inappropriate I honestly had a lot of fun playing this game, even know I've only played 2 Forza games (this one and Forza Horizon 4. so I'm not as experienced as some of you. I love the graphics there's a load of cars. But honestly I totally hate Micro-Transactions there just a pain in the butt and like for example the (Bugatti Chiron) you have to buy for what 3 bucks. And this game is like $60.00 and then you have to pay like $20 or 30$ dollars to make the game even better by a tiny bit. Also there's a awful lot of consumerism, like they literately put up ads when your racing that say (Forza Motorsport 7) and (Xbox One) its just a little annoying."
s,"Great game, Great for all ages really Its a great game way better than Forza 6, Great for all kids but just don't let them play online matches because of the lack of voice chat filter. Great for kids who like cars"
s,"Pretty good but you might wanna learn first Its very good and has realistic physics for a Sim-cade game. When you remove all assists you might want to learn to drive the car (shifting, racing line ect.) before playing some serious multiplayer. Also the reason there is a lot of billboards is because the real life tracks actually have Xbox and Forza Motorsport billboards (Lemans for example)"
s,"good, but not the best Forza motorsport 7 is fun, but not as good as 6 and 5. i suggest getting 6, because it has more (not essentially newer) cars, and is cheaper. also too much dlc :/"
s,A lot of fun This is a great game. You can race on some of the most famous routes and drive lots of different cars. Its really fun to race against friends and family and even by yourself on a empty track to see how fast you can go. Highly recommend
s,"Forza Motorsport 7, it's good! Forza Motorsport 7 is the seventh instalment of the Forza: Motorsport series. The game goes from the public roads to the circuit and legal streets. Vehicular violence isn't too present. Cars crash and are shown moderately damaged. Nobodies hurt."
s,"If you're able to play, then play! Forza Motorsport 7 is one of the latest installments of the Forza car racing series, with beautiful graphics and quality game play.
This game has absolutely NOTHING INAPPROPRIATE whatsoever, so if you're old enough to use an Xbox controller, then you're fine."
s,Nice Its not the best forza but it's still really great
s,"Absolutely amazing game with absolutely amazing graphics! I've been playing Forza ever since Forza Horizon 3 came out and Forza 7 is the best Forza yet. I enjoyed the new updates such as the new auction feature where you can auction off your cars with other Forza players. In the last Forza (Forza 6), you could only sell these cars to basically, no one. You just got game credits in return. I also enjoyed the amazing graphics and realistic sounds, just as if you were there! I again liked how Forza made it harder to get cars in Forza 7. In Forza 6, it was way too easy to get cars and it just wasn't fun after a long period of time. I also think this is why Forza added new cars to Forza 7. Overall, I think this is the best car video game on the market currently. I would totally recommend this game to anyone who is interested in cars, like I am."
s,Great update to a great series. I really liked this game.
s,Best forza game It is realy good. But expensive though. But worth it.
s,Magnificent Magnificent gameplay and beautiful serene adventuring around the beautiful world. Kids love riding around on the horse and the world is safe. Colossi are difficult but not scary. The spray shadows not blood. Basically PG till one cut scene in the end and an eight or nine-year-old could complete it.
s,"Disappointing. For such a critically acclaimed game, Shadow of the Colossus is a bitter disappointment. After a long and tedious cutscene, you find yourself in a world of almost no possibilities. Aside from the main story (which is only about 8 hours, including the time it takes to move from one colossus to the next) there is nothing to do. There are no side quests, no collectibles, nothing like that at all. There aren't even any NPCs to interact with or smaller enemies to fight on your way to the boss fights. This makes the already bland world even more dull and empty. Fighting the 16 colossi that the game has to offer is fun at first (the opening fifteen minutes of the game, aside the cutscenes, is actually pretty good), but after a while becomes repetitive and boring. It's just the same thing over and over again, not to mention that they are so damn hard to find in the first place. Needless to say, I would not recommend Shadow of the Colossus to anyone. 4/10, don't waste your time."
s,Not bad at all Only bad thing is blood. But that is literally it
s,"Not that bad Seriously, this game deserves a E10+ rating. The blood is black liquid sprayed by monsters and the violence is kind of fantasy. So the rating should be E10+ for Fantasy Violence. Very hard to learn without YouTube. You are fighting for love."
s,No words... This game has challenging bosses and sword/bow and arrow violence. The scale of this game will have your mouth open in awe. This game is well worth the $40.
s,"Great Alt ought the game contains some violence, killing giants and spirits it's a great game that has a character trying to save his loved one and fighting for her, i don't care there is violence i think 7 years old can handle it"
s,"Overated and boring, has terrible controls. Nowhere as good as people are saying. There's potential somewhere in Shadow of the Colossus to be sure, but it's just not a very fun game as it is. The controls are clunky, the fights are repetitive, and the world just feels so boring and empty. I honestly don't see how this game benefits from being open-world at all. And riding through the empty landscape, which is completely devoid of any kind of life spare the odd lizard, is just really, really boring. In games like Skyrim or Red Dead Redemption 2, the world is teeming with life, and you never know what random thing is going to suddenly pop-out in front of you to draw your interest, whether it's a hungry bear wanting to eat you or the distant screams of an NPC in need. But in Shadow of the Colossus: nothing. None of that. It's simply dull. I honestly can't see how people criticised Fallout 76 for being ""empty"" and then praise this game for this game for the exact same thing. It makes no sense. Maybe you'll enjoy this game, who knows, most other people have seemed to, but in my opinion, this game is mediocre at best. The graphics may be good, but good graphics can't redeem an otherwise poor game."
s,"Good But Challenging Shadow of the Colossus is an interesting game. This version is a remake (not remaster) of the game from 2005. It tells the story of a man named Wander and his horse, Agro trying to bring a woman back to life. You must do this by slaying the 16 colossi that roam the land. The game starts out easy enough but after defeating a few of these monsters the difficulty increases. I constantly found myself watching youtube tutorials to see how to take the colossi down. The reason for this is that you are given very little instruction on how to do stuff and even when given, it was very vague. This could be frustrating for some people. The violence isn't horrible, but when you hit the colossi's weak spots, black blood streams out everywhere. The end scene is also a bit violent (thought I'm not going to spoil it here). After you finish the campaign there isn't too much extra content. There is a time attack mode and a new game+ but not much else. This is a good game I would recommend getting due to its good story, beautiful open world and fun (but difficult) fights."
s,"Fun It is a fun game, but it does have blood. You basically figure out how to get on to 16 different monsters and then scale them to get to their weak points. Then you stab it and there is a gush of black blood. The monsters are not very scary and shouldn't give most kids nightmares. The graphics are amazing and totally worth the buy. Thanks for reading my review"
a,"Comedic slasher game, not sure why the age rating is so high.. Sure, it has gore and violence, but the whole game is made comedic and satirical, so why is it rated 15+?"
s,"Challenging but Rewarding City Builder/Steampunk/Survival Game Violence: Overall grim tone, some text references to death and violence. A handful of still images depict small amounts of blood. | Sex: One building that can be built is a brothel, however, nothing is shown and there's no descriptive dialogue either. | Language: Rare instances of ""hell"" and ""f*ck"" in text. | Drugs: Passing references to alcohol."
s,"Frostpunk (now available on steam) Game is very kid friendly, could be compared to games such as minecraft (but there are no zombies)
You start in the cold off with no shelter no food and many people. Make your own laws such as improving people's lives through making care homes for the physically disabled or even inventing new recipes to feed more people while using less materials.
Overall a good game with good challenges and never a boring moment."
s,"Great storyline, M rating is WAY too high. Frostpunk is a great game filled with challenges and storyline. However, I believe the M rating is way too high!
First off, it says there's strong language which isn't true! I have played a lot of this game and have only ever seen one F word which was in the DLC Last Autumn where (Skip the next line to avoid spoilers)
Your superstitious workers see an owl and start to slow down work because they think it is a bad Omen in which your only response is ""F*** Owls"" so if you don't want your child seeing that then don't get the *COMPLETELY OPTIONAL* Last Autumn DLC
The next one I'd like to address is violence/blood in which the only blood I could find is a doctor holding a bloody rag as one of the icons for one of the laws in the game and other than that there is only mentions of violence such as ""A women assaulted her neighbor for fear he was spying on her"" or such as that.
Lastly, it is listed that there is ""sexual themes"" in the game which isn't true! The only thing that can be close is that you can sign a law in which prostitutes are added into public houses (taverns) which don't tell your child anything about what those are so if your child doesn't know what a prostitute is they wont learn what it is and if they do then it'll be nothing new.
All in all if your child is 11+ then this game is good for them!"
a,"Frostpunk is a very fun and well made city building game- but it's not for younger kids. This game is very good! It is very fun and interesting, and will make you sweat as you try and keep your city of New London alive! The one thing I will say is this game is NOT FOR YOUNGER KIDS! If you can't handle: extremely depressing scenarios, suicide, cannabilism, murder, mass death, and anxiety, this is not for you. One of the most bleak and cold games I have ever played. Sorry, but your little Minecrafters shouldn't be on this game."

s,"I have 2 kids 9 and 14 It’s a great game and I have searched for ages to find one appropriate for both my kids. Although the point is to push, knock, throw the other player off the map there is no real violence or bad content. Both my kids are loving it and I am really happy."
s,"Good for a spread of ages I have to kids an 8 year old and a 13 year old, and have spent a long time trying to find a game that is ok for both of them, and this is definitely the one. Their is actually none of all the stuff described in 10 + reviews. And although knocking the other player off the edge of the map is the aim it’s all cartoon and there is no real violence or blood no one gets hurt."
s,"why is smash ulltimate rated e10+ Because smash has special skills but there is no blood and gore added to
the game. There is no bad language but some characters wear skylight
suits which shows some sex refrences but there is no alcohol and drug
abuse in this game."
s,this is how the review should be its a game where you attack people but it should not get this 12 + rating it should have a 9+
s,"It's a beat'em'up with no blood or gore. Given the genre it is exactly what you'd expect, punching, kicking, throwing fire balls etc. but all very tame.
A really good beat'em'up with a tonne of content."
s,"super fun! Such a fun game! As a family we really enjoy playing it together. Lots of different characters to get and play with. 8+ because some characters have revealing clothing- not too big of a deal, but worth mentioning (so annoying that game developers even add that...). Overall lots of fun!! Definitely recommend it!"
s,"Appropriate and entertaining For my kids 9 and 11 years old, it was a really fun game that kept them entertained on long trips and other journeys. It went really well with their recent purchase another set of joycons and when I looked at it seems to be appropriate."
s,"Eh... Maybe This game is revolved around fighting which already is a minus, In this game u can master the game pretty easily but its not too good for new gamers, but overall besides the violence and the consumerism its not that bad!"
s,"SO MUCH FUN I play this game soo much that it is embarrassing. Great game if you want to have a family game night. Well, family game night for kids 9+... I suggest to anyone who owns a Nintendo Switch.
Retails at $59.99

What’s in the game?
Violence - Violence is the point of the game, as you brawl against every character for domination. You'll use fists, feet, weapons, objects, special skills to defeat enemies by launching them off the screen. Cartoonish nature and lack of blood and gore lighten impact of gameplay.
Privacy Concerns - Can play with people all around the world.
Sexy Costumes - Some female characters wear skintight costumes."
s,Truly the ULTIMATE game Packed with content that will keep me playing for years to come. Every Switch owner should buy this game
s,Amazing Game but... it's not Melee
s,"Really good and engaging game This was the first game I played on my switch. Nothing in this game is inappropriate except for VERY low violence, and no blood is shed. There are DLCs in the game (Fighters you must buy with $$) and they are not worth it. Its worth the cost of $60 itself. Buy it and have a fun 22 hours of play!"
s,"Why Smash Bros. Is A Great Game For Everyone Fighting games realize it or not, are very good for the human body. Learning patience to master a hard to play game takes a lot of effort and memorizing all the button presses to activate your combo is captivating. Maybe not for really little kids because it is pretty difficult and your spoiled little baby might not like it and continue playing Fortnite, but this game is one of the best I ever played. It has lovable characters with such creative and quirky personalities. As funny as it is, this game can also lead into a well paying job, people win more than 1 million dollars a year winning tournaments of this game, where they practice and meet new friends, and also get the dough!"
s,BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEST!!!! Super Smash Bros. ULTIMATE is the best game eveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!
s,"Knowledge needed and rewarded ten times over The only downside is that characters you don’t know of in this game are probably seen as strange, and some are suggestive in some way
That is nothing compared to the positives that this game brings to all
This series is beautiful and WILL stand the test of time as it brings together so many people from every spectrum of the gaming fandom; I should know, games I never heard of before were introduced to me the first time I played this series, and I will forever be grateful got how many lives this game has changed (including mine)
Bless you Sakurai: you are a true hero"
s,"A must-have for any Nintendo Switch owner. A combination of an anime-style graphics game, a crossover fighting game, and even has a story mode. Thanks, Sakurai. Super Smash Brothers Ultimate is a 100% MUST-HAVE for any Nintendo Switch owner and anyone who's into crossover fighting games.
There really is no inappropriate stuff. Sure, fighting is the main focus of the game, but it has very anime-style graphics, and there's no blood involved.
However, quite a few characters come from T or M rated games such as Joker from Persona 5, Bayonetta from the Bayonetta series, Solid Snake from Metal Gear Solid, Cloud Strife from Final Fantasy VII, and others. The controls of the game are easy to get used to, and there's an in-game tutorial on how to play. There are 70+ fighters and a little over 100 arenas.
From the game menu, there are several gamemodes: Regular Battles,(in the Smash category), World of Light(the game's story mode), Online Battles,(which requires Nintendo Switch Online), and in the Games and More section, there are some other minigames.
There is also downloadable paid content, or DLC. This is content that is not available through normal gameplay. The first one, a standalone fighter, was Piranha Plant from the Mario series. After that, they made a ""Fighter Pass"", which contains 5 challenger packs. Buying the Fighter Pass grants you access to its content as soon as they are developed. Each challenger pack contains one fighter, a soundtrack, and a stage. The first Fighter Pass has the DLC fighters Joker (from Persona 5), Hero (from the Dragon Quest series), Banjo-Kazooie (from Banjo-Kazooie), Terry Bogard (from the Fatal Fury series), and Byleth (from Fire Emblem: Three Houses). Bandai Namco and Sora Ltd. (the developers) are also developing a second Fighter Pass, which will be completed by December 2021, and this one will contain 6 challenger packs. They also revealed that the first DLC fighter in the second Fighter Pass will be from the ARMS game. Piranha Plant (Piranha Plant is a standalone fighter, so he is not part of a Fighter Pass) costs $5.99, the first Fighter Pass costs $24.99, and the second Fighter Pass costs $29.99. You can also buy each Challenger Pack individually if you'd like.
Overall, the game is pricey at $59.99, but it is definitely worth it. Thank you, Masahiro Sakurai (the director)."
s,SSBU Rating and Review why Rate this 12+ It Should've been rated 9+ I Remember getting this when I turned 9 and it was cool But the smash Bros World Of Light is Extremely Hard and characters like sephiroth steve mario donkey kong bowser sonic are cool
s,"Cool game with your favorite nintendos So super smash bros is really cool. Mild violence though in scenes like fighting, flashing lights and people beating up each other. It’s really exciting and heart pumping, and good for your tween if they love nintendo characters."
s,Great Game! It’s good with tons of characters and it’s great in the game with tons of items and libraries of songs that play.
s,"A challenging and fun game It is fun because its a game where you get better and better by practice. The different difficulties of cpu's can give you a personalized practice match where you can get better. You have 70+ characters to choose from (some are DLC), very simple fighting style, and you can fight pvp. I don't see anything inappropriate in this game, you can't text or send messages through the game so the only way to do something inappropriate is with the character, which I don't see possible because even if you do find a way to be inappropriate, witch I have been playing this game for years, they wouldn't be able to for more than 1 second before they get hit. Overall, I say it's an amazing and wonderful game."
s,"Good game Not much bad stuff to say. Amazing game. Note that there are a few characters for, series rated T or M (Ken, Ryu, Sephiroth, Cloud, Bayonetta, Snake, Joker from Persona, Street Fighter, Bayonetta, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear series in no particular order) and a child May want to find out more about those characters and play their games."
a,Blood It has blood but censor when you use sheik's final smash and it is violent. i like the game it cost like 50 dollars and you have to buy extra characters
s,"Easy to play A fighting game that is very creative and easy to play. I mean yes, ther is voilence, but now realy in games like brawl stars is voilence without a goal. But in Smash bros. you need to fight angaist the darkness. Isn't that a cool and good concept?"
s,"I am sorry CSM but.... 12+? This game has no blood, does not really have talking so it has no swearing, the only reason it could be ""restricted"" is because of the fighting which is the main point of the game. It is not realistic and is fine for any age. The only reason you made need to be older is because of the controls but if they can learn it they can play it."
s,This is Amazing For Those 10 And Up Kids Can play these awesome game for children and adults ages 10 and up
s,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate This game was extremely fun, and actually has a good adventure mode plot, and can introduce new characters from Nintendo that people have never heard of."
s,Fighting but............ the game has fighting but there is no graphic blood yet your goal isnt to terminate the characters
s,"Best Game. Period. Boom. True Facts. 63 playable characters is MAD! With a deep, competitively played fighting system. It couldn't get better! A wide range of characters from many franchises. A percentage of them not even Nintendo properties! With a story mode FINALLY, Smash Bros is at it's peak! You are doing something wrong if you don't have this game. It's worth buying a Switch for."
a,"Easy to play, hard to master. Super smash Bros. ultimate (SSBU) is great. great gameplay, visuals, multiplayer, everything. But here are some warnings, some of the spirits , fiora, cheerleaders, elite beat divas, etc. are somewhat scantily clad, as well as some of the characters, zero suit samus, pyra/mythra, but not anything that will make you squirm. one of the spirits is the devil (cuphead) but it is not scary, and is very cartoonish, as it cuphead itself. one of the assist trophies says ""drinks on the house"" when he leaves, and mario appears to die in the dark ending of the story mode. make sure kids don't get creative with camera mode, as you can look up the skirt of certain characters, such as zelda. but this is a great game, and if you are thinking about buying a switch, this is the game to get with it."
s,"Appropriate for kids who known about WW2 There is not much blood in the game, if someone gets shot, stabbed or blown up the just go limp with a small squirt of blood. There isint to much language, nothing that a mature 10+ year old couldn't handle. The game is also very good so your child should like it. My 12 year old daughter asked for it so I checked it out and I think before you let your kids play this game you should watch something like band of brothers or saving private ryan with them and if you they can handle that then they are pretty much good to go, just make sure they also know a good amount about WW2 and then I think you It is fine for them.
Also sorry if my English isn't that good it is my second language."
s,It has a ton of gore and language but not that bad! If you have played things like call of duty world war 2 then you can start playing this game and i mean like... why not? A 12 year old is just starting to grow up and use this language when you are not looking so honestly... like i said before why not
s,"Its pretty good. alright, to start this off, this is probably my least favorite battlefield game. and number two, common sense is very strict. like it probably has the most lanuage out of any battlefield game, but eh, i dont really care about language. it also has blood and violence like any other battlefield game. by the way, i dont care about violence, consumerism, or language. but what I do care about, is sex. and none of these battlefield games have sex so yay. Thats why im so leanient. your welcome! :)"
s,"Wonderful Game! This game is lovely! My 12 year old daughter became very invested in WWII history and this a a great game to feed that fascination. Although there is minimal swearing, the rest of the game was delightful. There was no blood."
s,Great It isn’t gory and there a excellent role models
s,"Awesome action packed WWII shooter Battlefield V, one of the best shooters I have ever played did not happen to fail even the slightest. The action packed shooter leaves explosions going off everywhere you go and always a gunfight to enjoy, but I should be telling you my thoughts on its age rating. So first up this does not at all exceed an M+17 age rating! It is still, I would say recommended for very mature teens as when shot at, soldiers cry in pain bleeding out very realistically on the ground, blood covering the palm of their hands. Yet it seems really the only blood is them moments when you are bleeding out on the floor which can be quickly skipped. Gunfire is quick and blood is almost unnoticeable. Often when on the floor soldiers will shout out swears in whatever country they come from, whether that is in German, British, American whatever language. Most of the swears are quite little and nothing much but rarely the British will shout “f-cking help me!”. The game modes are very tactical and often require a lot of experience which can put the player off the game but it isn’t worth leaving such a good game! The sex is very slight, just some along the side in story missions but they are very little and hardly noticeable jokes. Young audiences can be exposed to online multiplayer game chat, being able to hear random people online which can be an issue but you can easily switch that off in settings no sweat. The Story and Multiplayer game modes show a lot of great messages proving well that you can win anything if you work as a team and I think this game deserves a 12+ rating!"
a,Fun game Battlefield V is a really fun game set in the WW2 era. It contains a wide variety of game modes and it also has single player missions. You can play as normal infantry control vehicles and fly planes. There isn't an excessive amount of violence but you do see a small spurt of blood when you kill an enemy. Infrequent swearing is also present in the game. Sometimes when you get knocked down your character swears. In the second single player mission there is some frequent swearing so if you don't want your kids to hear that then keep them away from that mission. No dismemberment is present in the game. I would recommend this game to any child over 13 but no younger.
a,"Not as bad as it seems. The first thing parents need to know is that common sense is over exagerating. This game should have been givin a T rating, cause its just like Star Wars Battlefront, with great graphics and little gore. When you shoot someone, a small splash of blood will fly up and then dissapear. I think the main problem with this game is the swearing. Unlike COD, theres no option to turn down the language but you can for the violence. The language isint that bad, just the everyday language you hear on the middle school playground. If you heard bad words before and wont use them than this game is FINE. Thank you for taking time to read this review."
s,YES A GREAT GAME!!!!!! But planes are hard to get in this game.
a,It has some violence but not something a 13 year old haven't played yet I think its ok for teens and up. Not tweens and kids though.
s,"Fun and exiting game! All around this game is great. the most swearing comes around when you're playing as a brit. Blood/Gore: If your child has seen movies such as Saving Private Ryan or 1917, the gore is a lot less than those movies. the most gory part are when enemies are being stabbed. swearing includes 2-3 f-words per game (depends if you're playing as a brit or not.) 4-5 s**t per game. thanks for reading my review and if you get the game, have as much fun is i have had! :)"
a,"Scampers away from the original charm of the series but is very fun. I am a professional PEGI reviewer. ( I gave this PEGI 16)This game is a must-have for teens. The violence is slightly overstated in the review. There is a very evident bloody spray when enemies are shot. There is a long-lasting blood mist when enemies are sniped. There is brief gore when enemies are shot. The game only shows evident gore when enemies are stabbed. The violence in my opinion is 8.5/10. Games which have this level of violence are Sekiro(8.7/10), the ghost of Tsushima(8.4/10), AC Unity(9/10). There is a great deal of language, f**k, sh*t, hell, damn, bastard, m*therf*cker, c*nt, ass, are all used commonly. The language is 9.6/10.(Worth noting that HARSH language is only used by brits.)
A few games which has this much language is GTA V(10/10), and Gears 5(9.8/10), and not much more. It is worth noting that language is only harsh when playing as a brit.(There is one 10 min war story without around 20 f words!) Language is present when playing as an American and German but the language is not as harsh(s words and b words) and they speak their native tongue. I think that the chaos of the multiplayer and the emotional power of the last tiger war story overshadow some of this mature content. This makes the game perfect for teens, thank you!"
s,"Fun, historically inaccurate, kids can handle the violence This game isn’t anything special, but it is fun to play and has a good multiplayer. The violence in the game consists of anything you could do in an actual war, mainly being guns, knives, and explosives. There is blood but not really any gore, and the blood is minimal. There is explicit language in cutscenes, but it’s nothing a teen wouldn’t hear in the hallways. My main problem with the game is that it isn’t historically accurate. Guns are much more diverse and colorful than they actually were and the campaign, (except for “The Last Tiger,) is made up or incorrect in many aspects. The most historically accurate experience in this game is the conquest game mode."
s,"Perfect for ages 13 and up This game is perfect for kids who can handle a bit of violence and blood, know that none of it is real ww2 footage and isn’t a sociopath.
Perfect for lads named Tom L"
a,good game it is only violent in the war stories so if you let your kid play i surgest not letting them play the campain
a,"NOT BAD GOOD FOR PRETEENS Fine for eleven or up, violence blood, language, but language is mainly in the cutscenes which you can skip"
s,"Great game! It's both educational and fun, and I think should be played by everyone age 9+!"
s,"Safe Violent Video game. But sacrifices preservation of actual history Battlefield 5 is the fifth one in the legendary selling series. But I know you don't care about that, I know why you are here. Is this game violent? Unless you find pg-13 action movies too much for your child then no. Will this desensitize my kid and turn him into a younger version of Osama Bin Laden and or Hitler? Absolutely not, in fact i'm scared if you think that. Do I think this teaches you anything? No I don't, as a person who values historical accuracy and the preservation of history I do not. The story mode for this game is not accurate and ignores obvious facts at one point they attribute the liberation of a town in Norway to one person they don't mention the resistance fighters who fought for it and died they ignore them, to push their own agenda, not to mention the ninja sword and a woman with a prosthetic hook for a hand in the reveal trailer. Do i think that this game is too violent no, do i think this game is going to make you kid into a psycho like the media is trying to say, no i do not. But i am unhappy with the disrespect of history. So if you son/daughter wants this game by all means let them have it, but mention to them that the war stories are not true and are fake, They should find this game fun though, and you will too if you try it and get good at it. The bad language is really basic and your child is gonna be fine assuming that hes 12 and or 11. Plus he/she has most likely defiantly heard it before in the movies. People i have noticed on this site are over praising this game i suggest buying call of duty world at war if your child has a pc and or ps3 or xbox 360. You can read my review on it when you search up Call of Duty World at War."
a,"Please read this review I have rated this game 15+ for violence and bad language, Violence 4.5/5 you shoot, stab, club and throw grenades to kill enemy players, resulting in puffs of blood as infantry, in vehicles you shoot explosive shots from tanks and can shoot a machine gun, the explosive kills do not have blood or dismemberment but do send people flying, in planes you can drop bombs on people and vehicles but all violence is off screen and you only know that you kill people because of the kill feed. In a cutscene somebody is shot at point blank range with a small puff of blood, you hit somebody's head on a table.
Language 5/5 frequent use of f**k and s**t even online, from your character, and one use of c*nt."
s,"Disrespects ww2 vets Not historically accurate at all. Represents disabled women fighting in America s frontline which we know is inaccurate. It takes away the realism of previous battle fields to make it “politically correct” and not offend SJWs. As a woman I am proud to play as a man because it was them who fought on the frontlines and woman who did the equally important role of healing them, caring for the children, etc. Also , if EA wanted to be politically correct they could have touched on the great female Russian snipers who killed countless nazis and not have put their own spin on the war and still call it accurate."
a,"Thrilling campaign filled with violence and profanity While there is a lot of violence and blood, there is little gore, and it is not emphasized. Language is consistent but powerful."
a,This game is awesome Now common sense media again with there fake reviews is of course wrong again this game is alright for people 13+ the reason for this is because this game teaches u about something historical yes it does have a fair amount of profanity in it yes it does have violence but when ur at school and ur learning about the punishments from the past then I'm pretty sure this game is fine.
s,"Ok for mature teens This game is good for kids that love their history, preferably ww 2 history. It’s a great game and gets you involved in action packed team cooperation. Although most parents write that the language is bad you can turn that off by selecting the Lange that your characters speaks during battle. It’s probably the least violet in the battlefield franchise, and probably the best. I totally recommend getting the game."
s,GREAT GAME! Honestly the best game of all time.
s,"it is a good game but definitely not as good as battlefield 1 I haven't played the campaign because the campaign in the 1st one was terrible in my opinion, but the multiplayer was fantastic in that game. Ok back to battlefield V, I think the most gruesome part in the game is when you are nocked down and you can see blood in your characters arms and he is shouting for help. Not that much swearing and there is a bit of blood when you shoot someone but that is it."
s,"Super good game!!! This game is very educational yes it does have some blood and gore things like that but if there mature it does have some language as well, but it's only in the campaign not online."
a,"Great WW2 game Great WW2 game, but bloody and lots of cursing. I have been just walking around and my character drops an F-bomb out of no where. I personally don’t mind, but if your kid is sensitive, or you don’t want them around that stuff, this is not the game for them."
a,"Good game, but mature The game is realy good, but sure, is not for young kids. Mature war stories in a good game. Its very heavy violence, but emotional."
s,not really much gore or blood not really much gore or blood
a,Sensitive topics but great game It’s pretty heavy with violence and swearing but not in multiplayer. There are great role models and it’s very educational. The gore isn’t crazy but blood does spray on the walls. I would say 11+ for multiplayer and 13+ for war stories. (Story mode)
s,"Not that violent Everything in this game is tedious stealth and annoying enemies. I can't stand the controls, they're almost as bad as rdr2's controls"
a,“Historically accurate” Good game. Campaign has racist jokes and violence. But as a german you can have a tommy gun and a m1911 and vice versa.
a,"Player needs to be mature. Parents, i know you are hard on critic and don't want your child playing violent games.
I think every child at 13+, that can see blood (no way to disable blood), is mature enough to play it.
Maybe consider purchasing it over Steam, and checking how your child does with the campaign and multiplayer modes. If it doesn't fit, you can cancel the order before 14 days and less than 2 hours."
s,Great game This is a very good ww2 shooter game. It has some spurts of blood when you kill someone but otherwise no gore and no language anyone 13+ hasn’t already heard. Some may consider this game pay to have an advantage but it’s really not.
a,"Bland multiplayer, decent campaign Battlefield V is by far the worst in the series. But that's not to say it's particularly a bad game. The multiplayer is pretty bland is feels very similar to Battlefield 1 with not many changes to gameplay.
Although similar to Battlefield 1's format, single player was pretty entertaining for the most part.
Violence is a little more mild than previous mainline games. Blood spurts and bleeding out is present during combat. Implied dismemberment in one cutscene.
Frequent strong language during single player War Stories. Use of ""f#!k"", ""c#nt"", ""$h!t"" and ""b!#ch."" Infrequent use of sexual expletives (use of ""tit"")."
a,"Great game. Amazing storyline, and great missions. It really shows what it’s like to be a soldier during WWII. Should be rated T. Some PG-13 movies are even worse than this game. The only reason it’s rated M is because there’s a lot of swearing. The word c*nt is even used once, but this is only in one mission, and it’s not like kids this age don’t hear this stuff already. There is also a lot of blood in the game, but again, there’s a lot of movies rated PG-13 that are full of blood and gore! I think this game is just fine for anybody 13 and up. There is also online interactive gameplay that some may be worried about. As long as your kid knows not to trust strangers, and to be respectful to others online and has good sportsmanship, you’ll be fine! This stuff happens in the real world, and teens need to know about it. Many are also learning about WWII at this age in school, and this would be a great way to understand it better, to experience it!"
a,"Good for teens It's a great game with a good story and multiplayer. It has little blood when you kill someone, but you only see it for a second. Dead bodies have some blood but otherwise not very bloody. Some swearing but definitely not as bad as other Battlefield games. If your child is mature enough, they will love it."
a,"Historical, Fun, Semi-Educational. But there is blood and mild gore involved. This game is pretty good, not my favorite but was for a while before I found Forza and Far Cry.
Swearing: In the 2nd mission, quite a few. of uses of F*** and S*** and even one use of C***. The rest of the game is not spoken in english.
Violence and gore: Crazy blood spray with headshots, more than Far Cry 5. Players can perform brutal knife takedowns which can be pretty unsettling at times. I can't quite remember but I'm pretty sure there is a chance you can impale enemies (ouch) Knifes to the chest, near the heart and the neck. You can throw your knife at enemies as well. there is some gore here, As Well as close up shotgun or rifle blasts but the gore is very mild and pretty unrealistic. Not just knives but bayonets, spades, hatchets (axes) and more.
So, sounds violent right? Well it is an R16 game but the violence is still really gruesome, But this is overweighed by the history and educational factor. I convinced my parents to get me this game because it heavily revolves around history.
This game has no Inappropriate content at all."
s,This is the best game ever!!! While the game play and graphics are great you can clearly see blood on the ground and on walls. If you mute it during cut scenes and are okay with some blood this is the perfect game for you. There are no guts or flying body parts. It does show the heroism and courage of the solders in world war 2.
s,Family frendly Easy to play no cussing very good for good for kids to have fun and enjoy a nice entertaining game for kids to have a blast not so much violence
s,"Great Game, No Complaints I think this an amazing game, one of the best I’ve played in awhile. It has great controls, as well as a great character selection, funny scenes, and two good storylines following both The Incredibles 1 and 2. I highly recommend this for anyone 9+ [Because kids below that age (from past experience) don’t really understand “how things work”]"
s,"Really awesome game. I just started to play this game last week, and it was a great game! All I have to do is save three men. I’ve practiced all the moves on Lego The Incredibles, because I know all the controls now. I think Frozone is the coolest character in this game, because ice follows him when he ice skates, and when he stops ice skating, the ice stops following him. Lego The Incredibles has not that much violence, so that is why I rate it for ages 7+."
s,"Fun! I love playing this game so much! I love the story part of it and the free play part. My 8 and 10 year old cousins, my 13 year old sister and I play this together all the time and we love it so much!"
s,"INCREDIBLY disappointing The title is right. Lots of boring missions, tons of obnoxious glitches (I found myself getting cars stuck in corners) and overall, good idea, but bad execution."
s,"Very good game It has cool characters, a great combat system (the violence is somewhat toned down due to the use of Lego characters), brilliant gameplay in story levels and a huge open world. Hours and hours of entertainment."
s,One Of the best games I think this game is ten and up because kids can handle the swearing
a,"Good they have a naked magazine in the dad's closet
the dad constantly drinks
the kid tries smoking a cigarette
the dad curses a lot
the dad hits the child"
a,Emotional This is a great free game to get before you buy Life is Strange!!!&lt;33 Has A HELLA LOT of Alcoholism and shows clear signs of child abuse. If you're over the age of 13 it's worth a try.
a,"Scenes of (verbal) child abuse and bad language. Fun story about a kid who wants to be a superhero, there are a few scenes including alcohol and smoking, also verbal child abuse, however nothing terrible."
a,"A good story with strong language. (Mild Spoilers)
Chris is a 9 year old boy whos mother died in a car crash and his dad is a alcoholic.
The game contains strong language and heavy drinking including Whiskey and beer. The language uses F*ck S*it and G**D*** and B**tard. In one scene you steal your dad's car keys."
s,"Please read this review I rated this game 7+ for hard gameplay.
The controls are easy but the game is hard, it gives good messages that you need to work in a team, the king onion reminds you to work together after every world. Buy this game for your kids, it is really good"
s,"Stellar game that might break some bonds. This is a very good game to play with your spouse, a sibling or a kid. You take the role of various chefs and must work together to prepare meals. The premise is simple but there is quite a large amount of chaos going on, forcing you to communicate. It encourages teamwork but wont be good for anyone very competitive. 8/10."
s,"Much better than the first game I rated the first game 3/5 stars (you can see my review on that if you want) because it was only local co-op and my family and I didn't have any controllers at the time. Anyway, my dad bought this game for me on PS4 last night because it was on my wishlist. I love it! There's Practice Mode and Online Multiplayer, unlike in the first game. And from playing Online, I suddenly remembered how chaotic Overcooked really is XD I'm addicted to this game."
s,This game can be for any age This game can be for any age but it’s complicated I am 14 years old and had a hard time understanding how to play
s,"My family loves it! Me and my family play this game almost every Friday night! It’s a great game to learn team work, it is frustrating sometimes because you are either burning something or someone is trying to get there food. It is very easy to play if you know how to use a Nintendo switch controller, would definitely recommend!"
s,5- Rated pegi 5-
s,yes yeh
s,Worst NHL yet I’ve played every NHL since 06 and I have to say this one is by far the worst. I’ve had the game 1 day and I already wanna tip my hair out. I can’t poke check anyways without tripping them and you get a penalty every time u touch another player. I tried avoiding touching the other team to avoid penalties but then you get your butt kicked. This game needs a major redo and I’m highly disappointed in this game. Do not bother buying unless you wanna get extremely frustrated every time you play it.
s,Trash I love the fact that the games take 30 mins to play because there’s 20+ penalty minutes for each team. I rate this game 2/10 stars.
s,"Fun game for hockey fans NHL 19 is one of the better recent entries in the franchise. It's nowhere near as good as the classic games or NHL 21 for that matter, but it remains a solid experience. I love the NBC broadcasting themes in the game. I know that could be considered consumerism, but i love authenticity in sports games, so seeing a licensed network in a sports game is always cool. Controls are easy, Be A Pro is the best mode, and everything else is relatively niche. Hockey Ultimate Team is not as bad as Madden Ultimate Team, but it still pushes you to buy new cards with real money. World of Chel is a solid arcade mode, with many different gameplay styles to choose from. Be A Pro lets you create a custom player to your statistics and simulate an NHL career. You can get drafted by teams, cut, waived, sent to lower leagues, and even retire with full benefits. Its a fun mode and currently the best simulation career mode in sports games. All in all, NHL 19 is a solid game. It has been delisted from digital storefronts, so the only way to play it is on disc, but if you have Xbox Game Pass then you can play the new and improved NHL 21 for no additional cost."
s,"I have played this game once. I say it’s for 6 or 7 and up. This game is Pretty fun. The only NHL game that I have is NHL 11, one of the older ones."
s,very hard to play 
s,"amazing This game is a favourite of mine being a hockey fan, the game is good for 6yr olds my, brother had a little learning the controls"
s,"Good game It's fights are way overrated, you can turn them off and body checking is part of the sport. Don't under stand 10+ the only reason I said 3+ is because 3 year olds wouldn't be big enough to hold th controller. Good for anyone who likes hockey!"
s,Great game probably one of the better nhl games I have played. The first version i played was NHL 12 which was not bad but then I got NHL15 and it was a complete dumpster fire and I decided to give 19 a chance and it was everything I had hoped for and more. good gameplay more modes then any other NHL game and new pond feature. the only problem is the referring is wild they call the slightest trip but no goalie interference? Hopefully it will be fixed in the next installment.
s,awsome!!!!!!!!!!!! It has no violence
s,great it is very fun
a,not as bad as it seems This game seems like it should not be 18+. All of the gore settings and profanity can be turned off in settings. I bought it for my 10 year old and it did not seem as serious of a military shooter as it advertises.
a,"12+ I think Cod Bo4 is a great game. A lot of parents don’t understand that you can turn off blood and gore. My children are allowed to play but have to have blood turned off and they can’t play zombies. If you turn off the blood it’s isn’t really bad. Most parents just don’t like to admit they’re child has grown up and play games like this. The rule for my children is when they turn 12 they can play. I say give it a shot, it isn’t as bad as people think. This website makes it look horrible but honestly it isn’t even that bad. I mean every kid needs freedom and needs to find out what they like. I say give it a shot. It really isn’t that bad and the trailer is worse because they are trying to sell the game. Also this game has no campaign which has the curse words. Zombies also has curse words but that’s why my children can’t play zombies."
a,"Fine for teens I think that this game is fine for anyone 14 and up. Definitely not for kids under that, though. The game settings allow you to turn off blood and gore, as my 14 year old showed me, but it is still very violent for immature kids. I also will still not let my kid play zombies, i have watched videos and it looks very intensely violent and gory. I trust my kid with a lot of things but will only let him play Blackout and Multiplayer, definitely no zombies for anyone under at least 16. The game also has lots of bad language but i'm sure that unless you are offended by bad language then it would be fine for 14+. Thanks for reading my opinion!!! I hope it helped."
s,"Amazing This game pretty much anyone can play,because of the setting to turn off blood"
a,Its good for teens It is not as violent as the reviews say. You can turn of blood gore and language. As long as that is turned off it is no worse than any PG-13 movie. If you are still wary about this game I would suggest watching some one play it. Make sure you watch somebody with blood and language off if you want your kid to have those toggled off.
a,"Suitable for 12 and up This game is suitable for ages 12 and up my 13 year old asked me to get this game for him reluctantly i said yes i saw the 18 on the cover and thought it would be to violent. I played the game myself and i seriously rate this game an 18 it is more like a 16, 13 at a push."
a,"Based on your child I think that this game is fine for teenagers, however if your child is rude or aggressive I think that your kid should wait for this game. You can turn off all of the blood and gore which also blocks out all of the swearing. With this mode on it is a Teen rated game and it just depends on whether your kid is mature enough for this game. It is all about if your kid is able to handle this game without becoming immature."
s,Get your kid this game! At first I thought that this game would be absolutely horrible and would not let my son get it. However he pleaded and at last i relented and since then I have realised that it is a fun and slightly unrealistic game. He had played it with his friends and has had a blast
a,"Listen This game is one I am sure a lot of parents are worried about. I have 3 children so trust me when I say this I can “relate” my son mak is 14 and was desperately wanting this game. Obviously I said no, however my wife allowed him, I just want to say I watch him play the game I will will give it too my wife I wish I had this game I just want to let you know blood,gore and swearing can be turned off, this means to me that the game is about a 14-16 still not his age range but it’s a great game and I find he hasn’t changed unlike he did with “fort night” let your children have the game only if their above 12 it’s good and I like it"
s,"An epic game that can be for anyone just needs the right setting I bought this game recently even tho the more recent Call of Duty is out (modern warfare remastered). Personally being the dad of four kids 3 boys. My youngest boy is 9 and my oldest is 12. I also have an 11-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl. I have been playing video games since the first doom came out and let me tell you games have changed. Anyway, the game is very easy to get right in and my 11-year-old boy I let him play and he loves it I also made sure that it wasn't too bloody or there wasn't too much swearing and it passed. Yes there is a setting to turn of the blood with I think is good but the blood itself is very minor. For the language, there can be the f word or the S word but you can turn off the dialogue but this isn't anything to bad. I do think that if your child starts saying these words you should ake the game away but personally the game isn't that violent a bit if shooting here and there but nothing an 8 year old can handle. Remeber that the title of M rated isn't really that true the blood isn't that bad also you can turn it off the dialogue can be turned off and the community isn't like other games also most people don't even use the microphones. If u think the game is pointless and stupid it isn't, kids will fight together in teams to outsmart the enemy in different tactics trying to capture the objectives and getting new weapons. For money and price, the zombie mode isn't worth buying its really just stupid and not fun also you cant turn off the blood in zombie mode but they look really ugly."
s,"Amazing game My son wanted the game, At first I wasnt having it my son kept on nagging i kept on saying no, no, no. He then bought this game behind my back I was watching him play it was while he was playing it I releasized that he got the game. It didnt look that bad I let him keep the game as it wasnt bad i Would definitely recommend getting this game as it wasnt bad at all, all the critics are way to critical as you can just turn off graphic content."
s,Probably the worst in the franchise but fine for kids 10 and up very small blood and that’s about it 
s,"Same game every year I am a professional PEGI reviewer and rate games on common sense media.org. I noticed that commonsense media consists of many fake parent reviews and I want to start a movement for change. Please check my reviews on popular games, for trustworthy and informative reviews. This game is just like any other call of duty game. Same game every year. There is frequent profanity throughout including f**k, s**t, hell, damn, b*tch, and bastard. language is 8/10. Violence is constant, gore can be turned off. All shots result in some blood and RARELY dismemberment. Blood can barely be seen from far.(sometimes it can't) This game as always will get a 13+.
