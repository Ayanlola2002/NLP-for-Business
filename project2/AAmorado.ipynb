            "Miami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . Siebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . Then Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . House throws wild With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . Catcher Frank House's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt . Then Heywood Sullivan , Kansas City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run . Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the A's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser , a wild pitch , and Frank Cipriani's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair's glove into center . The Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers . Three were doubles , Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding one . Hartman impressive Bill Kunkel , Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium . The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the fourth . Hartman , purchased by the A's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance , and merited the triumph . Keegan , a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder , gave up the Orioles' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally . Robinson doubles again In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left . Whitey Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base on balls . Then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce . Pete Ward was sent in for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of short . John Powell , batting for Adair , fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches , and Buddy Barker , up for Stepanovich , bounced out sharply to Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest . The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding , along with Robinson , the two Birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on Russ Snyder's single to right and crossed on Kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate . The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out . Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally . Lumpe errs Jim Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel's glove and beat it out for a single , and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error . Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners . When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut down in a close play at third , Tuttle to Andy Carey . The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went like this : Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center . Carey Singles Carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first . It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit . Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play . Breeding to Adair to Gentile , setting up Tuttle's 390-foot homer over the wall in left center . If the Orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days , it will have to be at the expense of the American League champion New York Yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test Sunday afternoon . Miami , Fla. , March 17 -- The flavor of Baltimore's Florida Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army's military training program and is ready for belated spring training . Hansen , who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a freshman average , completes the Birds' spring squad at 49 players . The big , 22-year-old shortstop , the 1960 American league `` rookie-of-the-year '' , flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $15,000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5-to-3 loss to Kansas City -- the winless Birds' sixth setback in a row . 15 pounds lighter The 6-foot 3-inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring . He hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three weeks hence . When he was inducted into the Army at Fort Knox , Ky. , Hansen's weight had dropped to 180 -- `` too light for me to be at my best '' he said . `` I feel good physically '' , Hansen added , `` but I think I'll move better carrying a little less weight than I'm carrying now '' . Seeks `` improved fielding '' The rangy , Albany ( Cal. ) native , a surprise slugging sensation for the Flock last year as well as a defensive whiz , set `` improved fielding '' as his 1961 goal . `` I think I can do a better job with the glove , now that I know the hitters around the league a little better '' , he said . Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two-game weekend series with the New York Yankees . Skinny Brown and Hoyt Wilhelm , the Flock's veteran knuckleball specialists , are slated to oppose the American League champions in tomorrow's 8 P.M. contest . Duren , Sheldon on hill Ryne Duren and Roland Sheldon , a rookie righthander who posted a 15-1 record last year for the Yanks' Auburn ( N.Y. ) farm club of the Class-D New York-Pennsylvania League , are the probable rival pitchers . Twenty-one-year-old Milt Pappas and Jerry Walker , 22 , are scheduled to share the Oriole mound chores against the Bombers' Art Ditmar in Sunday's 2 P.M. encounter . Ralph Houk , successor to Casey Stengel at the Yankee helm , plans to bring the entire New York squad here from St. Petersburg , including Joe Dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated for both weekend games . The famed Yankee Clipper , now retired , has been assisting as a batting coach . Squad cut near Pitcher Steve Barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the Army's accelerated wintertime military course , also at Fort Knox , Ky. . The 22-year-old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did Hansen . Baltimore's bulky spring-training contingent now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul Richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit . `` Take a ride on this one '' , Brooks Robinson greeted Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield wall tonight . It was the first of two doubles by Robinson , who was in a mood to celebrate . Just before game time , Robinson's pretty wife , Connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer . Unfortunately , Brooks's teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven-hit pitching of three Kansas City rookie hurlers . Hansen arrived just before nightfall , two hours late , in company with Lee MacPhail ; ; J. A. W. Iglehart , chairman of the Oriole board of directors , and Public Relations Director Jack Dunn . Their flight was delayed , Dunn said , when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane . Ex-Oriole Clint Courtney , now catching for the A's is all for the American League's 1961 expansion to the West Coast . `` But they shouldda brought in Tokyo , too '' , added Old Scrapiron . `` Then we'd really have someplace to go '' . Bowie , Md. , March 17 -- Gaining her second straight victory , Norman B. , Small , Jr.'s Garden Fresh , a 3-year-old filly , downed promising colts in the $4,500 St. Patrick's Day Purse , featured seventh race here today , and paid $7.20 straight . Toying with her field in the early stages , Garden Fresh was asked for top speed only in the stretch by Jockey Philip Grimm and won by a length and a half in 1.24 3-5 for the 7 furlongs . 8,280 attend races Richard M. Forbes's Paget , which had what seemed to be a substantial lead in the early stages , tired rapidly nearing the wire and was able to save place money only a head in front of Glen T. Hallowell's Milties Miss . A bright sun and brisk wind had the track in a fast condition for the first time this week and 8,280 St. Patty Day celebrants bet $842,617 on the well-prepared program . Prior to the featured race , the stewards announced that apprentice James P. Verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and crossing the field sharply in two races on Wednesday . Culmone gets first win Garden Fresh , the result of a mating of Better Self and Rosy Fingered , seems to improve with each start and appeared to win the St. Patrick's Day Purse with some speed in reserve . She was moving up to the allowance department after winning a $10,000 claiming event . Cleveland , March 17 ( AP ) -- George Kerr , the swift-striding Jamaican , set a meet record in the 600-yard run in the Knights of Columbus track meet tonight , beating Purdue's Dave Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1 . Kerr , who set the world record earlier this month in New York with a clocking of 1.09.3 , wiped out Mills's early pace and beat the young Big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards . Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal Whitfield . Mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race . Then Kerr , a graduate student from Illinois , moved past him on a straightaway and held off Mills's challenge on the final turn . Mills was timed in 1.10.4 . The crowd at the twenty-first annual K. of C. Games , final indoor meet of the season , got a thrill a few minutes earlier when a slender , bespectacled woman broke the one-week-old world record in the half-mile run . Mrs. Grace Butcher , of nearby Chardon , a 27-year-old housewife who has two children , finished in 2.21.6 . She snapped five tenths of a second off the mark set by Helen Shipley , of Wellsley College , in the National A.A.U. meet in Columbus , Ohio . San Francisco , March 17 ( AP ) -- Bobby Waters of Sylvania , Ga. , relief quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League , will undergo a knee operation tomorrow at Franklin Hospital here . Waters injured his left knee in the last game of the 1960 season . While working out in Sylvania a swelling developed in the knee and he came here to consult the team physician . St. Petersburg , Fla. , March 17 ( AP ) -- Two errors by New York Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned runs and a 5-to-2 victory to the Chicago White Sox today .\n",

            "If we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization : science and religion . Science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom . Religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed . How can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ? ? We may feel pessimistic at the outlook . And yet there is a note of hope , because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision . We are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material , a universe that in a word is not matter but music . And it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith . Atomic energy To see this vision in perspective , we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom . You know that I could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on Hiroshima . It was only about the size of a baseball ; ; but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of 20,000 tons of Aj . That is enough TNT to fill the tower of the Empire State Building ; ; and with the availability of bombs of that size , war became a new problem . Now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world . But we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen bomb . Hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce . We know that we have hydrogen in water ; ; water is Af and the H stands for hydrogen ; ; there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies . I have calculated that if I could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body , I would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on Hiroshima . I won't try the experiment , but I think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go , there would be quite an explosion . And then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in Delaware Bay or in the ocean beyond . Salt water is still Af , the same hydrogen is there . And the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today . Of course , there is also an optimistic side to the picture . For if I knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity , I could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body I could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire United States for some days . And think , if we all knew this secret and we could pool our power , what a wonderful public utility company we would make . With just the hydrogen of our bodies , we could run the world for years . Then think of Delaware Bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come . It is power with which we can literally rebuild the world , provide adequate housing , food , education , abundant living for everyone everywhere . An octillion atoms Now let us see where this power comes from . To grasp our new view of the atom , we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is . I have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry . One night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table , and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms ; ; and I asked myself a question : Suppose I had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body , how large an area would they cover ? ? I calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human body ; ; that is a figure one with 27 ciphers , quite a large number . Then I calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator ; ; a billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic ; ; a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people ; ; and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of Philadelphia . I saw that I would soon run out of buildings at this rate , so I decided to take another measure -- the whole state of Pennsylvania . Imagine that there is a blizzard over Pennsylvania , but instead of snowing snow , it snows peas ; ; so we get the whole state covered with peas , about four feet deep . You can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars ; ; Pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas . But we still have a long way to go . Next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas of the entire globe -- North America , South America , Europe , Asia , and Africa , all covered with peas four feet deep ; ; then we have sextillion peas . Next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas , then we go out among the neighboring stars , collect 250 planets each the size of the earth , and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep ; ; and then we have septillion . Finally we go into the farthest reaches of the Milky Way ; ; we get 250,000 planets ; ; we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body . So you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are . A speck -- and space Now although an atom is small , we can still in imagination have a look at it . Let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that I swallow a magic Alice In Wonderland growing pill . I start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me . I shoot up through the roof , into the sky , past the clouds , through the stratosphere , out beyond the moon , out among the planets , until I am over a hundred and fifty million miles long . Then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a hundred yards across , a balloon big enough to put a football field inside . And if you should step inside of such a magnified atom , according to the physics of forty years ago , you would see circulating over your head , down at the sides , and under your feet , some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs . These balls are moving in great circles and ellipses , and are of course , the electrons , the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone . Since these electrons are moving like planets , you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom . So you look down there and you see a tiny , whirling point about the size of the head of a pin . This is the atomic sun , the atomic nucleus . Even if the atom were big enough to hold a football field , this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead . It is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits ; ; it also contains nearly all the mass , and the atomic energy . You may ask what else there is , and the answer is nothing -- nothing but empty space . And since you are made of atoms , you are nothing much but empty space , too . If I could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down , squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge , you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone , you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper . Someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing . At any rate , it shows us how immaterial we are . Music of the spheres Now this 1920 view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging picture . For we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics ; ; and therefore the atom was really just a little machine ; ; and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts . So if you are made of atoms , you are just a big machine ; ; and since the universe is also made of atoms , it is just a supermachine . And this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe , governed by the laws of cause and effect , bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom . And this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists . Then came the scientific revolution in the late 1920's . A suggestion from Louis De Broglie , a physicist in France , showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves . And to see the meaning of this new picture , imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today . Now as you step inside , instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets , you see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it . These ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral . And as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms , you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music . It is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony . Harmony , melody , counterpoint symphonic structure are there ; ; and as this music ebbs and flows , there is an antiphonal chorus from all the atoms outside , in fact from the atoms of the entire universe . And so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe , we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music . The Island of Nantucket , part of the State of Massachusetts , lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother State . Some of the Island is sand and is not suitable for living . The Island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors ; ; the rest is obtained from harbor scallops . During about three and a half months of the year , in the summer , there are three boats that run from the mainland to the Island carrying passengers , food , and cars ; ; but the rest of the year only one boat is needed , which ties up at the mainland nights and makes the trip down to Nantucket in the daytime . This is a fine trip , too , on a good day . With Martha's Vineyard on one side and the open sea on the other , it makes an excellent trip of about three hours .\n",

            "The Poynting-Robertson effect ( Robertson , 1937 ; ; Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth . The radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size -- a 1000-m-diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years . Whipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag . Further , the corpuscular radiation , i.e. , the solar-wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force . The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi-major axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun . Also , planetary gravitational attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached . At one astronomical unit from the sun ( the Earth's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular . If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about Af of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth . De Jager ( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect , which in this case causes the orbits to become more and more eccentric without changing the semi-major axis . This effect can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth . Since there is a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effects , there must be a continual replenishment : otherwise , micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary space . There are several possible sources . According to Whipple ( 1955 ) , cometary debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the sun , maintaining a fairly steady state . Asteroidal collisions are also thought to contribute material . It is also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the Earth originated from meteoritic impacts upon the moon . 5.3 direct measurements of micrometeorite flux One cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space . Even in the neighborhood of the Earth , where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly , the derived flux values vary by at least four orders of magnitude . This large discrepancy demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved . Beyond a few million kilometers from the Earth , but still in the region of the Earth's orbit , a prediction of the flux of dust is even more unreliable . At greater distances from the sun , the situation is still less certain . There are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment . Direct information has been obtained from rockets and satellites equipped with impact sensors . In addition , the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain . From the brightness of the F component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal light , an estimate of the particle sizes , concentrations , and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic plane . Another important source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component . The cores of deep-sea sediments and content of collectors in remote regions are valuable in this category . The data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth . The direct evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the Earth is obtained from piezoelectric sensors ( essentially microphones ) and from wire gages ; ; these instruments are installed on rockets , satellites , and space probes . Statistically , the most significant data have been collected from the sensors on 1958 Alpha ( Explorer 1 ) , 1958 Delta 2 ( Sputnik 3 ) , and 1959 Eta ( Vanguard 3 ) . These vehicles , with large sensitive areas , have collected data for long enough times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure . Many other vehicles with smaller sensitive-area exposure-time products contribute some information . The impact rate on 1958 Alpha for 153 events was Af for particles of mass greater than Af ( Dubin , 1960 ) ; ; this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration and an assumed impact velocity of Af . The data show daily and diurnal variations . Ninety per cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred between midnight and noon , and from day to day the variation of the rate was as much as an order of magnitude . One may conclude that most of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams which intersect the Earth's orbit . There have been contradictory reports from 1958 Delta 2 , and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable . On May 15 , a very large increase occurred with Af of mass between Af and Af ; ; for the next two days , the impact rate was Af ; ; and for the next nine days , the impact rate was less than Af ( Nazarova , 1960 ) . The data for the first day indicate a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux . Preliminary data from 1959 Eta give an average impact rate of Af for masses larger than Af for about 1000 events in a 22-day period ( LaGow and Alexander , 1960 ) . The day-to-day rate varied by less than a factor of 4.5 . The data have not yet been analyzed for diurnal variations . Note that the mass threshold is four times that of 1958 Alpha and that the flux is one fifth as large . If one assumes that the average flux did not change between measurements , a mass-distribution curve is obtained which relates the flux of particles larger than a given radius to the inverse 7/2 power of the radius . Space probes have yielded little information . Pioneer 1 , recorded a decrease in flux with distance from the Earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours . With detectors sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts , the second and third Russian space probes indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones . Being based on so few events , these results are of dubious validity . The calibration of piezoelectric sensors in terms of the particle parameters is very uncertain . Many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles , a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities . However , one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear relationship . In the United States , most of the sensors are calibrated by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces . The Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor . This `` ejection '' momentum is linearly related to the particle energy . They quote about the same mass threshold as that of the U.S. apparatus , but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater . There is a difference in the experimental arrangement , in that the U.S. microphones are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments are isolated from the skin . The threshold mass is derived from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of Af in the U.S. work and Af in the U.S.S.R. work . The threshold mass of about Af corresponds to a 10-M-diameter sphere of density Af . However , the conversion from mass to size is unreliable , since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy , loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as Af . To what extent such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown . The velocity value used is also open to some question ; ; if a substantial fraction of the dust is orbiting about the Earth , only about one third the above-mentioned average velocity should be used in deriving the mass . Zodiacal light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket , a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular orbits about the sun , as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible meteors . The diurnal variation in the observed flux may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity . The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data . A summary of meteorite data , prepared by Whipple ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is given in Table 5-1 . From an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero-magnitude meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in magnitude . The radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres of density Af except for the smallest particles , which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of solar-radiation pressure . The flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors . It is assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude , in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant . The values agree with the data from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta . The figures in the next-to-last column are derived with the assumption of 50 per cent shielding by the Earth ; ; hence , these figures apply immediately above the Earth's atmosphere . The unshielded flux is given in the last column ; ; these figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in interplanetary space near the Earth . Of course , if there is a dust blanket around the Earth , the fluxes in interplanetary space should be less than the figures given here . Note that the mass scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously used ; ; for example , Jacchia ( 1948 ) derived a scale of 0.15 g for a Af , zero-magnitude meteorite . The older scales were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into light . The mass scale used in Table 5-1 was derived on the assumption that the motion of the glowing trail is related to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite , permitting the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known ( Cook and Whipple , 1958 ) . A concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude ( Manning and Eshleman , 1959 ) . Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites . The approximate equation is Af , where N is the number of Af with electron line-density greater than or equal to Af , and Q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite . Therefore , N is inversely proportional to the radius cubed and in fair agreement with the inverse 7/2 power derived from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta data . At the fifteenth magnitude , Af , and at the twenty-fifth magnitude , Af . These extrapolated fluxes are about an order of magnitude less than the values from the satellite data and the figures in Whipple's table . The extrapolation may be in error for several reasons . The observational data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension into the micrometeorite region . The solar-electromagnetic- and corpuscular-radiation pressure and the associated Poynting-Robertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns . Also , it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites ( Best , 1960 ) , and the same distribution would not be expected . 5.4 . Indirect indications of micrometeorite flux A measure of the total mass accretion of meteoritic material by the Earth is obtained from analyses of deep-sea sediments and dust collected in remote regions ( Pettersson , 1960 ) . Most meteoritic material , by the time it reaches the Earth's surface , has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material in its passage through the atmosphere . For all meteorites , the average nickel content is about 2.5 per cent . This is much higher than the nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx . Present data indicate an accretion of about Af tons per year over the entire globe , or about Af .\n"
