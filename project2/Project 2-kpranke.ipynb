      "than it had done to Kynon; and Owain asked of him his road, and he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "showed it to him. And Owain followed the road, as Kynon had done, till\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he came to the green tree; and he beheld the fountain, and the slab\r\n",
      "\n",
      "beside the fountain with the bowl upon it. And Owain took the bowl,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and threw a bowlful of water upon the slab. And, lo, the thunder was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "heard; and after the thunder came the shower, much more violent than\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Kynon had described; and after the shower the sky became bright. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "when Owain looked at the tree there was not one leaf upon it. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "immediately the birds came, and settled upon the tree, and sang. And,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "when their song was most pleasing to Owain, he beheld a knight coming\r\n",
      "\n",
      "towards him through the valley; and he prepared to receive him and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "encountered him violently. Having broken both their lances, they drew\r\n",
      "\n",
      "their swords and fought blade to blade. Then Owain struck the knight a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "blow through his helmet, headpiece, and visor, and through the skin,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and the flesh, and the bone, until it wounded the very brain. Then the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "black knight felt that he had received a mortal wound, upon which he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "turned his horse's head and fled. And Owain pursued him, and followed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "close upon him, although he was not near enough to strike him with his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "sword. Thereupon Owain descried a vast and resplendent castle. And they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "came to the castle-gate. And the black knight was allowed to enter,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and the portcullis was let fall upon Owain; and it struck his horse\r\n",
      "\n",
      "behind the saddle, and cut him in two and carried away the rowels of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the spurs that were upon Owain's heels. And the portcullis descended\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to the floor. And the rowels of the spurs and part of the horse were\r\n",
      "\n",
      "without; and Owain, with the other part of the horse, remained between\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the two gates, and the inner gate was closed, so that Owain could not\r\n",
      "\n",
      "go thence; and Owain was in a perplexing situation. And, while he was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in this state, he could see through an aperture in the gate a street\r\n",
      "\n",
      "facing him, with a row of houses on each side. And he beheld a maiden,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with yellow curling hair, and a frontlet of gold upon her head; and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "she was clad in a dress of yellow satin, and on her feet were shoes of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "variegated leather. And she approached the gate, and desired that it\r\n",
      "\n",
      "should be opened.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven knows, lady,\" said Owain, \"it is no more possible for me to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "open to thee from hence than it is for thee to set me free.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Truly,\" said the damsel, \"it is very sad that thou canst not be\r\n",

      "released, and every woman ought to succor thee; for I never saw one\r\n",
      "\n",
      "more faithful in the service of ladies than thou. As a friend thou art\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the most sincere, and as a lover the most devoted. Therefore,\" quoth\r\n",
      "\n",
      "she, \"whatever is in my power to do for thy release, I will do it. Take\r\n",
      "\n",
      "this ring, and put it on thy finger with the stone inside thy hand, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "close thy hand upon the stone. And as long as thou concealest it it\r\n",
      "\n",
      "will conceal thee. When they have consulted together, they will come\r\n",
      "\n",
      "forth to fetch thee in order to put thee to death; and they will be\r\n",
      "\n",
      "much grieved that they cannot find thee. And I will await thee on the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horseblock yonder; and thou wilt be able to see me, though I cannot\r\n",
      "\n",
      "see thee: therefore come and place thy hand upon my shoulder, that I\r\n",
      "\n",
      "may know that thou art near me. And by the way that I go hence do thou\r\n",

      "accompany me.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she went away from Owain, and he did all that the maiden had told\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him. And the people of the castle came to seek Owain to put him to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "death; and, when they found nothing but the half of his horse, they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "were sorely grieved.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And Owain vanished from among them, and went to the maiden, and placed\r\n",

      "his hand upon her shoulder; whereupon she set off. And Owain followed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "her until they came to the door of a large and beautiful chamber; and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the maiden opened it, and they went in and closed the door. And Owain\r\n",
      "\n",
      "looked around the chamber; and behold there was not even a single nail\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in it that was not painted with gorgeous colors; and there was not a\r\n",

      "single panel that had not sundry images in gold portrayed upon it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "The maiden kindled a fire, and took water in a silver bowl, and put a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "towel of white linen on her shoulder, and gave Owain water to wash.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she placed before him a silver table inlaid with gold, upon which\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was a cloth of yellow linen, and she brought him food. And of a truth\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Owain had never seen any kind of meat that was not there in abundance;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "but it was better cooked there than he had ever found it in any other\r\n",
      "\n",
      "place. Nor did he ever see so excellent a display of meat and drink\r\n",
      "\n",
      "as there. And there was not one vessel from which he was served that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was not of gold or of silver. And Owain ate and drank until late in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the afternoon, when, lo, they heard a mighty clamor in the castle. And\r\n",

      "And a little after daybreak they heard an exceeding loud clamor and\r\n",

      "\n",
      "And Owain rose up and clothed himself, and opened a window of the\r\n",

      "\n",
      "bounds nor the extent of the hosts that filled the streets. And they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "were fully armed. And a vast number of women were with them, both on\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horseback and on foot; and all the ecclesiastics in the city, singing.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And it seemed to Owain that the sky resounded with the vehemence of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "their cries, and with the noise of the trumpets, and with the singing\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of the ecclesiastics. In the midst of the throng he beheld the bier,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "over which was a veil of white linen; and wax tapers were burning\r\n",
      "\n",
      "beside and around it, and none that supported the bier was lower in\r\n",

      "rank than a powerful baron.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Never did Owain see an assemblage so gorgeous with satin and silk and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "sendal. And following the train he beheld a lady, with yellow hair\r\n",
      "\n",
      "falling over her shoulders, and stained with blood, and about her a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "dress of yellow satin, which was torn. Upon her feet were shoes of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "variegated leather. And it was a marvel that the ends of her fingers\r\n",
      "\n",
      "were not bruised, from the violence with which she smote her hands\r\n",
      "\n",
      "together. Truly she would have been the fairest lady Owain ever saw,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "had she been in her usual guise. And her cry was louder than the shout\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of the men or the clamor of the trumpets. No sooner had he beheld the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "lady than he became inflamed with her love, so that it took entire\r\n",
      "\n",
      "possession of him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven knows,\" replied the maiden, \"she may be said to be the fairest,\r\n",

      "and the most chaste, and the most liberal, and the wisest, and the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "most noble, of women; and she is my mistress. And she is called the\r\n",

      "water and placed it to warm; and she brought a towel of white linen\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and placed it around Owain's neck; and she took a goblet of ivory and\r\n",

      "whose haft was of ivory, and upon which were two rivets of gold. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "she shaved his beard and she dried his head and his throat with the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "towel. Then she rose up from before Owain, and brought him to eat. And\r\n",

      "\n",
      "nothing but mourning and sorrow; and the countess in her chamber could\r\n",
      "\n",
      "not bear the sight of any one through grief. Luned came and saluted\r\n",
      "\n",
      "her; but the countess answered her not. And the maiden bent down\r\n",

      "\n",
      "having made thee rich--it was wrong in thee that thou didst not come to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "see me in my distress. That was wrong in thee. As it is, I will banish\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Luned set out, under the pretence of going to Arthur's court; but she\r\n",

      "\n",
      "there with him as long as it might have taken her to have travelled to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the court of King Arthur. And at the end of that time she apparelled\r\n",
      "\n",
      "herself, and went to visit the countess. And the countess was much\r\n",
      "\n",
      "rejoiced when she saw her, and inquired what news she brought from the\r\n",

      "\n",
      "cut him in two. And he dried his sword, and went on his way as before.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "But, behold, the lion followed him and played about him as though it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "it was time for Owain to take his rest he dismounted, and turned his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse loose in a flat and wooded meadow. And he struck fire, and when\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the fire was kindled the lion brought him fuel enough to last for three\r\n",
      "\n",
      "nights. And the lion disappeared. And presently the lion returned,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "bearing a fine large roebuck. And he threw it down before Owain, who\r\n",

      "went towards the fire with it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "flesh upon skewers around the fire. The rest of the buck he gave to the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "lion to devour. While he was doing this, he heard a deep sigh near him,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and a second, and a third. And Owain called out to know whether the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "sigh he heard proceeded from a mortal, and he received answer that it\r\n",
      "\n",
      "did.\r\n",

      "not returned since. And he was the friend I loved best in the world.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And two of the pages in the countess' chamber traduced him, and called\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him a deceiver. And I told them that they two were not a match for him\r\n",
      "\n",
      "alone. So they imprisoned me in the stone vault, and said that I should\r\n",

      "be put to death unless he came himself to deliver me by a certain day;\r\n",

      "and that is no further off than the day after to-morrow. And I have\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "And his horse was well cared for, and plenty of fodder was placed\r\n",

      "before him. Then the lion went and laid down in the horse's manger;\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "by the coming of the giant with the two youths. And the earl was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "anxious both to protect his castle, and to release his two sons. Then\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Owain put on his armor, and went forth to encounter the giant. And the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "lion followed him. And, when the giant saw that Owain was armed, he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "rushed towards him and attacked him. And the lion fought with the giant\r\n",

      "upon him; and then he returned to fight the giant as before. And the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "lion roared very loud, for he heard that it went hard with Owain. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he climbed up till he reached the top of the earl's hall, and thence he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "got to the top of the castle; and he sprang down from the walls, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "went and joined Owain. And the lion gave the giant a stroke with his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "paw which tore him from his shoulder to his hip, and his heart was laid\r\n",
      "\n",
      "bare. And the giant fell down dead. Then Owain restored the two youths\r\n",

      "forward towards the meadow where Luned was. And when he came there he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "saw a great fire kindled, and two youths with beautiful curling auburn\r\n",
      "\n",
      "hair were leading the maiden to cast her into the fire. And Owain asked\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "the lion came to Owain's assistance, and they two got the better of the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "imprisoned, and blocked up the door with stones; and he went to fight\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with the young men as before. But Owain had not his usual strength, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the two youths pressed hard upon him. And the lion roared incessantly\r\n",
      "\n",
      "at seeing Owain in trouble. And he burst through the wall until he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "found a way out, and rushed upon the young men, and instantly slew\r\n",

      "\n",
      "upon her face, and upon her stomacher, and gave her a violent blow on\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the face, and said, \"If any have the boldness to dispute this goblet\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "such powers, through magic or charms, that none could be able to take\r\n",

      "bony piebald horse with the uncouth trappings upon it, and in this way\r\n",
      "\n",

      "Arthur and all his household, to call out, and declare such a man as\r\n",
      "\n",
      "this the chief of warriors and the flower of knighthood.\" And he gave\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him such a box on the ear that he fell senseless to the ground.\r\n",

      "And the old man was lame. Peredur rode to the palace; and the door\r\n",

      "sitting on a cushion, and a large blazing fire burning before him. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the household and the company arose to meet Peredur, and disarrayed\r\n",

      "\n",
      "down and conversed together. When it was time, the tables were laid,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and they went to meat. And when they had finished their meal, the man\r\n",

      "he lifted up his arm, and struck him such a mighty blow that his brow\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, my life,\" said the man, \"come now, and sit down; for thou wilt\r\n",

      "desert wood, and at the further end of the wood was a meadow, and on\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the other side of the meadow he saw a large castle. And thitherward\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Peredur bent his way, and he found the gate open, and he proceeded\r\n",

      "\n",
      "when they had eaten and drunk as much as they desired, the nobleman\r\n",

      "put her arms about his neck, and made him sit down beside her. Not long\r\n",

      "\n",
      "level meadows. And on one side of the river he saw a flock of white\r\n",

      "white; and, when one of the black sheep bleated, one of the white sheep\r\n",

      "of the river, one half of which was in flames from the root to the\r\n",

      "top, and the other half was green and in full leaf. And nigh thereto he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "saw a youth sitting upon a mound, and two greyhounds, white-breasted\r\n",

      "and spotted, in leashes, lying by his side. And certain was he that he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "had never seen a youth of so royal a bearing as he. And in the wood\r\n",
      "\n",
      "opposite he heard hounds raising a herd of deer. And Peredur saluted\r\n",

      "roads leading from the mound: two of them were wide roads, and the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "Addanc, and he pierced him through with his lance, and cut off his\r\n",

      "\n",
      "at the entrance; and they saluted Peredur, and told him that there was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "a prediction that he should slay that monster. And Peredur gave the\r\n",
      "\n",

      "man upon a red horse, with red armor upon him. And the man rode up by\r\n",

      "absence, and wondered no more at his coming than usual. And that day\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was spent in joy and merriment; and he sat and conversed with his wife\r\n",

      "during the past year, compared with what it had been before.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord,\" said they, \"thy wisdom was never so great, and thou wast never\r\n",

      "so kind or so free in bestowing thy gifts; and thy justice was never\r\n",

      "\n",
      "said they, \"render thanks unto Heaven that thou hast such a fellowship,\r\n",

      "and each sent unto the other horses and greyhounds and hawks, and all\r\n",
      "\n",
      "such jewels as they thought would be pleasing to each other. And by\r\n",
      "\n",
      "reason of his having dwelt that year in Annwvyn, and having ruled there\r\n",
      "\n",
      "so prosperously, and united the two kingdoms in one day by his valor\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and prowess, he lost the name of Pwyll, Prince of Dyved, and was called\r\n",

      "\n",
      "after the first meal, Pwyll arose to walk, and he went to the top of a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "mound that was above the palace, and was called Gorsedd Arberth.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Lord,\" said one of the court, \"it is peculiar to the mound that\r\n",

      "whosoever sits upon it cannot go thence without either receiving wounds\r\n",
      "\n",
      "or blows, or else seeing a wonder.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I fear not to receive wounds and blows in the midst of such a host as\r\n",

      "this; but as to the wonder, gladly would I see it. I will go therefore\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and sit upon the mound.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And upon the mound he sat. And while he sat there, they saw a lady, on\r\n",
      "\n",
      "a pure white horse of large size, with a garment of shining gold around\r\n",
      "\n",
      "her, coming along the highway that led from the mound; and the horse\r\n",
      "\n",
      "seemed to move at a slow and even pace, and to be coming up towards the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "mound.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My men,\" said Pwyll, \"is there any among you who knows yonder lady?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is not, lord,\" said they.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go one of you and meet her, that we may know who she is.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And one of them arose; and as he came upon the road to meet her she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "passed by, and he followed as fast as he could, being on foot; and the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "greater was his speed, the farther was she from him. And when he saw\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that it profited him nothing to follow her, he returned to Pwyll, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "said unto him, \"Lord, it is idle for any one in the world to follow her\r\n",
      "\n",
      "on foot.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Verily,\" said Pwyll, \"go unto the palace, and take the fleetest horse\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that thou seest, and go after her.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And he took a horse and went forward. And he came to an open level\r\n",
      "\n",
      "plain, and put spurs to his horse; and the more he urged his horse,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the farther was she from him. Yet she held the same pace as at first.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And his horse began to fail; and when his horse's feet failed him, he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "returned to the place where Pwyll was.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord,\" said he, \"it will avail nothing for any one to follow yonder\r\n",
      "\n",
      "lady. I know of no horse in these realms swifter than this, and it\r\n",
      "\n",
      "availed me not to pursue her.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of a truth,\" said Pwyll, \"there must be some illusion here. Let us go\r\n",
      "\n",
      "towards the palace.\" So to the palace they went, and they spent that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "day. And the next day they arose, and that also they spent until it was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "time to go to meat. And after the first meal, \"Verily,\" said Pwyll, \"we\r\n",
      "\n",
      "will go, the same party as yesterday, to the top of the mound. And do\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou,\" said he to one of his young men, \"take the swiftest horse that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou knowest in the field.\" And thus did the young man. And they went\r\n",
      "\n",
      "towards the mound, taking the horse with them. And as they were sitting\r\n",
      "\n",
      "down they beheld the lady on the same horse, and in the same apparel,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "coming along the same road. \"Behold,\" said Pwyll, \"here is the lady of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "yesterday. Make ready, youth, to learn who she is.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My lord,\" said he, \"that will I gladly do.\" And thereupon the lady\r\n",
      "\n",
      "came opposite to them. So the youth mounted his horse; and before he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "had settled himself in his saddle, she passed by, and there was a clear\r\n",
      "\n",
      "space between them. But her speed was no greater than it had been the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "day before. Then he put his horse into an amble, and thought, that,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "notwithstanding the gentle pace at which his horse went, he should soon\r\n",
      "\n",
      "overtake her. But this availed him not: so he gave his horse the reins.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And still he came no nearer to her than when he went at a foot's pace.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And the more he urged his horse, the farther was she from him. Yet she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "rode not faster than before. When he saw that it availed not to follow\r\n",
      "\n",
      "her, he returned to the place where Pwyll was. \"Lord,\" said he, \"the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse can no more than thou hast seen.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see indeed that it avails not that any one should follow her. And by\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Heaven,\" said he, \"she must needs have an errand to some one in this\r\n",
      "\n",
      "plain, if her haste would allow her to declare it. Let us go back to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the palace.\" And to the palace they went, and they spent that night in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "songs and feasting, as it pleased them.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And the next day they amused themselves until it was time to go to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "meat. And when meat was ended, Pwyll said, \"Where are the hosts that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "went yesterday and the day before to the top of the mound?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Behold, lord, we are here,\" said they.\r\n",

      "\"Let us go,\" said he, \"to the mound, to sit there. And do thou,\" said\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he to the page who tended his horse, \"saddle my horse well, and hasten\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with him to the road, and bring also my spurs with thee.\" And the youth\r\n",
      "\n",
      "did thus. And they went and sat upon the mound. And ere they had been\r\n",
      "\n",
      "there but a short time, they beheld the lady coming by the same road,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and in the same manner, and at the same pace. \"Young man,\" said Pwyll,\r\n",
      "\n",

      "his own possessions.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "for them also of the palace, and they went to the tables and sat down.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And as they had sat that time twelvemonth, so sat they that night. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they ate, and feasted, and spent the night in mirth and tranquillity.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And next morning, at the break of day, \"My lord,\" said Rhiannon, \"arise\r\n",

      "\n",
      "be proclaimed, and desired all the suitors and the minstrels to show\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and to point out what gifts were to their wish and desire. And this\r\n",
      "\n",

      "of the land, and of these there was none to whom Rhiannon did not give\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "she should remain in that palace of Narberth until the end of seven\r\n",

      "years, and that she should sit every day near unto a horseblock that\r\n",

      "permit her, to carry them upon her back into the palace. But it rarely\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Now at that time Teirnyon Twryv Vliant was lord of Gwent Is Coed, and\r\n",

      "\n",
      "a mare than which neither mare nor horse in the kingdom was more\r\n",

      "beautiful. And on the night of every first of May she foaled, and no\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "heard a great tumult, and after the tumult behold a claw came through\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the window into the house, and it seized the colt by the mane. Then\r\n",

      "\n",
      "not see the cause of the tumult because of the darkness of the night;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "but he rushed after it and followed it. Then he remembered that he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "had left the door open, and he returned. And at the door behold there\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was an infant-boy in swaddling-clothes, wrapped around in a mantle of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "satin. And he took up the boy, and behold he was very strong for the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "age that he was of.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\"He is then a boy of gentle lineage,\" she replied.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And they caused the boy to be baptized, and the ceremony was performed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "there. And the name which they gave unto him was Gwri Wallt Euryn,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "because what hair was upon his head was as yellow as gold. And they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "had the boy nursed in the court until he was a year old. And before\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the year was over he could walk stoutly; and he was larger than a boy\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of three years old, even one of great growth and size. And the boy was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "nursed the second year, and then he was as large as a child six years\r\n",
      "\n",
      "old. And before the end of the fourth year, he would bribe the grooms\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to allow him to take the horses to water.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My lord,\" said his wife unto Teirnyon, \"where is the colt which thou\r\n",

      "didst save on the night that thou didst find the boy?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Would it not be well, lord,\" said she, \"if thou wert to cause him to\r\n",

      "be broken in, and given to the boy, seeing that on the same night that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou didst find the boy, the colt was foaled, and thou didst save him?\"\r\n",
      "\n",

      "horse was given to the boy. Then she went to the grooms and those who\r\n",
      "\n",
      "tended the horses, and commanded them to be careful of the horse, so\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that he might be broken in by the time that the boy could ride him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And while these things were going forward, they heard tidings of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Rhiannon and her punishment. And Teirnyon Twryv Vliant, by reason\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of the pity that he felt on hearing this story of Rhiannon and her\r\n",
      "\n",
      "punishment, inquired closely concerning it, until he had heard from\r\n",
      "\n",
      "many of those who came to his court. Then did Teirnyon, often lamenting\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the sad history, ponder within himself; and he looked steadfastly\r\n",
      "\n",
      "on the boy, and as he looked upon him, it seemed to him that he had\r\n",
      "\n",
      "never beheld so great a likeness between father and son as between the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "boy and Pwyll the chief of Annwvyn. Now the semblance of Pwyll was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "well known to him, for he had of yore been one of his followers. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thereupon he became grieved for the wrong that he did in keeping with\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him a boy whom he knew to be the son of another man. And the first time\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that he was alone with his wife he told her that it was not right that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they should keep the boy with them, and suffer so excellent a lady as\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Rhiannon to be punished so greatly on his account, whereas the boy was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the son of Pwyll the chief of Annwvyn. And Teirnyon's wife agreed with\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him that they should send the boy to Pwyll. \"And three things, lord,\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "said she, \"shall we gain thereby,--thanks and gifts for releasing\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Rhiannon from her punishment, and thanks from Pwyll for nursing his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "son and restoring him unto him; and, thirdly, if the boy is of gentle\r\n",
      "\n",
      "nature, he will be our foster-son, and he will do for us all the good\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in his power.\" So it was settled according to this counsel.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And no later than the next day was Teirnyon equipped and two other\r\n",
      "\n",
      "knights with him. And the boy, as a fourth in their company, went with\r\n",
      "\n",
      "them upon the horse which Teirnyon had given him. And they journeyed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "towards Narberth, and it was not long before they reached that place.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And as they drew near to the palace, they beheld Rhiannon sitting\r\n",
      "\n",
      "beside the horseblock. And when they were opposite to her, \"Chieftain,\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "said she, \"go not farther thus: I will bear every one of you into the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "palace. And this is my penance for slaying my own son, and devouring\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\"Truly, my soul,\" said Teirnyon, \"we will not go.\" So they went forward\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to the palace, and there was great joy at their coming. And at the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "palace a feast was prepared, because Pwyll was come back from the\r\n",

      "confines of Dyved. And they went into the hall and washed, and Pwyll\r\n",

      "Pwyll and Rhiannon, and Teirnyon's two companions on the other side\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of Pwyll, with the boy between them. And after meat they began to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "carouse and to discourse. And Teirnyon's discourse was concerning the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "adventure of the mare and the boy, and how he and his wife had nursed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and reared the child as their own. \"And behold here is thy son, lady,\"\r\n",

      "Lloegyr, and seek some craft whereby we may gain our support.\" So\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they went into Lloegyr, and came as far as Hereford. And they betook\r\n",
      "\n",
      "themselves to making saddles. And Manawyddan began to make housings;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and he gilded and colored them with blue enamel in the manner that he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "had seen it done by Llasar Llaesgywydd. And he made the blue enamel as\r\n",
      "\n",
      "it was made by the other man. And therefore is it still called Calch\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Lasar [blue enamel], because Llasar Llaesgywydd had wrought it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And as long as that workmanship could be had of Manawyddan, neither\r\n",
      "\n",
      "saddle nor housing was bought of a saddler throughout all Hereford;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "till at length every one of the saddlers perceived that they were\r\n",
      "\n",
      "losing much of their gain, and that no man bought of them but him who\r\n",
      "\n",
      "could not get what he sought from Manawyddan. Then they assembled\r\n",
      "\n",
      "together, and agreed to slay him and his companions.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Now they received warning of this, and took counsel whether they should\r\n",
      "\n",
      "leave the city. \"By Heaven,\" said Pryderi, \"it is not my counsel that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "we should quit the town, but that we should slay these boors.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so,\" said Manawyddan; \"for, if we fight with them, we shall have\r\n",
      "\n",
      "evil fame, and shall be put in prison. It were better for us to go to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "another town to maintain ourselves.\" So they four went to another city.\r\n",

      "\n",
      "fashioned them after the shape of the good shields they had seen; and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they enamelled them, as they had done the saddles. And they prospered\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in that place, so that not a shield was asked for in the whole town,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "but such as was had of them. Rapid therefore was their work, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "numberless were the shields they made. But at last they were marked by\r\n",

      "the craftsmen, who came together in haste, and their fellow-townsmen\r\n",

      "\n",
      "destruction. \"Pryderi,\" said Manawyddan, \"these men desire to slay us.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us not endure this from these boors, but let us rather fall upon\r\n",

      "them and slay them.\"\r\n",

      "to make clasps for the shoes, and to gild the clasps; and he marked how\r\n",

      "\n",
      "And when the men came up, he fell back a second time, and betook him to\r\n",

      "in the evening, being certain that he should have no tidings of Pryderi\r\n",

      "that Gwenhwyvar did not awake, and did not move in her bed; and the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "attendants wished to awaken her. \"Disturb her not,\" said Arthur, \"for\r\n",
      "\n",
      "she had rather sleep than go to see the hunting.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Arthur went forth; and he heard two horns sounding, one from near\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the lodging of the chief huntsman, and the other from near that of the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "chief page. And the whole assembly of the multitudes came to Arthur,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and they took the road to the forest.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And after Arthur had gone forth from the palace, Gwenhwyvar awoke,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and called to her maidens, and apparelled herself. \"Maidens,\" said\r\n",
      "\n",
      "she, \"I had leave last night to go and see the hunt. Go one of you\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to the stable, and order hither a horse such as a woman may ride.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And one of them went, and she found but two horses in the stable; and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Gwenhwyvar and one of her maidens mounted them, and went through the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Usk, and followed the track of the men and the horses. And as they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "rode thus, they heard a loud and rushing sound; and they looked behind\r\n",
      "\n",
      "them, and beheld a knight upon a hunter-foal of mighty size; and the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "rider was a fair-haired youth, bare-legged, and of princely mien, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "a golden-hilted sword was at his side, and a robe and a surcoat of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "satin were upon him, and two low shoes of leather upon his feet, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "around him was a scarf of blue purple, at each corner of which was a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "golden apple. And his horse stepped stately and swift and proud; and he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "overtook Gwenhwyvar, and saluted her. \"Heaven prosper thee, Geraint,\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "said she: \"I knew thee when first I saw thee just now. And the welcome\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of Heaven be unto thee. And why didst thou not go with thy lord to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "hunt?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I knew not when he went,\" said he.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I marvel too,\" said she, \"how he could go unknown to me.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, lady!\" said he.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was asleep, and knew not when he went. And it may be that I shall\r\n",
      "\n",
      "be more amused with the hunting than they; for we shall hear the horns\r\n",
      "\n",
      "when they sound, and we shall hear the dogs when they are let loose,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and begin to cry.\" So they went to the edge of the forest, and there\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they stood. \"From this place,\" said she, \"we shall hear when the dogs\r\n",
      "\n",
      "are let loose.\" And thereupon they heard a loud noise, and they looked\r\n",
      "\n",
      "towards the spot whence it came, and they beheld a dwarf riding upon\r\n",
      "\n",
      "a horse, stately, and foaming and prancing, and strong and spirited.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the hand of the dwarf was a whip. And near the dwarf they saw a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "lady upon a beautiful white horse of steady and stately pace; and she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was clothed in a garment of gold brocade. And near her was a knight\r\n",
      "\n",
      "upon a war-horse of large size, with heavy and bright armor both upon\r\n",
      "\n",
      "himself and upon his horse. And truly they never before saw a knight,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "or a horse, or armor, of such remarkable size. And they were all near\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to each other.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Geraint,\" said Gwenhwyvar, \"knowest thou the name of that tall knight\r\n",

      "yonder?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know him not,\" said he; \"and the strange armor that he wears\r\n",
      "\n",
      "prevents my either seeing his face or his features.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go, maiden,\" said Gwenhwyvar, \"and ask the dwarf who that knight is.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the maiden went up to the dwarf; and the dwarf waited for the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "maiden when he saw her coming towards him. And the maiden inquired of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the dwarf who the knight was.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will not tell thee,\" he answered.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since thou art so churlish as not to tell me,\" said she, \"I will ask\r\n",

      "him himself.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou shalt not ask him, by my faith!\" said he.\r\n",

      "\"Wherefore?\" said she.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because thou art not of honor sufficient to befit thee to speak to my\r\n",
      "\n",
      "lord.\" Then the maiden turned her horse's head towards the knight, upon\r\n",
      "\n",
      "which the dwarf struck her, with the whip that was in his hand, across\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the face and the eyes, until the blood flowed forth. And the maiden,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "through the hurt she received from the blow, returned to Gwenhwyvar,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "complaining of the pain.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very rudely has the dwarf treated thee,\" said Geraint. \"I will go\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That wilt thou not, by my faith!\" said the dwarf. \"Thou art not\r\n",

      "honorable enough to speak with my lord.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Said Geraint, \"I have spoken with men of equal rank with him.\" And he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "turned his horse's head towards the knight; but the dwarf overtook him,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and struck him as he had done the maiden, so that the blood colored the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "scarf that Geraint wore. Then Geraint put his hand upon the hilt of his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "sword; but he took counsel with himself, and considered that it would\r\n",
      "\n",
      "be no vengeance for him to slay the dwarf, and to be attacked unarmed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "by the armed knight: so he returned to where Gwenhwyvar was.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou hast acted wisely and discreetly,\" said she.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lady,\" said he, \"I will follow him yet, with thy permission; and at\r\n",
      "\n",
      "last he will come to some inhabited place, where I may have arms either\r\n",
      "\n",
      "as a loan or for a pledge, so that I may encounter the knight.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go,\" said she, \"and do not attack him until thou hast good arms; and I\r\n",

      "shall be very anxious concerning thee until I hear tidings of thee.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I am alive,\" said he, \"thou shalt hear tidings of me by to-morrow\r\n",

      "afternoon.\" And with that he departed.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And the road they took was below the palace of Caerlleon, and across\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the ford of the Usk. And they went along a fair and even and lofty\r\n",
      "\n",
      "ridge of ground until they came to a town, and at the extremity of the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "town they saw a fortress and a castle. And they came to the extremity\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of the town. And as the knight passed through it, all the people arose\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and saluted him, and bade him welcome. And when Geraint came into the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "town, he looked at every house to see if he knew any of those whom he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "saw. But he knew none, and none knew him to do him the kindness to let\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him have arms either as a loan or for a pledge. And every house he saw\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was full of men and arms and horses. And they were polishing shields,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and burnishing swords, and washing armor, and shoeing horses. And the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "knight and the lady and the dwarf rode up to the castle that was in the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "town, and every one was glad in the castle. And from the battlements\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and the gates they risked their necks through their eagerness to greet\r\n",
      "\n",
      "them, and to show their joy.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint stood there to see whether the knight would remain in the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "castle. And when he was certain that he would do so, he looked around\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him; and at a little distance from the town he saw an old palace in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "ruins, wherein was a hall that was falling to decay. And as he knew not\r\n",
      "\n",
      "any one in the town, he went towards the old palace; and when he came\r\n",
      "\n",
      "near to the palace he saw but one chamber, and a bridge of marble-stone\r\n",
      "\n",
      "leading to it. And upon the bridge he saw sitting a hoary-headed man,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "upon whom were tattered garments. And Geraint gazed steadfastly upon\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him for a long time. Then the hoary-headed man spoke to him. \"Young\r\n",
      "\n",
      "man,\" he said, \"wherefore art thou thoughtful?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am thoughtful,\" said he, \"because I know not where to go to-night.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wilt thou come forward this way, chieftain?\" said he, \"and thou shalt\r\n",
      "\n",
      "have the best that can be procured for thee.\" So Geraint went forward.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And the hoary-headed man preceded him into the hall. And in the hall he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "dismounted, and he left there his horse. Then he went on to the upper\r\n",
      "\n",
      "chamber with the hoary-headed man. And in the chamber he beheld an old\r\n",
      "\n",
      "decrepit woman sitting on a cushion, with old, tattered garments of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "satin upon her; and it seemed to him that he had never seen a woman\r\n",
      "\n",
      "fairer than she must have been when in the fulness of youth. And beside\r\n",
      "\n",
      "her was a maiden, upon whom were a vest and a veil that were old, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "beginning to be worn out. And truly he never saw a maiden more full of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "comeliness and grace and beauty than she. And the hoary-headed man said\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to the maiden, \"There is no attendant for the horse of this youth but\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thyself.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will render the best service I am able,\" said she, \"both to him\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and to his horse.\" And the maiden disarrayed the youth, and then she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "furnished his horse with straw and with corn. And she went to the hall\r\n",
      "\n",
      "as before, and then she returned to the chamber.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And the hoary-headed man said to the maiden, \"Go to the town,\" said he,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and bring hither the best that thou canst find both of food and of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "liquor.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will gladly, lord,\" said she. And to the town went the maiden. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they conversed together while the maiden was at the town. And behold!\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the maiden came back, and a youth with her, bearing on his back a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "costrel full of good purchased mead, and a quarter of a young bullock.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the hands of the maiden was a quantity of white bread, and she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "had some manchet bread in her veil, and she came into the chamber.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could not obtain better than this,\" said she, \"nor with better\r\n",
      "\n",
      "should I have been trusted.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is good enough,\" said Geraint. And they caused the meat to be\r\n",
      "\n",
      "boiled; and when their food was ready, they sat down. And it was on\r\n",
      "\n",
      "this wise: Geraint sat between the hoary-headed man and his wife, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the maiden served them. And they ate and drank.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they had finished eating, Geraint talked with the hoary-headed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "man; and he asked him, in the first place, to whom belonged the palace\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that he was in.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Truly,\" said he, \"it was I that built it, and to me also belonged the\r\n",

      "city and the castle which thou sawest.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas!\" said Geraint, \"how is it that thou hast lost them now?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I lost a great earldom as well as these,\" said he. \"And this is how\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I lost them. I had a nephew, the son of my brother, and I took his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "possessions to myself; and when he came to his strength, he demanded of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "me his property; but I withheld it from him. So he made war upon me,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and wrested from me all that I possessed.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good sir,\" said Geraint, \"wilt thou tell me wherefore came the knight\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and the lady and the dwarf just now into the town, and what is the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "preparation which I saw and the putting of arms in order?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will do so,\" said he. \"The preparations are for the game that is to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "be held to-morrow by the young earl, which will be on this wise. In the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "midst of a meadow which is here, two forks will be set up, and upon the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "two forks a silver rod, and upon the silver rod a sparrow-hawk; and for\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the sparrow-hawk there will be a tournament. And to the tournament will\r\n",
      "\n",
      "go all the array thou didst see in the city, of men and of horses and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of arms. And with each man will go the lady he loves best; and no man\r\n",
      "\n",
      "can joust for the sparrow-hawk, except the lady he loves best be with\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him. And the knight that thou sawest has gained the sparrow-hawk these\r\n",
      "\n",
      "two years; and if he gains it the third year, they will from that time\r\n",
      "\n",
      "send it every year to him, and he himself will come here no more. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he will be called the Knight of the Sparrow-hawk from that time forth.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" said Geraint, \"what is thy counsel to me concerning this knight,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "on account of the insult which I received from the dwarf, and that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "which was received by the maiden of Gwenhwyvar, the wife of Arthur?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And Geraint told the hoary-headed man what the insult was that he had\r\n",
      "\n",
      "received.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not easy to counsel thee, inasmuch as thou hast neither dame nor\r\n",

      "here which thou couldest have, and there is my horse also, if he seem\r\n",

      "\n",
      "the appointed time shall come to-morrow, thou wilt permit me, sir, to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "challenge for yonder maiden that is thy daughter, I will engage, if I\r\n",

      "a feeble and aged man, and, whilst I was able to maintain the dominion\r\n",
      "\n",
      "for thee and for myself, I did so. But thou art young, and in the\r\n",

      "they were not long in giving, so eager was every one to bestow gifts.\r\n",

      "should come to receive their homage, and whether they had any thing to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "object to him. Then Geraint sent ambassadors to the men of Cornwall\r\n",

      "joy and honor to them for Geraint to come and receive their homage. So\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he received the homage of such as were there. And they remained with\r\n",

      "frequented tournaments. And he became acquainted with valiant and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "mighty men, until he had gained as much fame there as he had formerly\r\n",

      "done elsewhere. And he enriched his court, and his companions, and his\r\n",

      "nobles, with the best horses and the best arms, and with the best and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "most valuable jewels; and he ceased not until his fame had flown over\r\n",

      "the face of the whole kingdom. And when he knew that it was thus, he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "began to love ease and pleasure, for there was no one who was worth\r\n",

      "palace, with minstrelsy and diversions. And for a long time he abode\r\n",
      "\n",
      "at home. And he took no delight in any thing besides, insomuch that he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "gave up the friendship of his nobles, together with his hunting and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "his amusements, and lost the hearts of all the host in his court. And\r\n",

      "companionship for the love of his wife. And these tidings came to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Erbin. And when Erbin had heard these things, he spoke unto Enid, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "inquired of her whether it was she that had caused Geraint to act thus,\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not I, by my confession unto Heaven!\" said she. \"There is nothing\r\n",

      "more hateful to me than this.\" And she knew not what she should do,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "for, although it was hard for her to own this to Geraint, yet was it\r\n",
      "\n",
      "not more easy for her to listen to what she heard, without warning\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint concerning it. And she was very sorrowful.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And one morning in the summer time, Enid was without sleep in the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "apartment which had windows of glass. And the sun shone upon the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "couch. And the clothes had slipped from off his arms and his breast,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and he was asleep. Then she gazed upon the marvellous beauty of his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "appearance, and she said, \"Alas! and am I the cause that these arms\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and this breast have lost their glory and the warlike fame which they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "once so richly enjoyed?\" And as she said this, the tears dropped from\r\n",
      "\n",
      "her eyes, and they fell upon his breast. And the tears she shed, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the words she had spoken, awoke him. And another thing contributed to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "awaken him, and that was the idea that it was not in thinking of him\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that she spoke thus, but that it was because she loved some other man\r\n",
      "\n",
      "more than him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "squire. And when he came to him, \"Go quickly,\" said he \"and prepare my\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse and my arms, and make them ready.--And do thou arise,\" said he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to Enid, \"and apparel thyself; and cause thy horse to be accoutred,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and clothe thee in the worst riding-dress that thou hast in thy\r\n",
      "\n",
      "possession. And evil betide me,\" said he, \"if thou returnest here until\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou knowest whether I have lost my strength so completely as thou\r\n",
      "\n",
      "didst say. And if it be so, it will then be easy for thee to seek the\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Geraint went to see Erbin. \"Sir,\" said he, \"I am going upon a\r\n",

      "quest, and I am not certain when I may come back. Take heed, therefore,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "unto thy possessions, until my return.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will do so,\" said he; \"but it is strange to me that thou shouldest\r\n",

      "go so suddenly. And who will proceed with thee, since thou art not\r\n",
      "\n",
      "strong enough to traverse the land of Lloegyr alone?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But one person only will go with me.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "themselves to thee in Lloegyr!\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then went Geraint to the place where his horse was, and it was equipped\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with foreign armor, heavy and shining. And he desired Enid to mount her\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse, and to ride forward, and to keep a long way before him. \"And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "whatever thou mayest see, and whatever thou mayest hear concerning me,\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "said he, \"do thou not turn back. And unless I speak unto thee, say not\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou one word, either.\" And they set forward. And he did not choose the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "pleasantest and most frequented road, but that which was the wildest,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and most beset by thieves and robbers, and venomous animals. And they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "came to a high road, which they followed till they saw a vast forest;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and they went towards it, and they saw four armed horsemen come forth\r\n",
      "\n",
      "from the forest.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "When the horsemen had beheld them, one of them said to the others,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Behold, here is a good occasion for us to capture two horses and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "armor, and a lady likewise; for this we shall have no difficulty in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "doing against yonder single knight, who hangs his head so pensively and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "heavily.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And Enid heard this discourse, and she knew not what she should do\r\n",
      "\n",
      "through fear of Geraint, who had told her to be silent. \"The vengeance\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of Heaven be upon me,\" she said, \"if I would not rather receive my\r\n",
      "\n",
      "death from his hand than from the hand of any other! And though he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "should slay me, yet will I speak to him, lest I should have the misery\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to witness his death.\" So she waited for Geraint until he came near\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to her. \"Lord,\" said she, \"didst thou hear the words of those men\r\n",
      "\n",
      "concerning thee?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he lifted up his eyes, and looked at her angrily. \"Thou hadst\r\n",
      "\n",
      "only,\" said he, \"to hold thy peace as I bade thee. I wish but for\r\n",
      "\n",
      "silence, and not for warning. And though thou shouldest desire to see\r\n",
      "\n",
      "my defeat and my death by the hands of those men, yet do I feel no\r\n",
      "\n",
      "dread.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the foremost of them couched his lance, and rushed upon Geraint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And he received him, and that not feebly. But he let the thrust go by\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him, while he struck the horseman upon the centre of his shield in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "such a manner that his shield was split, and his armor broken, and so\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that a cubit's length of the shaft of Geraint's lance passed through\r\n",
      "\n",
      "his body, and sent him to the earth the length of the lance over his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse's crupper. Then the second horseman attacked him furiously,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "being wroth at the death of his companion. But with one thrust Geraint\r\n",
      "\n",
      "overthrew him also, and killed him as he had done the other. Then the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "third set upon him, and he killed him in like manner. And thus also he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "slew the fourth. Sad and sorrowful was the maiden as she saw all this.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint dismounted from his horse, and took the arms of the men he had\r\n",
      "\n",
      "slain, and placed them upon their saddles, and tied together the reins\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of their horses, and he mounted his horse again. \"Behold, what thou\r\n",
      "\n",
      "must do,\" said he; \"take the four horses, and drive them before thee,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and proceed forward, as I bade thee just now. And say not one word unto\r\n",
      "\n",
      "me, unless I speak first unto thee. And I declare unto Heaven,\" said\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he, \"if thou doest not thus, it will be to thy cost.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will do, as far as I can, lord,\" said she, \"according to thy desire.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they went forward through the forest; and when they left the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "forest, they came to a vast plain, in the centre of which was a group\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of thickly tangled copse-wood; and from out thereof they beheld three\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horsemen coming towards them, well equipped with armor, both they and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "their horses. Then the maiden looked steadfastly upon them; and when\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they had come near, she heard them say one to another, \"Behold, here\r\n",
      "\n",
      "is a good arrival for us: here are coming for us four horses and four\r\n",
      "\n",
      "suits of armor. We shall easily obtain them, spite of yonder dolorous\r\n",
      "\n",
      "knight, and the maiden also will fall into our power.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is but too true,\" said she to herself; \"for my husband is tired\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with his former combat. The vengeance of Heaven will be upon me unless\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I warn him of this.\" So the maiden waited until Geraint came up to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "her. \"Lord,\" said she, \"dost thou not hear the discourse of yonder men\r\n",
      "\n",
      "concerning thee?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was it?\" asked he.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They say to one another, that they will easily obtain all this spoil.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare to Heaven,\" he answered, \"that their words are less grievous\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to me than that thou wilt not be silent, and abide by my counsel.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My lord,\" said she, \"I feared lest they should surprise thee unawares.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold thy peace, then!\" said he. \"Do not I desire silence?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And thereupon one of the horsemen couched his lance, and attacked\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint. And he made a thrust at him which he thought would be very\r\n",
      "\n",
      "effective. But Geraint received it carelessly, and struck it aside; and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "then he rushed upon him, and aimed at the centre of his person, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "from the shock of man and horse the quantity of his armor did not avail\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him, and the head of the lance and part of the shaft passed through\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him, so that he was carried to the ground an arm and a spear's length\r\n",
      "\n",
      "over the crupper of his horse. And both the other horsemen came forward\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in their turn; but their onset was not more successful than that of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "their companion. And the maiden stood by, looking at all this; and on\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the one hand she was in trouble lest Geraint should be wounded in his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "encounter with the men, and on the other hand she was joyful to see him\r\n",
      "\n",
      "victorious. Then Geraint dismounted, and bound the three suits of armor\r\n",
      "\n",
      "upon the three saddles, and he fastened the reins of all the horses\r\n",
      "\n",
      "together, so that he had seven horses with him. And he mounted his own\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse, and commanded the maiden to drive forward the others. \"It is no\r\n",
      "\n",
      "more use for me to speak to thee than to refrain; for thou wilt not\r\n",
      "\n",
      "attend to my advice.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will do so, as far as I am able, lord,\" said she; \"but I cannot\r\n",
      "\n",
      "conceal from thee the fierce and threatening words which I may hear\r\n",
      "\n",
      "against thee, lord, from such strange people as those that haunt this\r\n",

      "wilderness.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare to Heaven,\" said he, \"that I desire nought but silence:\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will, lord, while I can.\" And the maiden went on with the horses\r\n",

      "copse-wood already mentioned they journeyed over a vast and dreary open\r\n",
      "\n",
      "plain. And at a great distance from them they beheld a wood, and they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "could see neither end nor boundary to the wood, except on that side\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that was nearest to them, and they went towards it. Then there came\r\n",
      "\n",
      "from out the wood five horsemen, eager and bold, and mighty and strong,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "mounted upon chargers that were powerful, and large of bone, and high\r\n",
      "\n",
      "mettled, and proudly snorting; and both the men and the horses were\r\n",
      "\n",
      "well equipped with arms. And when they drew near to them, Enid heard\r\n",
      "\n",
      "them say, \"Behold, here is a fine booty coming to us, which we shall\r\n",
      "\n",
      "obtain easily and without labor, for we shall have no trouble in taking\r\n",
      "\n",
      "all those horses and arms, and the lady also, from yonder single knight\r\n",
      "\n",
      "so doleful and sad.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorely grieved was the maiden upon hearing this discourse, so that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "she knew not in the world what she should do. At last, however, she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "determined to warn Geraint: so she turned her horse's head towards him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord,\" said she, \"if thou hadst heard as I did what yonder horsemen\r\n",
      "\n",
      "said concerning thee, thy heaviness would be greater than it is.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Angrily and bitterly did Geraint smile upon her, and he said, \"Thee do\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I hear doing every thing that I forbade thee; but it may be that thou\r\n",
      "\n",
      "wilt repent this yet.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And immediately, behold, the men met them; and victoriously and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "gallantly did Geraint overcome them all five. And he placed the five\r\n",
      "\n",
      "suits of armor upon the five saddles, and tied together the reins of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the twelve horses, and gave them in charge to Enid. \"I know not,\" said\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he, \"what good it is for me to order thee; but this time I charge thee\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in an especial manner.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "So the maiden went forward towards the wood, keeping in advance of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint, as he had desired her; and it grieved him as much as his wrath\r\n",
      "\n",
      "would permit to see a maiden so illustrious as she having so much\r\n",
      "\n",
      "trouble with the care of the horses. Then they reached the wood, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "it was both deep and vast; and in the wood night overtook them. \"Ah,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "maiden,\" said he, \"it is vain to attempt proceeding forward!\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It will be best for us,\" he answered, \"to turn out of the wood, and to\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "Having dismounted himself, he took her down from her horse. \"I cannot\r\n",
      "\n",
      "by any means refrain from sleep, through weariness,\" said he. \"Do thou,\r\n",

      "therefore, watch the horses, and sleep not.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will, lord,\" said she. Then he went to sleep in his armor; and thus\r\n",
      "\n",
      "passed the night, which was not long at that season. And when she saw\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the dawn of day appear, she looked around her to see if he were waking,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and thereupon he woke. \"My lord,\" she said, \"I have desired to awake\r\n",

      "thee for some time.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "But he spake nothing to her about fatigue, as he had desired her to be\r\n",
      "\n",
      "silent. Then he arose, and said unto her, \"Take the horses and ride on;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and keep straight on before thee, as thou didst yesterday.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And early in the day they left the wood, and they came to an open\r\n",
      "\n",
      "country, with meadows on one hand, and mowers mowing the meadows. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "there was a river before them, and the horses bent down, and drank the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "water. And they went up out of the river by a lofty steep; and there\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they met a slender stripling, with a satchel about his neck, and they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "saw that there was something in the satchel, but they knew not what it\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was. And he had a small blue pitcher in his hand, and a bowl on the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "mouth of the pitcher. And the youth saluted Geraint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I come,\" said he, \"from the city that lies before thee. My lord,\" he\r\n",

      "also?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By no means. Through yonder wood did I come.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Thou camest not through the wood to-day.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"We were in the wood last night.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I warrant,\" said the youth, \"that thy condition there last night was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "not the most pleasant, and that thou hadst neither meat nor drink.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, by my faith!\" said he.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wilt thou follow my counsel,\" said the youth, \"and take thy meal from\r\n",

      "me?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What sort of meal?\" he inquired.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The breakfast which is sent for yonder mowers; nothing less than bread\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will,\" said he. \"And Heaven reward thee for it!\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "So Geraint alighted, and the youth took the maiden from off her horse.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they washed, and took their repast. And the youth cut the bread in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "slices, and gave them drink, and served them withal.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they had finished, the youth arose, and said to Geraint, \"My\r\n",
      "\n",
      "lord, with thy permission, I will now go and fetch some food for the\r\n",

      "mowers.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go first to the town,\" said Geraint, \"and take a lodging for me in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the best place that thou knowest, and the most commodious one for the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horses, and take thou whichever horse and arms thou choosest in payment\r\n",
      "\n",
      "for thy service and thy gift.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven reward thee, lord!\" said the youth. \"And this would be ample to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "repay services much greater than those I have rendered unto thee.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And to the town went the youth, and he took the best and the most\r\n",
      "\n",
      "pleasant lodgings that he knew; and after that he went to the palace,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "having the horse and armor with him, and proceeded to the place where\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the earl was, and told him all his adventure. \"I go now, lord,\" said\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he, \"to meet the young man, and to conduct him to his lodging.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go gladly,\" said the earl; \"and right joyfully shall he be received\r\n",

      "here, if he so come.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And the youth went to meet Geraint, and told him that he would be\r\n",
      "\n",
      "received gladly by the earl in his own palace, but he would go only\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to his lodgings. And he had a goodly chamber, in which was plenty of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "straw, and drapery, and a spacious and commodious place he had for the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horses; and the youth prepared for them plenty of provender.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And after they had disarrayed themselves, Geraint spoke thus to Enid:\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go,\" said he, \"to the other side of the chamber, and come not to this\r\n",
      "\n",
      "side of the house; and thou mayest call to thee the woman of the house,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "if thou wilt.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will do, lord,\" said she, \"as thou sayest.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And thereupon the man of the house came to Geraint, and welcomed him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O chieftain!\" he said, \"hast thou taken thy meal?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have,\" said he. Then the youth spoke to him, and inquired if he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "would not drink something before he met the earl. \"Truly I will,\" said\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "So the youth went into the town, and brought them drink. And they drank.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must needs sleep,\" said Geraint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the youth. \"And whilst thou sleepest, I will go to see the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "earl.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go gladly,\" he said, \"and come here again when I require thee.\" And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint went to sleep; and so did Enid also.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And the youth came to the place where the earl was, and the earl asked\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him where the lodgings of the knight were, and he told him. \"I must\r\n",
      "\n",
      "go,\" said the youth, \"to wait on him in the evening.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go,\" answered the earl, \"and greet him well from me, and tell him\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that in the evening I will go to see him.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This will I do,\" said the youth. So he came when it was time for them\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to awake. And they arose and went forth. And when it was time for them\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to take their food, they took it. And the youth served them.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And Geraint inquired of the man of the house whether there were any of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "his companions that he wished to invite to him, and he said that there\r\n",
      "\n",
      "were. \"Bring them hither, and entertain them at my cost with the best\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou canst buy in the town.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And the man of the house brought there those whom he chose, and feasted\r\n",
      "\n",
      "them at Geraint's expense. Thereupon, behold the earl came to visit\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint, and his twelve honorable knights with him. And Geraint rose up\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and welcomed him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven preserve thee!\" said the Earl. Then they all sat down according\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to their precedence in honor. And the earl conversed with Geraint, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "inquired of him the object of his journey.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have none,\" he replied, \"but to seek adventures, and to follow my\r\n",
      "\n",
      "own inclination.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the earl cast his eye upon Enid, and he looked at her steadfastly.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And he thought he had never seen a maiden fairer or more comely\r\n",
      "\n",
      "than her. So he arose, and took his leave, and went forth with his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "attendants. And she told not then to Geraint any of the conversation\r\n",
      "\n",
      "which she had had with the earl, lest it should rouse his anger, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "cause him uneasiness and care.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And at the usual hour they went to sleep. And at the beginning of the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "night Enid slept a little; and at midnight she arose, and placed all\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint's armor together, so that it might be ready to put on. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "although fearful of her errand, she came to the side of Geraint's bed;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and she spoke to him softly and gently, saying, \"My lord, arise, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "clothe thyself; for these were the words of the earl to me, and his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "intention concerning me.\" So she told Geraint [that the earl was coming\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with a troop of followers on the morrow to take her away by force].\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And, although he was wroth with her, he took warning, and clothed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "himself. And she lighted a candle, that he might have light to do so.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Leave there the candle,\" said he, \"and desire the man of the house to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "come here.\" Then she went, and the man of the house came to him. \"Dost\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou know how much I owe thee?\" asked Geraint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think thou owest but little.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take the eleven horses and the eleven suits of armor.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven reward thee, lord!\" said he. \"But I spent not the value of one\r\n",
      "\n",
      "suit of armor upon thee.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For that reason,\" said he, \"thou wilt be the richer. And now wilt thou\r\n",
      "\n",
      "come to guide me out of the town?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will gladly,\" said he. \"And in which direction dost thou intend to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "go?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish to leave the town by a different way from that by which I\r\n",
      "\n",
      "entered it.\" So the man of the lodgings accompanied him as far as he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "desired. Then he bade the maiden to go on before him. And she did so,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and went straight forward, and his host returned home. And he had only\r\n",
      "\n",
      "just reached his house, when, behold, the greatest tumult approached\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that was ever heard. And when he looked out, he saw fourscore knights\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in complete armor around the house, with the Earl Dwrm at their head.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is the knight that was here?\" said the earl.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By thy hand,\" said he, \"he went hence some time ago.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wherefore, villain,\" said he, \"didst thou let him go without informing\r\n",

      "me?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And they turned their horses' heads that way, and seeing the tracks\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of the horses upon the high road, they followed. And when the maiden\r\n",
      "\n",
      "beheld the dawning of the day, she looked behind her, and saw vast\r\n",
      "\n",
      "clouds of dust coming nearer and nearer to her. And thereupon she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "became uneasy, and she thought that it was the earl and his host coming\r\n",
      "\n",
      "after them. And thereupon she beheld a knight appearing through the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "mist. \"By my faith!\" said she, \"though he should slay me, it were\r\n",

      "\n",
      "a war-horse strong and large and proudly-stepping and wide-hoofed and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "broad-chested. And he never saw a man of smaller stature than he who\r\n",

      "\n",
      "headlong to the ground; and then they fought on foot, and they gave one\r\n",

      "that their helmets were pierced, and their skullcaps were broken, and\r\n",

      "coming; and they took off her riding-dress, and placed other garments\r\n",
      "\n",
      "upon her. Arthur also called Kadyrieith, and ordered him to pitch a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "tent for Geraint and the physicians; and he enjoined him to provide him\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with abundance of all that might be requisite for him. And Kadyrieith\r\n",
      "\n",
      "did as he had commanded him. And Morgan Tud and his disciples were\r\n",
      "\n",
      "brought to Geraint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And Arthur and his hosts remained there nearly a month, whilst Geraint\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was being healed. And when he was fully recovered, Geraint came to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur, and asked his permission to depart.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know not if thou art quite well.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In truth I am, lord,\" said Geraint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall not believe thee concerning that, but the physicians that were\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with thee.\" So Arthur caused the physicians to be summoned to him, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "asked them if it were true.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is true, lord,\" said Morgan Tud. So the next day Arthur permitted\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him to go forth, and he pursued his journey. And on the same day Arthur\r\n",
      "\n",
      "removed thence.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And Geraint desired Enid to go on, and to keep before him, as she had\r\n",
      "\n",
      "formerly done. And she went forward along the high road. And as they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "journeyed thus, they heard an exceeding loud wailing near to them.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stay thou here,\" said he, \"and I will go and see what is the cause of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "this wailing.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will,\" said she.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he went forward unto an open glade that was near the road. And in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the glade he saw two horses, one having a man's saddle, and the other\r\n",
      "\n",
      "a woman's saddle upon it. And, behold, there was a knight lying dead\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in his armor, and a young damsel in a riding-dress standing over him,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "lamenting. \"Ah, lady!\" said Geraint, \"what hath befallen thee?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Behold,\" she answered, \"I journeyed here with my beloved husband,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "when, lo! three giants came upon us, and without any cause in the world\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they slew him.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which way went they hence?\" said Geraint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yonder by the high road,\" she replied.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "So he returned to Enid. \"Go,\" said he, \"to the lady that is below\r\n",
      "\n",
      "yonder, and await me there till I come.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "She was sad when he ordered her to do thus; but nevertheless she went\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to the damsel, whom it was ruth to hear, and she felt certain that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint would never return. Meanwhile Geraint followed the giants, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "overtook them. And each of them was greater of stature than three other\r\n",
      "\n",
      "men, and a huge club was on the shoulder of each. Then he rushed upon\r\n",
      "\n",
      "one of them, and thrust his lance through his body. And having drawn\r\n",
      "\n",
      "it forth again, he pierced another of them through likewise. But the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "third turned upon him, and struck him with his club; so that he split\r\n",
      "\n",
      "his shield, and crushed his shoulder, and opened his wounds anew, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "all his blood began to flow from him. But Geraint drew his sword, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "attacked the giant, and gave him a blow on the crown of his head so\r\n",
      "\n",
      "severe and fierce and violent, that his head and his neck were split\r\n",
      "\n",
      "down to his shoulders, and he fell dead. So Geraint left him thus, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "returned to Enid. And when he saw her, he fell down lifeless from his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse. Piercing and loud and thrilling was the cry that Enid uttered.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And she came and stood over him where he had fallen. And at the sound\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of her cries came the Earl of Limours, and the host that journeyed with\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him, whom her lamentations brought out of their road. And the earl said\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to Enid, \"Alas, lady! what hath befallen thee?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, good sir!\" said she, \"the only man I have loved, or ever shall\r\n",
      "\n",
      "love, is slain.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he said to the other, \"And what is the cause of thy grief?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They have slain my beloved husband also,\" said she.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And who was it that slew them?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some giants,\" she answered, \"slew my best-beloved; and the other\r\n",
      "\n",
      "knight went in pursuit of them, and came back in the state thou seest,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "his blood flowing excessively. But it appears to me that he did not\r\n",
      "\n",
      "leave the giants without killing some of them, if not all.\" The earl\r\n",
      "\n",
      "caused the knight that was dead to be buried, but he thought that there\r\n",
      "\n",
      "still remained some life in Geraint; and to see if he yet would live,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he had him carried with him in the hollow of his shield, and upon a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "bier. And the two damsels went to the court; and when they arrived\r\n",
      "\n",
      "there, Geraint was placed upon a litter-couch in front of the table\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that was in the hall. Then they all took off their travelling-gear,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and the earl besought Enid to do the same, and to clothe her self in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "other garments.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will not, by Heaven!\" said she.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, lady!\" said he, \"be not so sorrowful for this matter.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It were hard to persuade me to be otherwise,\" said she.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will act towards thee in such wise, that thou needest not be\r\n",
      "\n",
      "sorrowful, whether yonder knight live or die. Behold, a good earldom,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "together with myself, will I bestow on thee. Be therefore happy and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "joyful.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare to Heaven,\" said she, \"that henceforth I shall never be\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, by Heaven, I will not,\" she answered.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, by Heaven, thou shalt,\" said he. So he took her with him to the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "table, against her will, and many times desired her to eat.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I call Heaven to witness,\" said she, \"that I will not eat until the\r\n",

      "man that is upon yonder bier shall eat likewise.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou canst not fulfil that,\" said the earl. \"Yonder man is dead\r\n",

      "already.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will prove that I can,\" said she.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he offered her a goblet of liquor. \"Drink this goblet,\" he said,\r\n",

      "\"and it will cause thee to change thy mind.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Truly,\" said the earl, \"it is of no more avail for me to be gentle\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with thee than ungentle.\" And he gave her a box in the ear. Thereupon\r\n",
      "\n",
      "she raised a loud and piercing shriek; and her lamentations were much\r\n",
      "\n",
      "greater than they had been before, for she considered in her mind,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that, had Geraint been alive, he durst not have struck her thus.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "But behold, at the sound of her cry, Geraint revived from his swoon,\r\n",

      "and he sat up on the bier, and, finding his sword in the hollow of his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "shield, he rushed to the place where the earl was, and struck him a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "fiercely-wounding, severely-venomous, and sternly-smiting blow upon the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "crown of his head, so that he clove him in twain, until his sword was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "stayed by the table. Then all left the board, and fled away. And this\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was not so much through fear of the living as through the dread they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "felt at seeing the dead man rise up to slay them. And Geraint looked\r\n",
      "\n",
      "upon Enid, and he was grieved for two causes: one was to see that Enid\r\n",
      "\n",
      "had lost her color and her wonted aspect; and the other, to know that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "she was in the right. \"Lady,\" said he, \"knowest thou where our horses\r\n",
      "\n",
      "are?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know, lord, where thy horse is,\" she replied; \"but I know not where\r\n",
      "\n",
      "is the other. Thy horse is in the house yonder.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "So he went to the house, and brought forth his horse, and mounted him,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and took up Enid from the ground, and placed her upon the horse with\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him. And he rode forward. And their road lay between two hedges. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the night was gaining on the day. And lo! they saw behind them the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "shafts of spears betwixt them and the sky, and they heard the trampling\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of horses and the noise of a host approaching. \"I hear something\r\n",
      "\n",
      "following us,\" said he, \"and I will put thee on the other side of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the hedge.\" And thus he did. And thereupon, behold, a knight pricked\r\n",
      "\n",
      "towards him, and couched his lance.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "When Enid saw this, she cried out, saying, \"O chieftain! whoever thou\r\n",
      "\n",
      "art, what renown wilt thou gain by slaying a dead man?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O Heaven!\" said he, \"is it Geraint?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, in truth,\" said she. \"And who art thou?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am the Little King,\" he answered, \"coming to thy assistance; for I\r\n",
      "\n",
      "heard that thou wast in trouble. And if thou hadst followed my advice,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "none of these hardships would have befallen thee.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing can happen,\" said Geraint, \"without the will of Heaven, though\r\n",
      "\n",
      "much good results from counsel.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the Little King; \"and I know good counsel for thee now.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Come with me to the court of a son-in-law of my sister, which is near\r\n",
      "\n",
      "here, and thou shalt have the best medical assistance in the kingdom.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will do so gladly,\" said Geraint. And Enid was placed upon the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse of one of the Little King's squires, and they went forward to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the baron's palace. And they were received there with gladness, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they met with hospitality and attention. And the next morning they went\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to seek physicians, and it was not long before they came; and they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "attended Geraint until he was perfectly well. And while Geraint was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "under medical care, the Little King caused his armor to be repaired,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "until it was as good as it had ever been. And they remained there a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "fortnight and a month.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Little King said to Geraint, \"Now will we go towards my own\r\n",

      "court, to take rest and amuse ourselves.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so,\" said Geraint. \"We will first journey for one day more, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "return again.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With all my heart!\" said the Little King. \"Do thou go then.\" And early\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in the day they set forth. And more gladly and more joyfully did Enid\r\n",
      "\n",
      "journey with them that day than she had ever done. And they came to the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "main road. And when they reached a place where the road divided in two,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they beheld a man on foot coming towards them along one of these roads;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and Gwiffert asked the man whence he came.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I come,\" said he, \"from an errand in the country.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me,\" said Geraint: \"which is the best for me to follow of these\r\n",

      "two roads?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is the best for thee to follow,\" answered he; \"for if thou goest\r\n",
      "\n",
      "by this one, thou wilt never return. Below us,\" said he, \"there is a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "hedge of mist, and within it are enchanted games; and no one who has\r\n",
      "\n",
      "gone there has ever returned. And the court of the Earl Owain is there,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and he permits no one to go to lodge in the town, except he will go to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "his court.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare to Heaven,\" said Geraint, \"that we will take the lower\r\n",
      "\n",
      "road.\" And they went along it until they came to the town. And they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "took the fairest and pleasantest place in the town for their lodging.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And while they were thus, behold, a young man came to them, and greeted\r\n",
      "\n",
      "them. \"Heaven be propitious to thee!\" said they.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good sirs,\" said he, \"what preparations are you making here?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are taking up our lodging,\" said they, \"to pass the night.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not the custom with him who owns the town,\" he answered, \"to\r\n",

      "permit any of gentle birth, unless they come to stay in his court, to\r\n",

      "abide here therefore: come ye to the court.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will come gladly,\" said Geraint. And they went with the page, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they were joyfully received. And the earl came to the hall to meet\r\n",
      "\n",
      "them, and he commanded the tables to be laid. And they washed, and sat\r\n",
      "\n",
      "down. And this is the order in which they sat: Geraint on one side of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the earl, and Enid on the other side, and next to Enid the Little King,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and then the countess next to Geraint; and all after that as became\r\n",
      "\n",
      "their rank. Then Geraint recollected the games, and thought that he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "should not go to them; and on that account he did not eat. Then the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "earl looked upon Geraint, and considered; and he bethought him that his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "not eating was because of the games, and it grieved him that he had\r\n",
      "\n",
      "ever established those games, were it only on account of losing such a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "youth as Geraint. And if Geraint had asked him to abolish the games, he\r\n",

      "would gladly have done so.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the earl said to Geraint, \"What thought occupies thy mind, that\r\n",
