      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1815, M. Charles-François-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D—— He was\n",
      "an old man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied the see\n",
      "of D—— since 1806.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance\n",
      "of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely\n",
      "for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various\n",
      "rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the\n",
      "very moment when he arrived in the diocese. True or false, that which\n",
      "is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and\n",
      "above all in their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the\n",
      "son of a councillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the\n",
      "nobility of the bar. It was said that his father, destining him to be\n",
      "the heir of his own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen\n",
      "or twenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent\n",
      "in parliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, however, it was\n",
      "said that Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk. He was well\n",
      "formed, though rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent;\n",
      "the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the\n",
      "world and to gallantry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation;\n",
      "the parliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were\n",
      "dispersed. M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning\n",
      "of the Revolution. There his wife died of a malady of the chest, from\n",
      "which she had long suffered. He had no children. What took place next\n",
      "in the fate of M. Myriel? The ruin of the French society of the olden\n",
      "days, the fall of his own family, the tragic spectacles of ’93, which\n",
      "were, perhaps, even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from\n",
      "a distance, with the magnifying powers of terror,—did these cause the\n",
      "ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him? Was he, in the\n",
      "midst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life,\n",
      "suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which\n",
      "sometimes overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public\n",
      "catastrophes would not shake, by striking at his existence and his\n",
      "fortune? No one could have told: all that was known was, that when he\n",
      "returned from Italy he was a priest.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1804, M. Myriel was the Curé of B—— [Brignolles]. He was already\n",
      "advanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with his\n",
      "curacy—just what, is not precisely known—took him to Paris. Among other\n",
      "powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners\n",
      "was M. le Cardinal Fesch. One day, when the Emperor had come to visit\n",
      "his uncle, the worthy Curé, who was waiting in the anteroom, found\n",
      "himself present when His Majesty passed. Napoleon, on finding himself\n",
      "observed with a certain curiosity by this old man, turned round and\n",
      "said abruptly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is this good man who is staring at me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sire,” said M. Myriel, “you are looking at a good man, and I at a\n",
      "great man. Each of us can profit by it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Curé,\n",
      "and some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn that\n",
      "he had been appointed Bishop of D——\n",
      "\n",
      "What truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented as\n",
      "to the early portion of M. Myriel’s life? No one knew. Very few\n",
      "families had been acquainted with the Myriel family before the\n",
      "Revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town,\n",
      "where there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads which think.\n",
      "He was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, and because he\n",
      "was a bishop. But after all, the rumors with which his name was\n",
      "connected were rumors only,—noise, sayings, words; less than\n",
      "words—_palabres_, as the energetic language of the South expresses it.\n",
      "\n",
      "However that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and of\n",
      "residence in D——, all the stories and subjects of conversation which\n",
      "engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into\n",
      "profound oblivion. No one would have dared to mention them; no one\n",
      "would have dared to recall them.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Myriel had arrived at D—— accompanied by an elderly spinster,\n",
      "Mademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years his junior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as\n",
      "Mademoiselle Baptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after having\n",
      "been _the servant of M. le Curé_, now assumed the double title of maid\n",
      "to Mademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; she\n",
      "realized the ideal expressed by the word “respectable”; for it seems\n",
      "that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable. She had\n",
      "never been pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing but a\n",
      "succession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a sort of\n",
      "pallor and transparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquired\n",
      "what may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been leanness in\n",
      "her youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity\n",
      "allowed the angel to be seen. She was a soul rather than a virgin. Her\n",
      "person seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to\n",
      "provide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever\n",
      "drooping;—a mere pretext for a soul’s remaining on the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent and\n",
      "bustling; always out of breath,—in the first place, because of her\n",
      "activity, and in the next, because of her asthma.\n",
      "\n",
      "On his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with\n",
      "the honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop\n",
      "immediately after a major-general. The mayor and the president paid the\n",
      "first call on him, and he, in turn, paid the first call on the general\n",
      "and the prefect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The episcopal palace of D—— adjoins the hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "The episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house, built of stone at\n",
      "the beginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology\n",
      "of the Faculty of Paris, Abbé of Simore, who had been Bishop of D—— in\n",
      "1712. This palace was a genuine seignorial residence. Everything about\n",
      "it had a grand air,—the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms,\n",
      "the chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walks\n",
      "encircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens\n",
      "planted with magnificent trees. In the dining-room, a long and superb\n",
      "gallery which was situated on the ground floor and opened on the\n",
      "gardens, M. Henri Puget had entertained in state, on July 29, 1714, My\n",
      "Lords Charles Brûlart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d’Embrun; Antoine\n",
      "de Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vendôme,\n",
      "Grand Prior of France, Abbé of Saint Honoré de Lérins; François de\n",
      "Berton de Crillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; César de Sabran de\n",
      "Forcalquier, bishop, Seignor of Glandève; and Jean Soanen, Priest of\n",
      "the Oratory, preacher in ordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of\n",
      "Senez. The portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this\n",
      "apartment; and this memorable date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there\n",
      "engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story, with a\n",
      "small garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. The\n",
      "visit ended, he had the director requested to be so good as to come to\n",
      "his house.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur the director of the hospital,” said he to him, “how many sick\n",
      "people have you at the present moment?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Twenty-six, Monseigneur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was the number which I counted,” said the Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The beds,” pursued the director, “are very much crowded against each\n",
      "other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is what I observed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The halls are nothing but rooms, and it is with difficulty that the\n",
      "air can be changed in them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“So it seems to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then, when there is a ray of sun, the garden is very small for the\n",
      "convalescents.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was what I said to myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“In case of epidemics,—we have had the typhus fever this year; we had\n",
      "the sweating sickness two years ago, and a hundred patients at\n",
      "times,—we know not what to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the thought which occurred to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What would you have, Monseigneur?” said the director. “One must resign\n",
      "one’s self.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This conversation took place in the gallery dining-room on the ground\n",
      "floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he turned abruptly to the\n",
      "director of the hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur,” said he, “how many beds do you think this hall alone would\n",
      "hold?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monseigneur’s dining-room?” exclaimed the stupefied director.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, and seemed to be taking\n",
      "measures and calculations with his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would hold full twenty beds,” said he, as though speaking to\n",
      "himself. Then, raising his voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold, Monsieur the director of the hospital, I will tell you\n",
      "something. There is evidently a mistake here. There are thirty-six of\n",
      "you, in five or six small rooms. There are three of us here, and we\n",
      "have room for sixty. There is some mistake, I tell you; you have my\n",
      "house, and I have yours. Give me back my house; you are at home here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the following day the thirty-six patients were installed in the\n",
      "Bishop’s palace, and the Bishop was settled in the hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by the\n",
      "Revolution. His sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five\n",
      "hundred francs, which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage.\n",
      "M. Myriel received from the State, in his quality of bishop, a salary\n",
      "of fifteen thousand francs. On the very day when he took up his abode\n",
      "in the hospital, M. Myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once\n",
      "for all, in the following manner. We transcribe here a note made by his\n",

      "M. Myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period\n",
      "that he occupied the see of D—— As has been seen, he called it\n",
      "_regulating his household expenses_.\n",
      "\n",
      "This arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by Mademoiselle\n",
      "Baptistine. This holy woman regarded Monseigneur of D—— as at one and\n",
      "the same time her brother and her bishop, her friend according to the\n",
      "flesh and her superior according to the Church. She simply loved and\n",
      "venerated him. When he spoke, she bowed; when he acted, she yielded her\n",
      "adherence. Their only servant, Madame Magloire, grumbled a little. It\n",
      "will be observed that Monsieur the Bishop had reserved for himself only\n",
      "one thousand livres, which, added to the pension of Mademoiselle\n",
      "Baptistine, made fifteen hundred francs a year. On these fifteen\n",
      "hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when a village curate came to D——, the Bishop still found means to\n",
      "entertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire, and to\n",
      "the intelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, after he had been in D—— about three months, the Bishop said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“And still I am quite cramped with it all!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should think so!” exclaimed Madame Magloire. “Monseigneur has not\n",
      "even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the\n",
      "expense of his carriage in town, and for his journeys about the\n",
      "diocese. It was customary for bishops in former days.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold!” cried the Bishop, “you are quite right, Madame Magloire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he made his demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some time afterwards the General Council took this demand under\n",
      "consideration, and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs,\n",
      "under this heading: _Allowance to M. the Bishop for expenses of\n",
      "carriage, expenses of posting, and expenses of pastoral visits._\n",
      "\n",
      "This provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; and a senator\n",
      "of the Empire, a former member of the Council of the Five Hundred which\n",
      "favored the 18 Brumaire, and who was provided with a magnificent\n",
      "senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of D——, wrote to M. Bigot\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted\n",
      "his carriage into alms. The diocese of D—— is a fatiguing one. There\n",
      "are very few plains and a great many mountains; hardly any roads, as we\n",
      "have just seen; thirty-two curacies, forty-one vicarships, and two\n",
      "hundred and eighty-five auxiliary chapels. To visit all these is quite\n",
      "a task.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop managed to do it. He went on foot when it was in the\n",
      "neighborhood, in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain, and on\n",
      "a donkey in the mountains. The two old women accompanied him. When the\n",
      "trip was too hard for them, he went alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day he arrived at Senez, which is an ancient episcopal city. He was\n",
      "mounted on an ass. His purse, which was very dry at that moment, did\n",
      "not permit him any other equipage. The mayor of the town came to\n",
      "receive him at the gate of the town, and watched him dismount from his\n",
      "ass, with scandalized eyes. Some of the citizens were laughing around\n",
      "him. “Monsieur the Mayor,” said the Bishop, “and Messieurs Citizens, I\n",
      "perceive that I shock you. You think it very arrogant in a poor priest\n",
      "to ride an animal which was used by Jesus Christ. I have done so from\n",
      "necessity, I assure you, and not from vanity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent, and talked\n",
      "rather than preached. He never went far in search of his arguments and\n",
      "his examples. He quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example\n",
      "of a neighboring district. In the cantons where they were harsh to the\n",
      "poor, he said: “Look at the people of Briançon! They have conferred on\n",
      "the poor, on widows and orphans, the right to have their meadows mown\n",
      "three days in advance of every one else. They rebuild their houses for\n",
      "them gratuitously when they are ruined. Therefore it is a country which\n",
      "is blessed by God. For a whole century, there has not been a single\n",
      "murderer among them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In villages which were greedy for profit and harvest, he said: “Look at\n",
      "the people of Embrun! If, at the harvest season, the father of a family\n",
      "has his son away on service in the army, and his daughters at service\n",
      "in the town, and if he is ill and incapacitated, the curé recommends\n",
      "him to the prayers of the congregation; and on Sunday, after the mass,\n",
      "all the inhabitants of the village—men, women, and children—go to the\n",
      "poor man’s field and do his harvesting for him, and carry his straw and\n",
      "his grain to his granary.” To families divided by questions of money\n",
      "and inheritance he said: “Look at the mountaineers of Devolny, a\n",
      "country so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty\n",
      "years. Well, when the father of a family dies, the boys go off to seek\n",
      "their fortunes, leaving the property to the girls, so that they may\n",
      "find husbands.” To the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits, and\n",
      "where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper, he said: “Look at\n",
      "those good peasants in the valley of Queyras! There are three thousand\n",
      "souls of them. Mon Dieu! it is like a little republic. Neither judge\n",
      "nor bailiff is known there. The mayor does everything. He allots the\n",
      "imposts, taxes each person conscientiously, judges quarrels for\n",
      "nothing, divides inheritances without charge, pronounces sentences\n",
      "gratuitously; and he is obeyed, because he is a just man among simple\n",
      "men.” To villages where he found no schoolmaster, he quoted once more\n",
      "the people of Queyras: “Do you know how they manage?” he said. “Since a\n",
      "little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a\n",
      "teacher, they have schoolmasters who are paid by the whole valley, who\n",
      "make the round of the villages, spending a week in this one, ten days\n",
      "in that, and instruct them. These teachers go to the fairs. I have seen\n",
      "them there. They are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear\n",
      "in the cord of their hat. Those who teach reading only have one pen;\n",
      "those who teach reading and reckoning have two pens; those who teach\n",
      "reading, reckoning, and Latin have three pens. But what a disgrace to\n",
      "be ignorant! Do like the people of Queyras!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus he discoursed gravely and paternally; in default of examples, he\n",
      "invented parables, going directly to the point, with few phrases and\n",
      "many images, which characteristic formed the real eloquence of Jesus\n",
      "Christ. And being convinced himself, he was persuasive.\n",

      "His conversation was gay and affable. He put himself on a level with\n",
      "the two old women who had passed their lives beside him. When he\n",
      "laughed, it was the laugh of a schoolboy. Madame Magloire liked to call\n",
      "him Your Grace [_Votre Grandeur_]. One day he rose from his armchair,\n",
      "and went to his library in search of a book. This book was on one of\n",
      "the upper shelves. As the bishop was rather short of stature, he could\n",
      "not reach it. “Madame Magloire,” said he, “fetch me a chair. My\n",
      "greatness [_grandeur_] does not reach as far as that shelf.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of his distant relatives, Madame la Comtesse de Lô, rarely allowed\n",
      "an opportunity to escape of enumerating, in his presence, what she\n",
      "designated as “the expectations” of her three sons. She had numerous\n",
      "relatives, who were very old and near to death, and of whom her sons\n",
      "were the natural heirs. The youngest of the three was to receive from a\n",
      "grandaunt a good hundred thousand livres of income; the second was the\n",
      "heir by entail to the title of the Duke, his uncle; the eldest was to\n",
      "succeed to the peerage of his grandfather. The Bishop was accustomed to\n",
      "listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts. On\n",
      "one occasion, however, he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual,\n",
      "while Madame de Lô was relating once again the details of all these\n",
      "inheritances and all these “expectations.” She interrupted herself\n",
      "impatiently: “Mon Dieu, cousin! What are you thinking about?” “I am\n",
      "thinking,” replied the Bishop, “of a singular remark, which is to be\n",
      "found, I believe, in St. Augustine,—‘Place your hopes in the man from\n",
      "whom you do not inherit.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At another time, on receiving a notification of the decease of a\n",
      "gentleman of the country-side, wherein not only the dignities of the\n",
      "dead man, but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his\n",
      "relatives, spread over an entire page: “What a stout back Death has!”\n",
      "he exclaimed. “What a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on\n",

      "into the service of vanity!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He was gifted, on occasion, with a gentle raillery, which almost always\n",
      "concealed a serious meaning. In the course of one Lent, a youthful\n",
      "vicar came to D——, and preached in the cathedral. He was tolerably\n",
      "eloquent. The subject of his sermon was charity. He urged the rich to\n",
      "give to the poor, in order to avoid hell, which he depicted in the most\n",
      "frightful manner of which he was capable, and to win paradise, which he\n",
      "represented as charming and desirable. Among the audience there was a\n",
      "wealthy retired merchant, who was somewhat of a usurer, named M.\n",
      "Géborand, who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse\n",
      "cloth, serges, and woollen galloons. Never in his whole life had M.\n",
      "Géborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch. After the delivery of that\n",
      "sermon, it was observed that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor old\n",
      "beggar-women at the door of the cathedral. There were six of them to\n",
      "share it. One day the Bishop caught sight of him in the act of\n",
      "bestowing this charity, and said to his sister, with a smile, “There is\n",
      "M. Géborand purchasing paradise for a sou.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was a question of charity, he was not to be rebuffed even by a\n",
      "refusal, and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which\n",
      "induced reflection. Once he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room\n",
      "of the town; there was present the Marquis de Champtercier, a wealthy\n",
      "and avaricious old man, who contrived to be, at one and the same time,\n",
      "an ultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairian. This variety of man has\n",
      "actually existed. When the Bishop came to him, he touched his arm,\n",
      "_“You must give me something, M. le Marquis.”_ The Marquis turned round\n",
      "and answered dryly, _“I have poor people of my own, Monseigneur.” “Give\n",
      "them to me,”_ replied the Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“My very dear brethren, my good friends, there are thirteen hundred and\n",
      "twenty thousand peasants’ dwellings in France which have but three\n",
      "openings; eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but\n",
      "two openings, the door and one window; and three hundred and forty-six\n",
      "thousand cabins besides which have but one opening, the door. And this\n",
      "arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows. Just\n",
      "put poor families, old women and little children, in those buildings,\n",
      "and behold the fevers and maladies which result! Alas! God gives air to\n",
      "men; the law sells it to them. I do not blame the law, but I bless God.\n",
      "In the department of the Isère, in the Var, in the two departments of\n",
      "the Alpes, the Hautes, and the Basses, the peasants have not even\n",
      "wheelbarrows; they transport their manure on the backs of men; they\n",
      "have no candles, and they burn resinous sticks, and bits of rope dipped\n",
      "in pitch. That is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the\n",
      "hilly country of Dauphiné. They make bread for six months at one time;\n",
      "they bake it with dried cow-dung. In the winter they break this bread\n",
      "up with an axe, and they soak it for twenty-four hours, in order to\n",
      "render it eatable. My brethren, have pity! behold the suffering on all\n",
      "sides of you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Born a Provençal, he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of\n",
      "the south. He said, _“En bé! moussu, sés sagé?”_ as in lower Languedoc;\n",
      "_“Onté anaras passa?”_ as in the Basses-Alpes; _“Puerte un bouen moutu\n",
      "embe un bouen fromage grase,”_ as in upper Dauphiné. This pleased the\n",
      "people extremely, and contributed not a little to win him access to all\n",
      "spirits. He was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the\n",
      "mountains. He understood how to say the grandest things in the most\n",
      "vulgar of idioms. As he spoke all tongues, he entered into all hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, he was the same towards people of the world and towards the\n",
      "lower classes. He condemned nothing in haste and without taking\n",

      "fault has passed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Being, as he described himself with a smile, an _ex-sinner_, he had\n",
      "none of the asperities of austerity, and he professed, with a good deal\n",
      "of distinctness, and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous, a\n",
      "doctrine which may be summed up as follows:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Man has upon him his flesh, which is at once his burden and his\n",
      "temptation. He drags it with him and yields to it. He must watch it,\n",
      "check it, repress it, and obey it only at the last extremity. There may\n",
      "be some fault even in this obedience; but the fault thus committed is\n",
      "venial; it is a fall, but a fall on the knees which may terminate in\n",
      "prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be a saint is the exception; to be an upright man is the rule. Err,\n",
      "fall, sin if you will, but be upright.\n",

      "“The least possible sin is the law of man. No sin at all is the dream\n",
      "of the angel. All which is terrestrial is subject to sin. Sin is a\n",
      "gravitation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly, and growing angry very\n",
      "quickly, “Oh! oh!” he said, with a smile; “to all appearance, this is a\n",
      "great crime which all the world commits. These are hypocrisies which\n",
      "have taken fright, and are in haste to make protest and to put\n",
      "themselves under shelter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He was indulgent towards women and poor people, on whom the burden of\n",

      "the fathers, the masters, the strong, the rich, and the wise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, moreover, “Teach those who are ignorant as many things as\n",
      "possible; society is culpable, in that it does not afford instruction\n",
      "gratis; it is responsible for the night which it produces. This soul is\n",
      "full of shadow; sin is therein committed. The guilty one is not the\n",

      "One day he heard a criminal case, which was in preparation and on the\n",
      "point of trial, discussed in a drawing-room. A wretched man, being at\n",
      "the end of his resources, had coined counterfeit money, out of love for\n",
      "a woman, and for the child which he had had by her. Counterfeiting was\n",
      "still punishable with death at that epoch. The woman had been arrested\n",
      "in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man. She was\n",
      "held, but there were no proofs except against her. She alone could\n",
      "accuse her lover, and destroy him by her confession. She denied; they\n",
      "insisted. She persisted in her denial. Thereupon an idea occurred to\n",
      "the attorney for the crown. He invented an infidelity on the part of\n",
      "the lover, and succeeded, by means of fragments of letters cunningly\n",
      "presented, in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival,\n",
      "and that the man was deceiving her. Thereupon, exasperated by jealousy,\n",
      "she denounced her lover, confessed all, proved all.\n",

      "The man was ruined. He was shortly to be tried at Aix with his\n",
      "accomplice. They were relating the matter, and each one was expressing\n",
      "enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate. By bringing jealousy\n",
      "into play, he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath, he had\n",
      "educed the justice of revenge. The Bishop listened to all this in\n",
      "silence. When they had finished, he inquired,—\n",

      "the most simple. He was father, brother, friend; he was bishop only to\n",
      "bless. He taught him everything, encouraged and consoled him. The man\n",

      "stood trembling on its mournful brink, he recoiled with horror. He was\n",

      "through, here and there, that wall which separates us from the mystery\n",
      "of things, and which we call life. He gazed incessantly beyond this\n",
      "world through these fatal breaches, and beheld only darkness. The\n",
      "Bishop made him see light.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the following day, when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch, the\n",
      "Bishop was still there. He followed him, and exhibited himself to the\n",
      "eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross\n",
      "upon his neck, side by side with the criminal bound with cords.\n",
      "\n",
      "He mounted the tumbril with him, he mounted the scaffold with him. The\n",
      "sufferer, who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day,\n",
      "was radiant. He felt that his soul was reconciled, and he hoped in God.\n",
      "The Bishop embraced him, and at the moment when the knife was about to\n",
      "fall, he said to him: “God raises from the dead him whom man slays; he\n",
      "whom his brothers have rejected finds his Father once more. Pray,\n",
      "believe, enter into life: the Father is there.” When he descended from\n",
      "the scaffold, there was something in his look which made the people\n",
      "draw aside to let him pass. They did not know which was most worthy of\n",
      "admiration, his pallor or his serenity. On his return to the humble\n",
      "dwelling, which he designated, with a smile, as _his palace_, he said\n",
      "to his sister, _“I have just officiated pontifically.”_\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the most sublime things are often those which are the least\n",
      "understood, there were people in the town who said, when commenting on\n",
      "this conduct of the Bishop, _“It is affectation.”_\n",
      "\n",
      "This, however, was a remark which was confined to the drawing-rooms.\n",
      "The populace, which perceives no jest in holy deeds, was touched, and\n",
      "admired him.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the Bishop, it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine,\n",
      "and it was a long time before he recovered from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, when the scaffold is there, all erected and prepared, it has\n",
      "something about it which produces hallucination. One may feel a certain\n",
      "indifference to the death penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing\n",
      "upon it, from saying yes or no, so long as one has not seen a\n",
      "guillotine with one’s own eyes: but if one encounters one of them, the\n",
      "shock is violent; one is forced to decide, and to take part for or\n",
      "against. Some admire it, like de Maistre; others execrate it, like\n",
      "Beccaria. The guillotine is the concretion of the law; it is called\n",
      "_vindicate_; it is not neutral, and it does not permit you to remain\n",
      "neutral. He who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers.\n",
      "All social problems erect their interrogation point around this\n",
      "chopping-knife. The scaffold is a vision. The scaffold is not a piece\n",
      "of carpentry; the scaffold is not a machine; the scaffold is not an\n",
      "inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood, iron and cords.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems as though it were a being, possessed of I know not what sombre\n",
      "initiative; one would say that this piece of carpenter’s work saw, that\n",
      "this machine heard, that this mechanism understood, that this wood,\n",
      "this iron, and these cords were possessed of will. In the frightful\n",
      "meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears\n",
      "in terrible guise, and as though taking part in what is going on. The\n",
      "scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner; it devours, it eats\n",
      "flesh, it drinks blood; the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by\n",
      "the judge and the carpenter, a spectre which seems to live with a\n",
      "horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the impression was terrible and profound; on the day\n",
      "following the execution, and on many succeeding days, the Bishop\n",
      "appeared to be crushed. The almost violent serenity of the funereal\n",
      "moment had disappeared; the phantom of social justice tormented him.\n",
      "He, who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant\n",
      "satisfaction, seemed to be reproaching himself. At times he talked to\n",
      "himself, and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice. This is\n",
      "one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved: “I did not\n",
      "think that it was so monstrous. It is wrong to become absorbed in the\n",
      "divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law. Death belongs\n",
      "to God alone. By what right do men touch that unknown thing?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished.\n",

      "and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife\n",
      "of his love, of the mother who had lost her child. As he knew the\n",
      "moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech. Oh, admirable\n",

      "“Have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead. Think\n",
      "not of that which perishes. Gaze steadily. You will perceive the living\n",

      "faith is wholesome. He sought to counsel and calm the despairing man,\n",
      "by pointing out to him the resigned man, and to transform the grief\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The house in which he lived consisted, as we have said, of a ground\n",
      "floor, and one story above; three rooms on the ground floor, three\n",
      "chambers on the first, and an attic above. Behind the house was a\n",
      "garden, a quarter of an acre in extent. The two women occupied the\n",
      "first floor; the Bishop was lodged below. The first room, opening on\n",
      "the street, served him as dining-room, the second was his bedroom, and\n",
      "the third his oratory. There was no exit possible from this oratory,\n",
      "except by passing through the bedroom, nor from the bedroom, without\n",
      "passing through the dining-room. At the end of the suite, in the\n",
      "oratory, there was a detached alcove with a bed, for use in cases of\n",
      "hospitality. The Bishop offered this bed to country curates whom\n",
      "business or the requirements of their parishes brought to D——\n",
      "\n",
      "The pharmacy of the hospital, a small building which had been added to\n",
      "the house, and abutted on the garden, had been transformed into a\n",
      "kitchen and cellar. In addition to this, there was in the garden a\n",
      "stable, which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital, and in\n",
      "which the Bishop kept two cows. No matter what the quantity of milk\n",
      "they gave, he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick\n",
      "people in the hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "_“I am paying my tithes,”_ he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "His bedroom was tolerably large, and rather difficult to warm in bad\n",
      "weather. As wood is extremely dear at D——, he hit upon the idea of\n",
      "having a compartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed. Here he\n",
      "passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold: he called it his\n",
      "_winter salon_.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no other\n",
      "furniture than a square table in white wood, and four straw-seated\n",
      "chairs. In addition to this the dining-room was ornamented with an\n",
      "antique sideboard, painted pink, in water colors. Out of a similar\n",
      "sideboard, properly draped with white napery and imitation lace, the\n",
      "Bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory.\n",
      "\n",
      "His wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D—— had more than once\n",
      "assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for\n",
      "Monseigneur’s oratory; on each occasion he had taken the money and had\n",
      "given it to the poor. “The most beautiful of altars,” he said, “is the\n",
      "soul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking God.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was an\n",
      "armchair, also in straw, in his bedroom. When, by chance, he received\n",
      "seven or eight persons at one time, the prefect, or the general, or the\n",
      "staff of the regiment in garrison, or several pupils from the little\n",
      "seminary, the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the\n",
      "stable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, and the armchair from the\n",
      "bedroom: in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for\n",
      "the visitors. A room was dismantled for each new guest.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party; the Bishop\n",
      "then relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front\n",
      "of the chimney if it was winter, or by strolling in the garden if it\n",
      "was summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was still another chair in the detached alcove, but the straw was\n",
      "half gone from it, and it had but three legs, so that it was of service\n",
      "only when propped against the wall. Mademoiselle Baptistine had also in\n",
      "her own room a very large easy-chair of wood, which had formerly been\n",
      "gilded, and which was covered with flowered pekin; but they had been\n",
      "obliged to hoist this bergère up to the first story through the window,\n",
      "as the staircase was too narrow; it could not, therefore, be reckoned\n",
      "among the possibilities in the way of furniture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mademoiselle Baptistine’s ambition had been to be able to purchase a\n",
      "set of drawing-room furniture in yellow Utrecht velvet, stamped with a\n",
      "rose pattern, and with mahogany in swan’s neck style, with a sofa. But\n",
      "this would have cost five hundred francs at least, and in view of the\n",
      "fact that she had only been able to lay by forty-two francs and ten\n",
      "sous for this purpose in the course of five years, she had ended by\n",
      "renouncing the idea. However, who is there who has attained his ideal?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the Bishop’s\n",
      "bedchamber. A glazed door opened on the garden; opposite this was the\n",
      "bed,—a hospital bed of iron, with a canopy of green serge; in the\n",
      "shadow of the bed, behind a curtain, were the utensils of the toilet,\n",
      "which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world: there\n",
      "were two doors, one near the chimney, opening into the oratory; the\n",
      "other near the bookcase, opening into the dining-room. The bookcase was\n",
      "a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books; the chimney was of\n",
      "wood painted to represent marble, and habitually without fire. In the\n",
      "chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron, ornamented above with two\n",
      "garlanded vases, and flutings which had formerly been silvered with\n",
      "silver leaf, which was a sort of episcopal luxury; above the\n",
      "chimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper, with the silver worn off,\n",
      "fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which\n",
      "the gilding had fallen; near the glass door a large table with an\n",
      "inkstand, loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes;\n",
      "before the table an armchair of straw; in front of the bed a prie-Dieu,\n",
      "borrowed from the oratory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of\n",
      "the bed. Small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at\n",
      "the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented, one\n",
      "the Abbé of Chaliot, bishop of Saint Claude; the other, the Abbé\n",
      "Tourteau, vicar-general of Agde, abbé of Grand-Champ, order of Cîteaux,\n",
      "diocese of Chartres. When the Bishop succeeded to this apartment, after\n",
      "the hospital patients, he had found these portraits there, and had left\n",
      "them. They were priests, and probably donors—two reasons for respecting\n",
      "them. All that he knew about these two persons was, that they had been\n",
      "appointed by the king, the one to his bishopric, the other to his\n",
      "benefice, on the same day, the 27th of April, 1785. Madame Magloire\n",
      "having taken the pictures down to dust, the Bishop had discovered these\n",
      "particulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper,\n",
      "yellowed by time, and attached to the back of the portrait of the Abbé\n",
      "of Grand-Champ with four wafers.\n",
      "\n",
      "At his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff,\n",
      "which finally became so old, that, in order to avoid the expense of a\n",
      "new one, Madame Magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very\n",
      "middle of it. This seam took the form of a cross. The Bishop often\n",
      "called attention to it: “How delightful that is!” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the ground\n",
      "floor as well as those on the first floor, were white-washed, which is\n",
      "a fashion in barracks and hospitals.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in their latter years, Madame Magloire discovered beneath the\n",
      "paper which had been washed over, paintings, ornamenting the apartment\n",
      "of Mademoiselle Baptistine, as we shall see further on. Before becoming\n",
      "a hospital, this house had been the ancient parliament house of the\n",
      "Bourgeois. Hence this decoration. The chambers were paved in red\n",
      "bricks, which were washed every week, with straw mats in front of all\n",
      "the beds. Altogether, this dwelling, which was attended to by the two\n",
      "women, was exquisitely clean from top to bottom. This was the sole\n",
      "luxury which the Bishop permitted. He said, _“That takes nothing from\n",
      "the poor.”_\n",
      "\n",
      "It must be confessed, however, that he still retained from his former\n",
      "possessions six silver knives and forks and a soup-ladle, which Madame\n",
      "Magloire contemplated every day with delight, as they glistened\n",
      "splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth. And since we are now painting\n",
      "the Bishop of D—— as he was in reality, we must add that he had said\n",
      "more than once, “I find it difficult to renounce eating from silver\n",
      "dishes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive\n",
      "silver, which he had inherited from a great-aunt. These candlesticks\n",
      "held two wax candles, and usually figured on the Bishop’s\n",
      "chimney-piece. When he had any one to dinner, Madame Magloire lighted\n",
      "the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Bishop’s own chamber, at the head of his bed, there was a small\n",
      "cupboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives and\n",
      "forks and the big spoon every night. But it is necessary to add, that\n",
      "the key was never removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The garden, which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which\n",
      "we have mentioned, was composed of four alleys in cross-form, radiating\n",
      "from a tank. Another walk made the circuit of the garden, and skirted\n",
      "the white wall which enclosed it. These alleys left behind them four\n",
      "square plots rimmed with box. In three of these, Madame Magloire\n",
      "cultivated vegetables; in the fourth, the Bishop had planted some\n",
      "flowers; here and there stood a few fruit-trees. Madame Magloire had\n",
      "once remarked, with a sort of gentle malice: “Monseigneur, you who turn\n",
      "everything to account, have, nevertheless, one useless plot. It would\n",
      "be better to grow salads there than bouquets.” “Madame Magloire,”\n",
      "retorted the Bishop, “you are mistaken. The beautiful is as useful as\n",
      "the useful.” He added after a pause, “More so, perhaps.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This plot, consisting of three or four beds, occupied the Bishop almost\n",
      "as much as did his books. He liked to pass an hour or two there,\n",
      "trimming, hoeing, and making holes here and there in the earth, into\n",
      "which he dropped seeds. He was not as hostile to insects as a gardener\n",
      "could have wished to see him. Moreover, he made no pretensions to\n",
      "botany; he ignored groups and consistency; he made not the slightest\n",
      "effort to decide between Tournefort and the natural method; he took\n",
      "part neither with the buds against the cotyledons, nor with Jussieu\n",
      "against Linnæus. He did not study plants; he loved flowers. He\n",
      "respected learned men greatly; he respected the ignorant still more;\n",
      "and, without ever failing in these two respects, he watered his\n",
      "flower-beds every summer evening with a tin watering-pot painted green.\n",

      "The house had not a single door which could be locked. The door of the\n",
      "dining-room, which, as we have said, opened directly on the cathedral\n",
      "square, had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door\n",
      "of a prison. The Bishop had had all this ironwork removed, and this\n",
      "door was never fastened, either by night or by day, with anything\n",
      "except the latch. All that the first passer-by had to do at any hour,\n",
      "was to give it a push. At first, the two women had been very much tried\n",
      "by this door, which was never fastened, but Monsieur de D—— had said to\n",
      "them, “Have bolts put on your rooms, if that will please you.” They had\n",
      "ended by sharing his confidence, or by at least acting as though they\n",
      "shared it. Madame Magloire alone had frights from time to time. As for\n",
      "the Bishop, his thought can be found explained, or at least indicated,\n",
      "in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a Bible, “This is\n",
      "the shade of difference: the door of the physician should never be\n",
      "shut, the door of the priest should always be open.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On another book, entitled _Philosophy of the Medical Science_, he had\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Again he wrote: “Do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of\n",

      "certain extent, in leaving his door unfastened day and night, at the\n",
      "mercy of any one who should choose to enter, and whether, in short, he\n",
      "did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little\n",

      "\n",
      "After the destruction of the band of Gaspard Bès, who had infested the\n",

      "way to Piédmont, and suddenly reappeared in France, in the vicinity of\n",
      "Barcelonette. He was first seen at Jauziers, then at Tuiles. He hid\n",

      "\n",
      "He even pushed as far as Embrun, entered the cathedral one night, and\n",
      "despoiled the sacristy. His highway robberies laid waste the\n",
      "country-side. The gendarmes were set on his track, but in vain. He\n",
      "always escaped; sometimes he resisted by main force. He was a bold\n",
      "wretch. In the midst of all this terror the Bishop arrived. He was\n",
      "making his circuit to Chastelar. The mayor came to meet him, and urged\n",
      "him to retrace his steps. Cravatte was in possession of the mountains\n",

      "their actions, their thoughts, their feminine instincts even, which are\n",
      "easily alarmed, to the habits and purposes of the Bishop, without his\n",
      "even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them, we cannot\n",
      "do better than transcribe in this place a letter from Mademoiselle\n",
      "Baptistine to Madame the Vicomtess de Boischevron, the friend of her\n",
      "childhood. This letter is in our possession.\n",
      "\n",
      "D——, Dec. 16, 18—. MY GOOD MADAM: Not a day passes without our speaking\n",
      "of you. It is our established custom; but there is another reason\n",
      "besides. Just imagine, while washing and dusting the ceilings and\n",
      "walls, Madam Magloire has made some discoveries; now our two chambers\n",
      "hung with antique paper whitewashed over, would not discredit a château\n",
      "in the style of yours. Madam Magloire has pulled off all the paper.\n",
      "There were things beneath. My drawing-room, which contains no\n",
      "furniture, and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing,\n",
      "is fifteen feet in height, eighteen square, with a ceiling which was\n",
      "formerly painted and gilded, and with beams, as in yours. This was\n",
      "covered with a cloth while this was the hospital. And the woodwork was\n",
      "of the era of our grandmothers. But my room is the one you ought to\n",
      "see. Madam Magloire has discovered, under at least ten thicknesses of\n",
      "paper pasted on top, some paintings, which without being good are very\n",
      "tolerable. The subject is Telemachus being knighted by Minerva in some\n",
      "gardens, the name of which escapes me. In short, where the Roman ladies\n",
      "repaired on one single night. What shall I say to you? I have Romans,\n",
      "and Roman ladies [here occurs an illegible word], and the whole train.\n",
      "Madam Magloire has cleaned it all off; this summer she is going to have\n",
      "some small injuries repaired, and the whole revarnished, and my chamber\n",
      "will be a regular museum. She has also found in a corner of the attic\n",
      "two wooden pier-tables of ancient fashion. They asked us two crowns of\n",
      "six francs each to regild them, but it is much better to give the money\n",
      "to the poor; and they are very ugly besides, and I should much prefer a\n",
      "round table of mahogany.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am always very happy. My brother is so good. He gives all he has to\n",
      "the poor and sick. We are very much cramped. The country is trying in\n",
      "the winter, and we really must do something for those who are in need.\n",
      "We are almost comfortably lighted and warmed. You see that these are\n",
      "great treats.\n",
      "\n",
      "My brother has ways of his own. When he talks, he says that a bishop\n",
      "ought to be so. Just imagine! the door of our house is never fastened.\n",
      "Whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother’s room. He\n",
      "fears nothing, even at night. That is his sort of bravery, he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "He does not wish me or Madame Magloire feel any fear for him. He\n",
      "exposes himself to all sorts of dangers, and he does not like to have\n",
      "us even seem to notice it. One must know how to understand him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He goes out in the rain, he walks in the water, he travels in winter.\n",
      "He fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters, nor night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers. He would not\n",
      "take us. He was absent for a fortnight. On his return nothing had\n",
      "happened to him; he was thought to be dead, but was perfectly well, and\n",
      "said, “This is the way I have been robbed!” And then he opened a trunk\n",
      "full of jewels, all the jewels of the cathedral of Embrun, which the\n",
      "thieves had given him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he returned on that occasion, I could not refrain from scolding\n",
      "him a little, taking care, however, not to speak except when the\n",
      "carriage was making a noise, so that no one might hear me.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first I used to say to myself, “There are no dangers which will stop\n",
      "him; he is terrible.” Now I have ended by getting used to it. I make a\n",
      "sign to Madam Magloire that she is not to oppose him. He risks himself\n",
      "as he sees fit. I carry off Madam Magloire, I enter my chamber, I pray\n",
      "for him and fall asleep. I am at ease, because I know that if anything\n",
      "were to happen to him, it would be the end of me. I should go to the\n",
      "good God with my brother and my bishop. It has cost Madam Magloire more\n",
      "trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his\n",
      "imprudences. But now the habit has been acquired. We pray together, we\n",
      "tremble together, and we fall asleep. If the devil were to enter this\n",
      "house, he would be allowed to do so. After all, what is there for us to\n",
      "fear in this house? There is always some one with us who is stronger\n",
      "than we. The devil may pass through it, but the good God dwells here.\n",
      "\n",
      "This suffices me. My brother has no longer any need of saying a word to\n",
      "me. I understand him without his speaking, and we abandon ourselves to\n",
      "the care of Providence. That is the way one has to do with a man who\n",
      "possesses grandeur of soul.\n",

      "a Jean de Faux, and a Thomas de Faux, who were gentlemen, and one of\n",
      "whom was a seigneur de Rochefort. The last was Guy-Étienne-Alexandre,\n",

      "trembled, but they let him alone. Sometimes Madame Magloire essayed a\n",
      "remonstrance in advance, but never at the time, nor afterwards. They\n",
      "never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign, in any action\n",

      "mention it, when he was not even conscious of it himself in all\n",
      "probability, so perfect was his simplicity, they vaguely felt that he\n",
      "was acting as a bishop; then they were nothing more than two shadows in\n",
      "the house. They served him passively; and if obedience consisted in\n",
      "disappearing, they disappeared. They understood, with an admirable\n",
      "delicacy of instinct, that certain cares may be put under constraint.\n",
      "Thus, even when believing him to be in peril, they understood, I will\n",
      "not say his thought, but his nature, to such a degree that they no\n",
      "longer watched over him. They confided him to God.\n",
      "\n",

      "Member of the Convention, G—— was mentioned with a sort of horror in\n",

      "_thou_, and when they said “citizen.” This man was almost a monster. He\n",
      "had not voted for the death of the king, but almost. He was a\n",
      "quasi-regicide. He had been a terrible man. How did it happen that such\n",
      "a man had not been brought before a provost’s court, on the return of\n",
      "the legitimate princes? They need not have cut off his head, if you\n",
      "please; clemency must be exercised, agreed; but a good banishment for\n",
      "life. An example, in short, etc. Besides, he was an atheist, like all\n",
      "the rest of those people. Gossip of the geese about the vulture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was G—— a vulture after all? Yes; if he were to be judged by the\n",
      "element of ferocity in this solitude of his. As he had not voted for\n",
      "the death of the king, he had not been included in the decrees of\n",
      "exile, and had been able to remain in France.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city, far\n",
      "from any hamlet, far from any road, in some hidden turn of a very wild\n",
      "valley, no one knew exactly where. He had there, it was said, a sort of\n",
      "field, a hole, a lair. There were no neighbors, not even passers-by.\n",
      "Since he had dwelt in that valley, the path which led thither had\n",
      "disappeared under a growth of grass. The locality was spoken of as\n",
      "though it had been the dwelling of a hangman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, the Bishop meditated on the subject, and from time to\n",
      "time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked\n",

      "impossible, and almost repulsive. For, at bottom, he shared the general\n",
      "impression, and the old member of the Convention inspired him, without\n",
      "his being clearly conscious of the fact himself, with that sentiment\n",
      "which borders on hate, and which is so well expressed by the word\n",

      "\n",
      "The sun was setting, and had almost touched the horizon when the Bishop\n",
      "arrived at the excommunicated spot. With a certain beating of the\n",
      "heart, he recognized the fact that he was near the lair. He strode over\n",
      "a ditch, leaped a hedge, made his way through a fence of dead boughs,\n",
      "entered a neglected paddock, took a few steps with a good deal of\n",
      "boldness, and suddenly, at the extremity of the waste land, and behind\n",
      "lofty brambles, he caught sight of the cavern.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very low hut, poor, small, and clean, with a vine nailed\n",
      "against the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Near the door, in an old wheel-chair, the armchair of the peasants,\n",

      "\n",

      "to my knees; now I feel it mounting to my waist; when it reaches the\n",
      "heart, I shall stop. The sun is beautiful, is it not? I had myself\n",
      "wheeled out here to take a last look at things. You can talk to me; it\n",
      "does not fatigue me. You have done well to come and look at a man who\n",
      "is on the point of death. It is well that there should be witnesses at\n",
      "that moment. One has one’s caprices; I should have liked to last until\n",
      "the dawn, but I know that I shall hardly live three hours. It will be\n",
      "night then. What does it matter, after all? Dying is a simple affair.\n",
      "One has no need of the light for that. So be it. I shall die by\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "The Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He did\n",
      "not think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the\n",
      "whole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated\n",
      "like the rest: he, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at “His\n",
      "Grace,” was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and\n",
      "he was almost tempted to retort “citizen.” He was assailed by a fancy\n",
      "for peevish familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but\n",
      "which was not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of\n",
      "the Convention, this representative of the people, had been one of the\n",
      "powerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably,\n",
      "the Bishop felt in a mood to be severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the member of the Convention had been surveying him with a\n",
      "modest cordiality, in which one could have distinguished, possibly,\n",

      "to dust.\n",

      "refrain from examining the member of the Convention with an attention\n",
      "which, as it did not have its course in sympathy, would have served his\n",
      "conscience as a matter of reproach, in connection with any other man. A\n",
      "member of the Convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being\n",
      "outside the pale of the law, even of the law of charity. G——, calm, his\n",

      "The Revolution had many of these men, proportioned to the epoch. In\n",
      "this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof. Though so\n",
      "near to his end, he preserved all the gestures of health. In his clear\n",
      "glance, in his firm tone, in the robust movement of his shoulders,\n",
      "there was something calculated to disconcert death. Azrael, the\n",
      "Mohammedan angel of the sepulchre, would have turned back, and thought\n",
      "that he had mistaken the door. G—— seemed to be dying because he willed\n",
      "it so. There was freedom in his agony. His legs alone were motionless.\n",
      "It was there that the shadows held him fast. His feet were cold and\n",
      "dead, but his head survived with all the power of life, and seemed full\n",
      "of light. G——, at this solemn moment, resembled the king in that tale\n",
      "of the Orient who was flesh above and marble below.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a stone there. The Bishop sat down. The exordium was abrupt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I congratulate you,” said he, in the tone which one uses for a\n",
      "reprimand. “You did not vote for the death of the king, after all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The old member of the Convention did not appear to notice the bitter\n",
      "meaning underlying the words “after all.” He replied. The smile had\n",
      "quite disappeared from his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do not congratulate me too much, sir. I did vote for the death of the\n",
      "tyrant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean to say?” resumed the Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean to say that man has a tyrant,—ignorance. I voted for the death\n",
      "of that tyrant. That tyrant engendered royalty, which is authority\n",
      "falsely understood, while science is authority rightly understood. Man\n",
      "should be governed only by science.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And conscience,” added the Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is the same thing. Conscience is the quantity of innate science\n",
      "which we have within us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur Bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language,\n",
      "which was very new to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The member of the Convention resumed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“So far as Louis XVI. was concerned, I said ‘no.’ I did not think that\n",
      "I had the right to kill a man; but I felt it my duty to exterminate\n",
      "evil. I voted the end of the tyrant, that is to say, the end of\n",
      "prostitution for woman, the end of slavery for man, the end of night\n",
      "for the child. In voting for the Republic, I voted for that. I voted\n",
      "for fraternity, concord, the dawn. I have aided in the overthrow of\n",
      "prejudices and errors. The crumbling away of prejudices and errors\n",
      "causes light. We have caused the fall of the old world, and the old\n",
      "world, that vase of miseries, has become, through its upsetting upon\n",
      "the human race, an urn of joy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mixed joy,” said the Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may say troubled joy, and to-day, after that fatal return of the\n",
      "past, which is called 1814, joy which has disappeared! Alas! The work\n",
      "was incomplete, I admit: we demolished the ancient regime in deeds; we\n",
      "were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas. To destroy abuses is\n",
      "not sufficient; customs must be modified. The mill is there no longer;\n",
      "the wind is still there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have demolished. It may be of use to demolish, but I distrust a\n",
      "demolition complicated with wrath.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right has its wrath, Bishop; and the wrath of right is an element of\n",
      "progress. In any case, and in spite of whatever may be said, the French\n",
      "Revolution is the most important step of the human race since the\n",
      "advent of Christ. Incomplete, it may be, but sublime. It set free all\n",
      "the unknown social quantities; it softened spirits, it calmed,\n",
      "appeased, enlightened; it caused the waves of civilization to flow over\n",
      "the earth. It was a good thing. The French Revolution is the\n",
      "consecration of humanity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop could not refrain from murmuring:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes? ’93!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The member of the Convention straightened himself up in his chair with\n",
      "an almost lugubrious solemnity, and exclaimed, so far as a dying man is\n",
      "capable of exclamation:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, there you go; ’93! I was expecting that word. A cloud had been\n",
      "forming for the space of fifteen hundred years; at the end of fifteen\n",
      "hundred years it burst. You are putting the thunderbolt on its trial.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop felt, without, perhaps, confessing it, that something within\n",
      "him had suffered extinction. Nevertheless, he put a good face on the\n",
      "matter. He replied:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The judge speaks in the name of justice; the priest speaks in the name\n",
      "of pity, which is nothing but a more lofty justice. A thunderbolt\n",
      "should commit no error.” And he added, regarding the member of the\n",
      "Convention steadily the while, “Louis XVII.?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the Bishop’s\n",
      "arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Louis XVII.! let us see. For whom do you mourn? is it for the innocent\n",
      "child? very good; in that case I mourn with you. Is it for the royal\n",
      "child? I demand time for reflection. To me, the brother of Cartouche,\n",
      "an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the Place de Grève,\n",
      "until death ensued, for the sole crime of having been the brother of\n",
      "Cartouche, is no less painful than the grandson of Louis XV., an\n",
      "innocent child, martyred in the tower of the Temple, for the sole crime\n",
      "of having been grandson of Louis XV.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur,” said the Bishop, “I like not this conjunction of names.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cartouche? Louis XV.? To which of the two do you object?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A momentary silence ensued. The Bishop almost regretted having come,\n",
      "and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conventionary resumed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, Monsieur Priest, you love not the crudities of the true. Christ\n",
      "loved them. He seized a rod and cleared out the Temple. His scourge,\n",
      "full of lightnings, was a harsh speaker of truths. When he cried,\n",
      "_‘Sinite parvulos,’_ he made no distinction between the little\n",
      "children. It would not have embarrassed him to bring together the\n",
      "Dauphin of Barabbas and the Dauphin of Herod. Innocence, Monsieur, is\n",
      "its own crown. Innocence has no need to be a highness. It is as august\n",
      "in rags as in fleurs de lys.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” said the Bishop in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I persist,” continued the conventionary G—— “You have mentioned Louis\n",
      "XVII. to me. Let us come to an understanding. Shall we weep for all the\n",
      "innocent, all martyrs, all children, the lowly as well as the exalted?\n",
      "I agree to that. But in that case, as I have told you, we must go back\n",
      "further than ’93, and our tears must begin before Louis XVII. I will\n",
      "weep with you over the children of kings, provided that you will weep\n",
      "with me over the children of the people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I weep for all,” said the Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Equally!” exclaimed conventionary G——; “and if the balance must\n",
      "incline, let it be on the side of the people. They have been suffering\n",
      "longer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another silence ensued. The conventionary was the first to break it. He\n",
      "raised himself on one elbow, took a bit of his cheek between his thumb\n",
      "and his forefinger, as one does mechanically when one interrogates and\n",
      "judges, and appealed to the Bishop with a gaze full of all the forces\n",
      "of the death agony. It was almost an explosion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir, the people have been suffering a long while. And hold! that\n",
      "is not all, either; why have you just questioned me and talked to me\n",
      "about Louis XVII.? I know you not. Ever since I have been in these\n",
      "parts I have dwelt in this enclosure alone, never setting foot outside,\n",
      "and seeing no one but that child who helps me. Your name has reached me\n",
      "in a confused manner, it is true, and very badly pronounced, I must\n",
      "admit; but that signifies nothing: clever men have so many ways of\n",
      "imposing on that honest goodman, the people. By the way, I did not hear\n",
      "the sound of your carriage; you have left it yonder, behind the coppice\n",
      "at the fork of the roads, no doubt. I do not know you, I tell you. You\n",
      "have told me that you are the Bishop; but that affords me no\n",
      "information as to your moral personality. In short, I repeat my\n",
      "question. Who are you? You are a bishop; that is to say, a prince of\n",
      "the church, one of those gilded men with heraldic bearings and\n",
      "revenues, who have vast prebends,—the bishopric of D—— fifteen thousand\n",
      "francs settled income, ten thousand in perquisites; total, twenty-five\n",
      "thousand francs,—who have kitchens, who have liveries, who make good\n",
      "cheer, who eat moor-hens on Friday, who strut about, a lackey before, a\n",
      "lackey behind, in a gala coach, and who have palaces, and who roll in\n",
      "their carriages in the name of Jesus Christ who went barefoot! You are\n",
      "a prelate,—revenues, palace, horses, servants, good table, all the\n",
      "sensualities of life; you have this like the rest, and like the rest,\n",
      "you enjoy it; it is well; but this says either too much or too little;\n",
      "this does not enlighten me upon the intrinsic and essential value of\n",
      "the man who comes with the probable intention of bringing wisdom to me.\n",
      "To whom do I speak? Who are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop hung his head and replied, _“Vermis sum_—I am a worm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“A worm of the earth in a carriage?” growled the conventionary.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the conventionary’s turn to be arrogant, and the Bishop’s to be\n",
      "humble.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop resumed mildly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“So be it, sir. But explain to me how my carriage, which is a few paces\n",
      "off behind the trees yonder, how my good table and the moor-hens which\n",
      "I eat on Friday, how my twenty-five thousand francs income, how my\n",
      "palace and my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty, and that ’93\n",
      "was not inexorable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The conventionary passed his hand across his brow, as though to sweep\n",
      "away a cloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Before replying to you,” he said, “I beseech you to pardon me. I have\n",
      "just committed a wrong, sir. You are at my house, you are my guest, I\n",
      "owe you courtesy. You discuss my ideas, and it becomes me to confine\n",
      "myself to combating your arguments. Your riches and your pleasures are\n",
      "advantages which I hold over you in the debate; but good taste dictates\n",
      "that I shall not make use of them. I promise you to make no use of them\n",
      "in the future.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thank you,” said the Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "G—— resumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me. Where\n",
      "were we? What were you saying to me? That ’93 was inexorable?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Inexorable; yes,” said the Bishop. “What think you of Marat clapping\n",
      "his hands at the guillotine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What think you of Bossuet chanting the _Te Deum_ over the\n",
      "dragonnades?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The retort was a harsh one, but it attained its mark with the\n",
      "directness of a point of steel. The Bishop quivered under it; no reply\n",
      "occurred to him; but he was offended by this mode of alluding to\n",
      "Bossuet. The best of minds will have their fetiches, and they sometimes\n",
      "feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conventionary began to pant; the asthma of the agony which is\n",
      "mingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice; still, there was a\n",
      "perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes. He went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me say a few words more in this and that direction; I am willing.\n",
      "Apart from the Revolution, which, taken as a whole, is an immense human\n",
      "affirmation, ’93 is, alas! a rejoinder. You think it inexorable, sir;\n",
      "but what of the whole monarchy, sir? Carrier is a bandit; but what name\n",
      "do you give to Montrevel? Fouquier-Tainville is a rascal; but what is\n",
      "your opinion as to Lamoignon-Bâville? Maillard is terrible; but\n",
      "Saulx-Tavannes, if you please? Duchêne senior is ferocious; but what\n",
      "epithet will you allow me for the elder Letellier? Jourdan-Coupe-Tetê\n",
      "is a monster; but not so great a one as M. the Marquis de Louvois. Sir,\n",
      "sir, I am sorry for Marie Antoinette, archduchess and queen; but I am\n",
      "also sorry for that poor Huguenot woman, who, in 1685, under Louis the\n",
      "Great, sir, while with a nursing infant, was bound, naked to the waist,\n",
      "to a stake, and the child kept at a distance; her breast swelled with\n",
      "milk and her heart with anguish; the little one, hungry and pale,\n",
      "beheld that breast and cried and agonized; the executioner said to the\n",
      "woman, a mother and a nurse, ‘Abjure!’ giving her her choice between\n",
      "the death of her infant and the death of her conscience. What say you\n",
      "to that torture of Tantalus as applied to a mother? Bear this well in\n",
      "mind sir: the French Revolution had its reasons for existence; its\n",
      "wrath will be absolved by the future; its result is the world made\n",
      "better. From its most terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the\n",
      "human race. I abridge, I stop, I have too much the advantage; moreover,\n",
      "I am dying.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And ceasing to gaze at the Bishop, the conventionary concluded his\n",
      "thoughts in these tranquil words:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, the brutalities of progress are called revolutions. When they are\n",
      "over, this fact is recognized,—that the human race has been treated\n",
      "harshly, but that it has progressed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all\n",
      "the inmost intrenchments of the Bishop. One remained, however, and from\n",
      "this intrenchment, the last resource of Monseigneur Bienvenu’s\n",
      "resistance, came forth this reply, wherein appeared nearly all the\n",
      "harshness of the beginning:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Progress should believe in God. Good cannot have an impious servitor.\n",
      "He who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The former representative of the people made no reply. He was seized\n",
      "with a fit of trembling. He looked towards heaven, and in his glance a\n",
      "tear gathered slowly. When the eyelid was full, the tear trickled down\n",
      "his livid cheek, and he said, almost in a stammer, quite low, and to\n",
      "himself, while his eyes were plunged in the depths:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“O thou! O ideal! Thou alone existest!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop experienced an indescribable shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a pause, the old man raised a finger heavenward and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The infinite is. He is there. If the infinite had no person, person\n",
      "would be without limit; it would not be infinite; in other words, it\n",
      "would not exist. There is, then, an _I_. That _I_ of the infinite is\n",
      "God.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice, and with\n",
      "the shiver of ecstasy, as though he beheld some one. When he had\n",
      "spoken, his eyes closed. The effort had exhausted him. It was evident\n",
      "that he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been\n",
      "left to him. That which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in\n",
      "death. The supreme moment was approaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop understood this; time pressed; it was as a priest that he\n",
      "had come: from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme\n",
      "emotion; he gazed at those closed eyes, he took that wrinkled, aged and\n",
      "ice-cold hand in his, and bent over the dying man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This hour is the hour of God. Do you not think that it would be\n",
      "regrettable if we had met in vain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The conventionary opened his eyes again. A gravity mingled with gloom\n",
      "was imprinted on his countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bishop,” said he, with a slowness which probably arose more from his\n",
      "dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength, “I have passed\n",
      "my life in meditation, study, and contemplation. I was sixty years of\n",
      "age when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with\n",
      "its affairs. I obeyed. Abuses existed, I combated them; tyrannies\n",
      "existed, I destroyed them; rights and principles existed, I proclaimed\n",
      "and confessed them. Our territory was invaded, I defended it; France\n",
      "was menaced, I offered my breast. I was not rich; I am poor. I have\n",
      "been one of the masters of the state; the vaults of the treasury were\n",
      "encumbered with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up\n",
      "the walls, which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of\n",
      "gold and silver; I dined in Dead Tree Street, at twenty-two sous. I\n",
      "have succored the oppressed, I have comforted the suffering. I tore the\n",
      "cloth from the altar, it is true; but it was to bind up the wounds of\n",
      "my country. I have always upheld the march forward of the human race,\n",
      "forward towards the light, and I have sometimes resisted progress\n",
      "without pity. I have, when the occasion offered, protected my own\n",
      "adversaries, men of your profession. And there is at Peteghem, in\n",
      "Flanders, at the very spot where the Merovingian kings had their summer\n",
      "palace, a convent of Urbanists, the Abbey of Sainte Claire en Beaulieu,\n",
      "which I saved in 1793. I have done my duty according to my powers, and\n",
      "all the good that I was able. After which, I was hunted down, pursued,\n",
      "persecuted, blackened, jeered at, scorned, cursed, proscribed. For many\n",
      "years past, I with my white hair have been conscious that many people\n",
      "think they have the right to despise me; to the poor ignorant masses I\n",
      "present the visage of one damned. And I accept this isolation of\n",
      "hatred, without hating any one myself. Now I am eighty-six years old; I\n",
      "am on the point of death. What is it that you have come to ask of me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "_“Your blessing,”_ said the Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he knelt down.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Bishop raised his head again, the face of the conventionary\n",
      "had become august. He had just expired.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop returned home, deeply absorbed in thoughts which cannot be\n",
      "known to us. He passed the whole night in prayer. On the following\n",
      "morning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about\n",
      "member of the Convention G——; he contented himself with pointing\n",
      "heavenward.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling\n",
      "towards all children and sufferers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any allusion to “that old wretch of a G——” caused him to fall into a\n",
      "singular preoccupation. No one could say that the passage of that soul\n",
      "before his, and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his, did\n",
      "not count for something in his approach to perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "This “pastoral visit” naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of\n",
      "comment in all the little local coteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a\n",
      "bishop? There was evidently no conversion to be expected. All those\n",
      "revolutionists are backsliders. Then why go there? What was there to be\n",
      "seen there? He must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried\n",
      "off by the devil.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself\n",
      "spiritual, addressed this sally to him, “Monseigneur, people are\n",
      "inquiring when Your Greatness will receive the red cap!”—“Oh! oh!\n",
      "that’s a coarse color,” replied the Bishop. “It is lucky that those who\n",

      "Some time after the elevation of M. Myriel to the episcopate, the\n",

      "bishops. The arrest of the Pope took place, as every one knows, on the\n",
      "night of the 5th to the 6th of July, 1809; on this occasion, M. Myriel\n",
      "was summoned by Napoleon to the synod of the bishops of France and\n",
      "Italy convened at Paris. This synod was held at Notre-Dame, and\n",
      "assembled for the first time on the 15th of June, 1811, under the\n",
      "presidency of Cardinal Fesch. M. Myriel was one of the ninety-five\n",
      "bishops who attended it. But he was present only at one sitting and at\n",
      "three or four private conferences. Bishop of a mountain diocese, living\n",
      "so very close to nature, in rusticity and deprivation, it appeared that\n",
      "he imported among these eminent personages, ideas which altered the\n",
      "temperature of the assembly. He very soon returned to D—— He was\n",
      "interrogated as to this speedy return, and he replied: _“I embarrassed\n",
      "them. The outside air penetrated to them through me. I produced on them\n",
      "the effect of an open door.”_\n",
      "\n",
      "On another occasion he said, _“What would you have? Those gentlemen are\n",
      "princes. I am only a poor peasant bishop.”_\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact is that he displeased them. Among other strange things, it is\n",

      "the house of one of his most notable colleagues: “What beautiful\n",
      "clocks! What beautiful carpets! What beautiful liveries! They must be a\n",

      "Nevertheless, in churchmen, luxury is wrong, except in connection with\n",
      "representations and ceremonies. It seems to reveal habits which have\n",
      "very little that is charitable about them. An opulent priest is a\n",
      "contradiction. The priest must keep close to the poor. Now, can one\n",
      "come in contact incessantly night and day with all this distress, all\n",
      "these misfortunes, and this poverty, without having about one’s own\n",
      "person a little of that misery, like the dust of labor? Is it possible\n",
      "to imagine a man near a brazier who is not warm? Can one imagine a\n",
      "workman who is working near a furnace, and who has neither a singed\n",
      "hair, nor blackened nails, nor a drop of sweat, nor a speck of ashes on\n",

      "on questions in which Church and State were implicated; but if he had\n",
      "been strongly pressed, it seems that he would have been found to be an\n",
      "ultramontane rather than a gallican. Since we are making a portrait,\n",
      "and since we do not wish to conceal anything, we are forced to add that\n",
      "he was glacial towards Napoleon in his decline. Beginning with 1813, he\n",
      "gave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations. He\n",
      "refused to see him, as he passed through on his return from the island\n",
      "of Elba, and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the Emperor\n",
      "in his diocese during the Hundred Days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, he had two brothers, one a\n",
      "general, the other a prefect. He wrote to both with tolerable\n",
      "frequency. He was harsh for a time towards the former, because, holding\n",
      "a command in Provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at Cannes, the\n",
      "general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had\n",
      "pursued the Emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is\n",

      "Certainly, such a man would have done well not to entertain any\n",

      "this: It would have been well if Monseigneur Bienvenu had not been a\n",

      "turned away from that serene contemplation in which is distinctly\n",
      "discernible, above the fictions and the hatreds of this world, above\n",
      "the stormy vicissitudes of human things, the beaming of those three\n",
      "pure radiances, truth, justice, and charity.\n",
      "\n",
      "While admitting that it was not for a political office that God created\n",

      "in the name of right and liberty, his proud opposition, his just but\n",
      "perilous resistance to the all-powerful Napoleon. But that which\n",

      "the right to be the exterminators of the last. He who has not been a\n",
      "stubborn accuser in prosperity should hold his peace in the face of\n",
      "ruin. The denunciator of success is the only legitimate executioner of\n",
      "the fall. As for us, when Providence intervenes and strikes, we let it\n",
      "work. 1812 commenced to disarm us. In 1813 the cowardly breach of\n",
      "silence of that taciturn legislative body, emboldened by catastrophe,\n",
      "possessed only traits which aroused indignation. And it was a crime to\n",
      "applaud, in 1814, in the presence of those marshals who betrayed; in\n",
      "the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill to another,\n",
      "insulting after having deified; in the presence of that idolatry which\n",
      "was loosing its footing and spitting on its idol,—it was a duty to turn\n",
      "aside the head. In 1815, when the supreme disasters filled the air,\n",
      "when France was seized with a shiver at their sinister approach, when\n",
      "Waterloo could be dimly discerned opening before Napoleon, the mournful\n",

      "nothing laughable in it, and, after making all allowance for the\n",
      "despot, a heart like that of the Bishop of D——, ought not perhaps to\n",

      "With this exception, he was in all things just, true, equitable,\n",
      "intelligent, humble and dignified, beneficent and kindly, which is only\n",
      "another sort of benevolence. He was a priest, a sage, and a man. It\n",
      "must be admitted, that even in the political views with which we have\n",
      "just reproached him, and which we are disposed to judge almost with\n",
      "severity, he was tolerant and easy, more so, perhaps, than we who are\n",

      "as the eagle. This poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate\n",
      "remarks, which the law then stigmatized as _seditious speeches_. After\n",
      "the imperial profile disappeared from the Legion of Honor, he never\n",

      "a hole, and he would not put anything in its place. _“I will die,”_ he\n",

      "that he lost his place. There he was, turned out of the house, with his\n",

      "orthodoxy. In the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood\n",
      "but respect. The conscience of the just man should be accepted on his\n",
      "word. Moreover, certain natures being given, we admit the possible\n",
      "development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs\n",
      "from our own.\n",
      "\n",
      "What did he think of this dogma, or of that mystery? These secrets of\n",
      "the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb, where\n",
      "souls enter naked. The point on which we are certain is, that the\n",
      "difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his\n",
      "case. No decay is possible to the diamond. He believed to the extent of\n",
      "his powers. _“Credo in Patrem,”_ he often exclaimed. Moreover, he drew\n",
      "from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the\n",
      "conscience, and which whispers to a man, “Thou art with God!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The point which we consider it our duty to note is, that outside of and\n",
      "beyond his faith, as it were, the Bishop possessed an excess of love.\n",
      "It was in that quarter, _quia multum amavit_,—because he loved\n",
      "much—that he was regarded as vulnerable by “serious men,” “grave\n",
      "persons” and “reasonable people”; favorite locutions of our sad world\n",
      "where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry. What was this\n",
      "excess of love? It was a serene benevolence which overflowed men, as we\n",
      "have already pointed out, and which, on occasion, extended even to\n",
      "things. He lived without disdain. He was indulgent towards God’s\n",
      "creation. Every man, even the best, has within him a thoughtless\n",
      "harshness which he reserves for animals. The Bishop of D—— had none of\n",
      "that harshness, which is peculiar to many priests, nevertheless. He did\n",
      "not go as far as the Brahmin, but he seemed to have weighed this saying\n",
      "of Ecclesiastes: “Who knoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth?”\n",
      "Hideousness of aspect, deformity of instinct, troubled him not, and did\n",
      "not arouse his indignation. He was touched, almost softened by them. It\n",
      "seemed as though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of\n",
      "life which is apparent, the cause, the explanation, or the excuse for\n",
      "them. He seemed at times to be asking God to commute these penalties.\n",
      "He examined without wrath, and with the eye of a linguist who is\n",
      "deciphering a palimpsest, that portion of chaos which still exists in\n",
      "nature. This reverie sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings. One\n",
      "morning he was in his garden, and thought himself alone, but his sister\n",
      "was walking behind him, unseen by him: suddenly he paused and gazed at\n",
      "something on the ground; it was a large, black, hairy, frightful\n",

      "When he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his\n",

      "and ruddy complexion, his very white teeth, all of which he had\n",
      "preserved, and which were displayed by his smile, gave him that open\n",
      "and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man, “He’s a good\n",

      "in fact, but a fine man. But if one remained near him for a few hours,\n",
      "and beheld him in the least degree pensive, the fine man became\n",
      "gradually transfigured, and took on some imposing quality, I know not\n",
      "what; his broad and serious brow, rendered august by his white locks,\n",
      "became august also by virtue of meditation; majesty radiated from his\n",

      "rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before\n",
      "going to bed, and after the two women had retired. It seemed to be a\n",
      "sort of rite with him, to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in\n",

      "Sometimes, if the two old women were not asleep, they heard him pacing\n",
      "slowly along the walks at a very advanced hour of the night. He was\n",

      "darkness by the visible splendor of the constellations and the\n",

      "hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume, illuminated like a\n",
      "lamp amid the starry night, as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the\n",
      "midst of the universal radiance of creation, he could not have told\n",
      "himself, probably, what was passing in his spirit; he felt something\n",

      "One last word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since this sort of details might, particularly at the present moment,\n",
      "and to use an expression now in fashion, give to the Bishop of D—— a\n",
      "certain “pantheistical” physiognomy, and induce the belief, either to\n",
      "his credit or discredit, that he entertained one of those personal\n",
      "philosophies which are peculiar to our century, which sometimes spring\n",
      "up in solitary spirits, and there take on a form and grow until they\n",
      "usurp the place of religion, we insist upon it, that not one of those\n",
      "persons who knew Monseigneur Welcome would have thought himself\n",
      "authorized to think anything of the sort. That which enlightened this\n",
      "man was his heart. His wisdom was made of the light which comes from\n",
      "there.\n",
      "\n",
      "No systems; many works. Abstruse speculations contain vertigo; no,\n",
      "there is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses.\n",
      "The apostle may be daring, but the bishop must be timid. He would\n",
      "probably have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain\n",
      "problems which are, in a manner, reserved for terrible great minds.\n",
      "There is a sacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma; those\n",
      "gloomy openings stand yawning there, but something tells you, you, a\n",
      "passer-by in life, that you must not enter. Woe to him who penetrates\n",
      "thither!\n",
      "\n",
      "Geniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure\n",
      "speculation, situated, so to speak, above all dogmas, propose their\n",
      "ideas to God. Their prayer audaciously offers discussion. Their\n",
      "adoration interrogates. This is direct religion, which is full of\n",
      "anxiety and responsibility for him who attempts its steep cliffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human meditation has no limits. At his own risk and peril, it analyzes\n",
      "and digs deep into its own bedazzlement. One might almost say, that by\n",
      "a sort of splendid reaction, it with it dazzles nature; the mysterious\n",
      "world which surrounds us renders back what it has received; it is\n",
      "probable that the contemplators are contemplated. However that may be,\n",
      "there are on earth men who—are they men?—perceive distinctly at the\n",
      "verge of the horizons of reverie the heights of the absolute, and who\n",
      "have the terrible vision of the infinite mountain. Monseigneur Welcome\n",
      "was one of these men; Monseigneur Welcome was not a genius. He would\n",
      "have feared those sublimities whence some very great men even, like\n",
      "Swedenborg and Pascal, have slipped into insanity. Certainly, these\n",
      "powerful reveries have their moral utility, and by these arduous paths\n",
      "one approaches to ideal perfection. As for him, he took the path which\n",
      "shortens,—the Gospel’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of Elijah’s\n",
      "mantle; he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of\n",
      "events; he did not see to condense in flame the light of things; he had\n",
      "nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him. This\n",
      "humble soul loved, and that was all.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is\n",
      "probable: but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much;\n",
      "and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts, Saint Theresa and Saint\n",
      "Jerome would be heretics.\n",
      "\n",
      "He inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates. The universe\n",
      "appeared to him like an immense malady; everywhere he felt fever,\n",
      "everywhere he heard the sound of suffering, and, without seeking to\n",
      "solve the enigma, he strove to dress the wound. The terrible spectacle\n",
      "of created things developed tenderness in him; he was occupied only in\n",
      "finding for himself, and in inspiring others with the best way to\n",
      "compassionate and relieve. That which exists was for this good and rare\n",
      "priest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are men who toil at extracting gold; he toiled at the extraction\n",
      "of pity. Universal misery was his mine. The sadness which reigned\n",
      "everywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness. _Love each other;_\n",
      "he declared this to be complete, desired nothing further, and that was\n",
      "the whole of his doctrine. One day, that man who believed himself to be\n",
      "a “philosopher,” the senator who has already been alluded to, said to\n",
      "the Bishop: “Just survey the spectacle of the world: all war against\n",
      "all; the strongest has the most wit. Your _love each other_ is\n",
      "nonsense.”—_“Well,”_ replied Monseigneur Welcome, without contesting\n",
      "the point, _“if it is nonsense, the soul should shut itself up in it,\n",
      "as the pearl in the oyster.”_ Thus he shut himself up, he lived there,\n",
      "he was absolutely satisfied with it, leaving on one side the prodigious\n",
      "questions which attract and terrify, the fathomless perspectives of\n",
      "abstraction, the precipices of metaphysics—all those profundities which\n",
      "converge, for the apostle in God, for the atheist in nothingness;\n",
      "destiny, good and evil, the way of being against being, the conscience\n",
      "of man, the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal, the transformation\n",

      "Early in the month of October, 1815, about an hour before sunset, a man\n",
      "who was travelling on foot entered the little town of D—— The few\n",
      "inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the\n",
      "moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness. It was\n",
      "difficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance. He was a\n",
      "man of medium stature, thickset and robust, in the prime of life. He\n",
      "might have been forty-six or forty-eight years old. A cap with a\n",
      "drooping leather visor partly concealed his face, burned and tanned by\n",
      "sun and wind, and dripping with perspiration. His shirt of coarse\n",
      "yellow linen, fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor, permitted\n",
      "a view of his hairy breast: he had a cravat twisted into a string;\n",
      "trousers of blue drilling, worn and threadbare, white on one knee and\n",
      "torn on the other; an old gray, tattered blouse, patched on one of the\n",
      "elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on with twine; a tightly packed\n",
      "soldier knapsack, well buckled and perfectly new, on his back; an\n",
      "enormous, knotty stick in his hand; iron-shod shoes on his stockingless\n",
      "feet; a shaved head and a long beard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sweat, the heat, the journey on foot, the dust, added I know not\n",
      "what sordid quality to this dilapidated whole. His hair was closely\n",
      "cut, yet bristling, for it had begun to grow a little, and did not seem\n",
      "to have been cut for some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one knew him. He was evidently only a chance passer-by. Whence came\n",
      "he? From the south; from the seashore, perhaps, for he made his\n",
      "entrance into D—— by the same street which, seven months previously,\n",
      "had witnessed the passage of the Emperor Napoleon on his way from\n",
      "Cannes to Paris. This man must have been walking all day. He seemed\n",
      "very much fatigued. Some women of the ancient market town which is\n",
      "situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the\n",
      "boulevard Gassendi, and drink at the fountain which stands at the end\n",
      "of the promenade. He must have been very thirsty: for the children who\n",
      "followed him saw him stop again for a drink, two hundred paces further\n",
      "on, at the fountain in the market-place.\n",
      "\n",
      "On arriving at the corner of the Rue Poichevert, he turned to the left,\n",
      "and directed his steps toward the town-hall. He entered, then came out\n",
      "a quarter of an hour later. A gendarme was seated near the door, on the\n",
      "stone bench which General Drouot had mounted on the 4th of March to\n",
      "read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of D—— the\n",
      "proclamation of the Gulf Juan. The man pulled off his cap and humbly\n",
      "saluted the gendarme.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gendarme, without replying to his salute, stared attentively at\n",
      "him, followed him for a while with his eyes, and then entered the\n",
      "town-hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "There then existed at D—— a fine inn at the sign of the _Cross of\n",
      "Colbas_. This inn had for a landlord a certain Jacquin Labarre, a man\n",
      "of consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another\n",
      "Labarre, who kept the inn of the _Three Dauphins_ in Grenoble, and had\n",
      "served in the Guides. At the time of the Emperor’s landing, many rumors\n",
      "had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the\n",
      "_Three Dauphins_. It was said that General Bertrand, disguised as a\n",
      "carter, had made frequent trips thither in the month of January, and\n",
      "that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls\n",
      "of gold to the citizens. The truth is, that when the Emperor entered\n",
      "Grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the\n",
      "prefecture; he had thanked the mayor, saying, _“I am going to the house\n",
      "of a brave man of my acquaintance”;_ and he had betaken himself to the\n",
      "_Three Dauphins_. This glory of the Labarre of the _Three Dauphins_ was\n",
      "reflected upon the Labarre of the _Cross of Colbas_, at a distance of\n",
      "five and twenty leagues. It was said of him in the town, _“That is the\n",
      "cousin of the man of Grenoble.”_\n",
      "\n",
      "The man bent his steps towards this inn, which was the best in the\n",
      "country-side. He entered the kitchen, which opened on a level with the\n",
      "street. All the stoves were lighted; a huge fire blazed gayly in the\n",
      "fireplace. The host, who was also the chief cook, was going from one\n",
      "stew-pan to another, very busily superintending an excellent dinner\n",
      "designed for the wagoners, whose loud talking, conversation, and\n",
      "laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment. Any one who has\n",
      "travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than\n",
      "wagoners. A fat marmot, flanked by white partridges and heather-cocks,\n",
      "was turning on a long spit before the fire; on the stove, two huge\n",
      "carps from Lake Lauzet and a trout from Lake Alloz were cooking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The host, hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter, said,\n",

      "\n",
      "“What do you wish, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Food and lodging,” said the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing easier,” replied the host. At that moment he turned his head,\n",
      "took in the traveller’s appearance with a single glance, and added, “By\n",
      "paying for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse, and\n",
      "answered, “I have money.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“In that case, we are at your service,” said the host.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man put his purse back in his pocket, removed his knapsack from his\n",
      "back, put it on the ground near the door, retained his stick in his\n",
      "hand, and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire. D—— is in\n",
      "the mountains. The evenings are cold there in October.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as the host went back and forth, he scrutinized the traveller.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will dinner be ready soon?” said the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Immediately,” replied the landlord.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the newcomer was warming himself before the fire, with his back\n",
      "turned, the worthy host, Jacquin Labarre, drew a pencil from his\n",
      "pocket, then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on\n",
      "a small table near the window. On the white margin he wrote a line or\n",
      "two, folded it without sealing, and then intrusted this scrap of paper\n",
      "to a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and\n",
      "lackey. The landlord whispered a word in the scullion’s ear, and the\n",
      "child set off on a run in the direction of the town-hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The traveller saw nothing of all this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more he inquired, “Will dinner be ready soon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Immediately,” responded the host.\n",
      "\n",
      "The child returned. He brought back the paper. The host unfolded it\n",
      "eagerly, like a person who is expecting a reply. He seemed to read it\n",
      "attentively, then tossed his head, and remained thoughtful for a\n",
      "moment. Then he took a step in the direction of the traveller, who\n",
      "appeared to be immersed in reflections which were not very serene.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot receive you, sir,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man half rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! Are you afraid that I will not pay you? Do you want me to pay\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have money—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I,” said the host, “have no room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The man resumed tranquilly, “Put me in the stable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The horses take up all the space.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well!” retorted the man; “a corner of the loft then, a truss of\n",
      "straw. We will see about that after dinner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot give you any dinner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This declaration, made in a measured but firm tone, struck the stranger\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The man seated himself again, and said, without raising his voice, “I\n",
      "am at an inn; I am hungry, and I shall remain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the host bent down to his ear, and said in a tone which made him\n",
      "start, “Go away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some\n",
      "brands into the fire with the iron-shod tip of his staff; he turned\n",
      "quickly round, and as he opened his mouth to reply, the host gazed\n",
      "steadily at him and added, still in a low voice: “Stop! there’s enough\n",
      "of that sort of talk. Do you want me to tell you your name? Your name\n",
      "is Jean Valjean. Now do you want me to tell you who you are? When I saw\n",
      "you come in I suspected something; I sent to the town-hall, and this\n",
      "was the reply that was sent to me. Can you read?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he held out to the stranger, fully unfolded, the paper which\n",
      "had just travelled from the inn to the town-hall, and from the\n",
      "town-hall to the inn. The man cast a glance upon it. The landlord\n",
      "resumed after a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am in the habit of being polite to every one. Go away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The man dropped his head, picked up the knapsack which he had deposited\n",
      "on the ground, and took his departure.\n",
      "\n",
      "He chose the principal street. He walked straight on at a venture,\n",
      "keeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man. He did not\n",
      "turn round a single time. Had he done so, he would have seen the host\n",
      "of the _Cross of Colbas_ standing on his threshold, surrounded by all\n",
      "the guests of his inn, and all the passers-by in the street, talking\n",
      "vivaciously, and pointing him out with his finger; and, from the\n",
      "glances of terror and distrust cast by the group, he might have divined\n",
      "that his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw nothing of all this. People who are crushed do not look behind\n",
      "them. They know but too well the evil fate which follows them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus he proceeded for some time, walking on without ceasing, traversing\n",
      "at random streets of which he knew nothing, forgetful of his fatigue,\n",
      "as is often the case when a man is sad. All at once he felt the pangs\n",
      "of hunger sharply. Night was drawing near. He glanced about him, to see\n",
      "whether he could not discover some shelter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fine hostelry was closed to him; he was seeking some very humble\n",
      "public house, some hovel, however lowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets; a pine branch\n",
      "suspended from a cross-beam of iron was outlined against the white sky\n",
      "of the twilight. He proceeded thither.\n",
      "\n",
      "It proved to be, in fact, a public house. The public house which is in\n",
      "the Rue de Chaffaut.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wayfarer halted for a moment, and peeped through the window into\n",
      "the interior of the low-studded room of the public house, illuminated\n",
      "by a small lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth. Some men\n",
      "were engaged in drinking there. The landlord was warming himself. An\n",
      "iron pot, suspended from a crane, bubbled over the flame.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entrance to this public house, which is also a sort of an inn, is\n",
      "by two doors. One opens on the street, the other upon a small yard\n",
      "filled with manure. The traveller dare not enter by the street door. He\n",
      "slipped into the yard, halted again, then raised the latch timidly and\n",
      "opened the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who goes there?” said the master.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some one who wants supper and bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good. We furnish supper and bed here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He entered. All the men who were drinking turned round. The lamp\n",
      "illuminated him on one side, the firelight on the other. They examined\n",
      "him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack.\n",
      "\n",
      "The host said to him, “There is the fire. The supper is cooking in the\n",
      "pot. Come and warm yourself, comrade.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He approached and seated himself near the hearth. He stretched out his\n",
      "feet, which were exhausted with fatigue, to the fire; a fine odor was\n",
      "emitted by the pot. All that could be distinguished of his face,\n",
      "beneath his cap, which was well pulled down, assumed a vague appearance\n",
      "of comfort, mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual\n",
      "suffering bestows.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, moreover, a firm, energetic, and melancholy profile. This\n",
      "physiognomy was strangely composed; it began by seeming humble, and\n",
      "ended by seeming severe. The eye shone beneath its lashes like a fire\n",
      "beneath brushwood.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the men seated at the table, however, was a fishmonger who,\n",
      "before entering the public house of the Rue de Chaffaut, had been to\n",
      "stable his horse at Labarre’s. It chanced that he had that very morning\n",
      "encountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between Bras\n",
      "d’Asse and—I have forgotten the name. I think it was Escoublon. Now,\n",
      "when he met him, the man, who then seemed already extremely weary, had\n",
      "requested him to take him on his crupper; to which the fishmonger had\n",
      "made no reply except by redoubling his gait. This fishmonger had been a\n",
      "member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded Jacquin\n",
      "Labarre, and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the\n",
      "morning to the people at the _Cross of Colbas_. From where he sat he\n",
      "made an imperceptible sign to the tavern-keeper. The tavern-keeper went\n",
      "to him. They exchanged a few words in a low tone. The man had again\n",
      "become absorbed in his reflections.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tavern-keeper returned to the fireplace, laid his hand abruptly on\n",
      "the shoulder of the man, and said to him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are going to get out of here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger turned round and replied gently, “Ah! You know?—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was sent away from the other inn.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you are to be turned out of this one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where would you have me go?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Elsewhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The man took his stick and his knapsack and departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he went out, some children who had followed him from the _Cross of\n",
      "Colbas_, and who seemed to be lying in wait for him, threw stones at\n",
      "him. He retraced his steps in anger, and threatened them with his\n",
      "stick: the children dispersed like a flock of birds.\n",
      "\n",
      "He passed before the prison. At the door hung an iron chain attached to\n",
      "a bell. He rang.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wicket opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Turnkey,” said he, removing his cap politely, “will you have the\n",
      "kindness to admit me, and give me a lodging for the night?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A voice replied:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The prison is not an inn. Get yourself arrested, and you will be\n",
      "admitted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The wicket closed again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He entered a little street in which there were many gardens. Some of\n",
      "them are enclosed only by hedges, which lends a cheerful aspect to the\n",
      "street. In the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a\n",
      "small house of a single story, the window of which was lighted up. He\n",
      "peered through the pane as he had done at the public house. Within was\n",
      "a large whitewashed room, with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff,\n",
      "and a cradle in one corner, a few wooden chairs, and a double-barrelled\n",
      "gun hanging on the wall. A table was spread in the centre of the room.\n",
      "A copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen, the\n",
      "pewter jug shining like silver, and filled with wine, and the brown,\n",
      "smoking soup-tureen. At this table sat a man of about forty, with a\n",
      "merry and open countenance, who was dandling a little child on his\n",
      "knees. Close by a very young woman was nursing another child. The\n",
      "father was laughing, the child was laughing, the mother was smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger paused a moment in reverie before this tender and calming\n",
      "spectacle. What was taking place within him? He alone could have told.\n",
      "It is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be\n",
      "hospitable, and that, in a place where he beheld so much happiness, he\n",
      "would find perhaps a little pity.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not hear him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tapped again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He heard the woman say, “It seems to me, husband, that some one is\n",
      "knocking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” replied the husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tapped a third time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The husband rose, took the lamp, and went to the door, which he opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a man of lofty stature, half peasant, half artisan. He wore a\n",
      "huge leather apron, which reached to his left shoulder, and which a\n",
      "hammer, a red handkerchief, a powder-horn, and all sorts of objects\n",
      "which were upheld by the girdle, as in a pocket, caused to bulge out.\n",
      "He carried his head thrown backwards; his shirt, widely opened and\n",
      "turned back, displayed his bull neck, white and bare. He had thick\n",
      "eyelashes, enormous black whiskers, prominent eyes, the lower part of\n",
      "his face like a snout; and besides all this, that air of being on his\n",
      "own ground, which is indescribable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon me, sir,” said the wayfarer, “Could you, in consideration of\n",
      "payment, give me a plate of soup and a corner of that shed yonder in\n",
      "the garden, in which to sleep? Tell me; can you? For money?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are you?” demanded the master of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man replied: “I have just come from Puy-Moisson. I have walked all\n",
      "day long. I have travelled twelve leagues. Can you?—if I pay?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would not refuse,” said the peasant, “to lodge any respectable man\n",
      "who would pay me. But why do you not go to the inn?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bah! Impossible. This is neither a fair nor a market day. Have you\n",
      "been to Labarre?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The traveller replied with embarrassment: “I do not know. He did not\n",
      "receive me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you been to What’s-his-name’s, in the Rue Chaffaut?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger’s embarrassment increased; he stammered, “He did not\n",
      "receive me either.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The peasant’s countenance assumed an expression of distrust; he\n",
      "surveyed the newcomer from head to feet, and suddenly exclaimed, with a\n",
      "sort of shudder:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you the man?—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He cast a fresh glance upon the stranger, took three steps backwards,\n",
      "placed the lamp on the table, and took his gun down from the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, at the words, _Are you the man?_ the woman had risen, had\n",
      "clasped her two children in her arms, and had taken refuge\n",
      "precipitately behind her husband, staring in terror at the stranger,\n",
      "with her bosom uncovered, and with frightened eyes, as she murmured in\n",
      "a low tone, _“Tso-maraude.”_1\n",
      "\n",
      "All this took place in less time than it requires to picture it to\n",
      "one’s self. After having scrutinized the man for several moments, as\n",
      "one scrutinizes a viper, the master of the house returned to the door\n",
      "and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Clear out!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“For pity’s sake, a glass of water,” said the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A shot from my gun!” said the peasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he closed the door violently, and the man heard him shoot two\n",
      "large bolts. A moment later, the window-shutter was closed, and the\n",
      "sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Night continued to fall. A cold wind from the Alps was blowing. By the\n",
      "light of the expiring day the stranger perceived, in one of the gardens\n",
      "which bordered the street, a sort of hut, which seemed to him to be\n",
      "built of sods. He climbed over the wooden fence resolutely, and found\n",
      "himself in the garden. He approached the hut; its door consisted of a\n",
      "very low and narrow aperture, and it resembled those buildings which\n",
      "road-laborers construct for themselves along the roads. He thought\n",
      "without doubt, that it was, in fact, the dwelling of a road-laborer; he\n",
      "was suffering from cold and hunger, but this was, at least, a shelter\n",
      "from the cold. This sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night.\n",
      "He threw himself flat on his face, and crawled into the hut. It was\n",
      "warm there, and he found a tolerably good bed of straw. He lay, for a\n",
      "moment, stretched out on this bed, without the power to make a\n",
      "movement, so fatigued was he. Then, as the knapsack on his back was in\n",
      "his way, and as it furnished, moreover, a pillow ready to his hand, he\n",
      "set about unbuckling one of the straps. At that moment, a ferocious\n",
      "growl became audible. He raised his eyes. The head of an enormous dog\n",
      "was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a dog’s kennel.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was himself vigorous and formidable; he armed himself with his\n",
      "staff, made a shield of his knapsack, and made his way out of the\n",
      "kennel in the best way he could, not without enlarging the rents in his\n",
      "rags.\n",
      "\n",
      "He left the garden in the same manner, but backwards, being obliged, in\n",
      "order to keep the dog respectful, to have recourse to that manœuvre\n",
      "with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as _la\n",
      "rose couverte_.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had, not without difficulty, repassed the fence, and found\n",
      "himself once more in the street, alone, without refuge, without\n",
      "shelter, without a roof over his head, chased even from that bed of\n",
      "straw and from that miserable kennel, he dropped rather than seated\n",
      "himself on a stone, and it appears that a passer-by heard him exclaim,\n",
      "“I am not even a dog!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He soon rose again and resumed his march. He went out of the town,\n",
      "hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford\n",
      "him shelter.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked thus for some time, with his head still drooping. When he\n",
      "felt himself far from every human habitation, he raised his eyes and\n",
      "gazed searchingly about him. He was in a field. Before him was one of\n",
      "those low hills covered with close-cut stubble, which, after the\n",
      "harvest, resemble shaved heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horizon was perfectly black. This was not alone the obscurity of\n",
      "night; it was caused by very low-hanging clouds which seemed to rest\n",
      "upon the hill itself, and which were mounting and filling the whole\n",
      "sky. Meanwhile, as the moon was about to rise, and as there was still\n",
      "floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight, these\n",
      "clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch, whence a\n",
      "gleam of light fell upon the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The earth was thus better lighted than the sky, which produces a\n",
      "particularly sinister effect, and the hill, whose contour was poor and\n",
      "mean, was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon. The whole\n",
      "effect was hideous, petty, lugubrious, and narrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree,\n",
      "which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer.\n",
      "\n",
      "This man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of\n",
      "intelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious\n",
      "aspects of things; nevertheless, there was something in that sky, in\n",
      "that hill, in that plain, in that tree, which was so profoundly\n",
      "desolate, that after a moment of immobility and reverie he turned back\n",
      "abruptly. There are instants when nature seems hostile.\n",
      "\n",
      "He retraced his steps; the gates of D—— were closed. D——, which had\n",
      "sustained sieges during the wars of religion, was still surrounded in\n",
      "1815 by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have been\n",
      "demolished since. He passed through a breach and entered the town\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might have been eight o’clock in the evening. As he was not\n",
      "acquainted with the streets, he recommenced his walk at random.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this way he came to the prefecture, then to the seminary. As he\n",
      "passed through the Cathedral Square, he shook his fist at the church.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the corner of this square there is a printing establishment. It is\n",
      "there that the proclamations of the Emperor and of the Imperial Guard\n",
      "to the army, brought from the Island of Elba and dictated by Napoleon\n",
      "himself, were printed for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worn out with fatigue, and no longer entertaining any hope, he lay down\n",
      "on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment an old woman came out of the church. She saw the man\n",
      "stretched out in the shadow. “What are you doing there, my friend?”\n",
      "said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered harshly and angrily: “As you see, my good woman, I am\n",
      "sleeping.” The good woman, who was well worthy the name, in fact, was\n",
      "the Marquise de R——\n",
      "\n",
      "“On this bench?” she went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years,” said the man;\n",
      "“to-day I have a mattress of stone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have been a soldier?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give it to me all the same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The man took the four sous. Madame de R—— continued: “You cannot obtain\n",
      "lodgings in an inn for so small a sum. But have you tried? It is\n",
      "impossible for you to pass the night thus. You are cold and hungry, no\n",
      "doubt. Some one might have given you a lodging out of charity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "That evening, the Bishop of D——, after his promenade through the town,\n",
      "remained shut up rather late in his room. He was busy over a great work\n",
      "on _Duties_, which was never completed, unfortunately. He was carefully\n",
      "compiling everything that the Fathers and the doctors have said on this\n",
      "important subject. His book was divided into two parts: firstly, the\n",
      "duties of all; secondly, the duties of each individual, according to\n",
      "the class to which he belongs. The duties of all are the great duties.\n",
      "There are four of these. Saint Matthew points them out: duties towards\n",
      "God (_Matt._ vi.); duties towards one’s self (_Matt._ v. 29, 30);\n",
      "duties towards one’s neighbor (_Matt._ vii. 12); duties towards animals\n",
      "(_Matt._ vi. 20, 25). As for the other duties the Bishop found them\n",
      "pointed out and prescribed elsewhere: to sovereigns and subjects, in\n",
      "the Epistle to the Romans; to magistrates, to wives, to mothers, to\n",
      "young men, by Saint Peter; to husbands, fathers, children and servants,\n",
      "in the Epistle to the Ephesians; to the faithful, in the Epistle to the\n",
      "Hebrews; to virgins, in the Epistle to the Corinthians. Out of these\n",
      "precepts he was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole, which he\n",
      "desired to present to souls.\n",
      "\n",
      "At eight o’clock he was still at work, writing with a good deal of\n",
      "inconvenience upon little squares of paper, with a big book open on his\n",
      "knees, when Madame Magloire entered, according to her wont, to get the\n",
      "silver-ware from the cupboard near his bed. A moment later, the Bishop,\n",
      "knowing that the table was set, and that his sister was probably\n",
      "waiting for him, shut his book, rose from his table, and entered the\n",
      "dining-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dining-room was an oblong apartment, with a fireplace, which had a\n",
      "door opening on the street (as we have said), and a window opening on\n",
      "the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Magloire was, in fact, just putting the last touches to the\n",
      "table.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she performed this service, she was conversing with Mademoiselle\n",
      "Baptistine.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lamp stood on the table; the table was near the fireplace. A wood\n",
      "fire was burning there.\n",
      "\n",
      "One can easily picture to one’s self these two women, both of whom were\n",
      "over sixty years of age. Madame Magloire small, plump, vivacious;\n",
      "Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle, slender, frail, somewhat taller than\n",
      "her brother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of\n",
      "1806, which she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which had\n",
      "lasted ever since. To borrow vulgar phrases, which possess the merit of\n",
      "giving utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would\n",
      "hardly suffice to express, Madame Magloire had the air of a _peasant_,\n",
      "and Mademoiselle Baptistine that of a _lady_. Madame Magloire wore a\n",
      "white quilted cap, a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her\n",
      "neck, the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house, a\n",
      "very white fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff,\n",
      "with large, short sleeves, an apron of cotton cloth in red and green\n",
      "checks, knotted round the waist with a green ribbon, with a stomacher\n",
      "of the same attached by two pins at the upper corners, coarse shoes on\n",
      "her feet, and yellow stockings, like the women of Marseilles.\n",
      "Mademoiselle Baptistine’s gown was cut on the patterns of 1806, with a\n",
      "short waist, a narrow, sheath-like skirt, puffed sleeves, with flaps\n",
      "and buttons. She concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as\n",
      "the _baby_ wig. Madame Magloire had an intelligent, vivacious, and\n",
      "kindly air; the two corners of her mouth unequally raised, and her\n",
      "upper lip, which was larger than the lower, imparted to her a rather\n",
      "crabbed and imperious look. So long as Monseigneur held his peace, she\n",
      "talked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom; but as\n",
      "soon as Monseigneur began to speak, as we have seen, she obeyed\n",
      "passively like her mistress. Mademoiselle Baptistine did not even\n",
      "speak. She confined herself to obeying and pleasing him. She had never\n",
      "been pretty, even when she was young; she had large, blue, prominent\n",
      "eyes, and a long arched nose; but her whole visage, her whole person,\n",
      "breathed forth an ineffable goodness, as we stated in the beginning.\n",
      "She had always been predestined to gentleness; but faith, charity,\n",
      "hope, those three virtues which mildly warm the soul, had gradually\n",
      "elevated that gentleness to sanctity. Nature had made her a lamb,\n",
      "religion had made her an angel. Poor sainted virgin! Sweet memory which\n",
      "has vanished!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mademoiselle Baptistine has so often narrated what passed at the\n",
      "episcopal residence that evening, that there are many people now living\n",
      "who still recall the most minute details.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment when the Bishop entered, Madame Magloire was talking with\n",
      "considerable vivacity. She was haranguing Mademoiselle Baptistine on a\n",
      "subject which was familiar to her and to which the Bishop was also\n",
      "accustomed. The question concerned the lock upon the entrance door.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appears that while procuring some provisions for supper, Madame\n",
      "Magloire had heard things in divers places. People had spoken of a\n",
      "prowler of evil appearance; a suspicious vagabond had arrived who must\n",
      "be somewhere about the town, and those who should take it into their\n",
      "heads to return home late that night might be subjected to unpleasant\n",
      "encounters. The police was very badly organized, moreover, because\n",
      "there was no love lost between the Prefect and the Mayor, who sought to\n",
      "injure each other by making things happen. It behooved wise people to\n",
      "play the part of their own police, and to guard themselves well, and\n",
      "care must be taken to duly close, bar and barricade their houses, and\n",
      "to _fasten the doors well_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Magloire emphasized these last words; but the Bishop had just\n",
      "come from his room, where it was rather cold. He seated himself in\n",
      "front of the fire, and warmed himself, and then fell to thinking of\n",
      "other things. He did not take up the remark dropped with design by\n",
      "Madame Magloire. She repeated it. Then Mademoiselle Baptistine,\n",
      "desirous of satisfying Madame Magloire without displeasing her brother,\n",
      "ventured to say timidly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you hear what Madame Magloire is saying, brother?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have heard something of it in a vague way,” replied the Bishop. Then\n",
      "half-turning in his chair, placing his hands on his knees, and raising\n",
      "towards the old servant woman his cordial face, which so easily grew\n",
      "joyous, and which was illuminated from below by the firelight,—“Come,\n",
      "what is the matter? What is the matter? Are we in any great danger?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Madame Magloire began the whole story afresh, exaggerating it a\n",
      "little without being aware of the fact. It appeared that a Bohemian, a\n",
      "bare-footed vagabond, a sort of dangerous mendicant, was at that moment\n",
      "in the town. He had presented himself at Jacquin Labarre’s to obtain\n",
      "lodgings, but the latter had not been willing to take him in. He had\n",
      "been seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard Gassendi and roam about\n",
      "the streets in the gloaming. A gallows-bird with a terrible face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really!” said the Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "This willingness to interrogate encouraged Madame Magloire; it seemed\n",
      "to her to indicate that the Bishop was on the point of becoming\n",
      "alarmed; she pursued triumphantly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Monseigneur. That is how it is. There will be some sort of\n",
      "catastrophe in this town to-night. Every one says so. And withal, the\n",
      "police is so badly regulated” (a useful repetition). “The idea of\n",
      "living in a mountainous country, and not even having lights in the\n",
      "streets at night! One goes out. Black as ovens, indeed! And I say,\n",
      "Monseigneur, and Mademoiselle there says with me—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I,” interrupted his sister, “say nothing. What my brother does is well\n",
      "done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Magloire continued as though there had been no protest:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“We say that this house is not safe at all; that if Monseigneur will\n",
      "permit, I will go and tell Paulin Musebois, the locksmith, to come and\n",
      "replace the ancient locks on the doors; we have them, and it is only\n",
      "the work of a moment; for I say that nothing is more terrible than a\n",
      "door which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first\n",
      "passer-by; and I say that we need bolts, Monseigneur, if only for this\n",
      "night; moreover, Monseigneur has the habit of always saying ‘come in’;\n",
      "and besides, even in the middle of the night, O mon Dieu! there is no\n",
      "need to ask permission.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come in,” said the Bishop.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The door opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "It opened wide with a rapid movement, as though some one had given it\n",
      "an energetic and resolute push.\n",
      "\n",
      "A man entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "We already know the man. It was the wayfarer whom we have seen\n",
      "wandering about in search of shelter.\n",
      "\n",
      "He entered, advanced a step, and halted, leaving the door open behind\n",
      "him. He had his knapsack on his shoulders, his cudgel in his hand, a\n",
      "rough, audacious, weary, and violent expression in his eyes. The fire\n",
      "on the hearth lighted him up. He was hideous. It was a sinister\n",
      "apparition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry. She trembled,\n",
      "and stood with her mouth wide open.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mademoiselle Baptistine turned round, beheld the man entering, and half\n",
      "started up in terror; then, turning her head by degrees towards the\n",
      "fireplace again, she began to observe her brother, and her face became\n",
      "once more profoundly calm and serene.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he opened his mouth, doubtless to ask the newcomer what he desired,\n",
      "the man rested both hands on his staff, directed his gaze at the old\n",
      "man and the two women, and without waiting for the Bishop to speak, he\n",
      "said, in a loud voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“See here. My name is Jean Valjean. I am a convict from the galleys. I\n",
      "have passed nineteen years in the galleys. I was liberated four days\n",
      "ago, and am on my way to Pontarlier, which is my destination. I have\n",
      "been walking for four days since I left Toulon. I have travelled a\n",
      "dozen leagues to-day on foot. This evening, when I arrived in these\n",
      "parts, I went to an inn, and they turned me out, because of my yellow\n",
      "passport, which I had shown at the town-hall. I had to do it. I went to\n",
      "an inn. They said to me, ‘Be off,’ at both places. No one would take\n",
      "me. I went to the prison; the jailer would not admit me. I went into a\n",
      "dog’s kennel; the dog bit me and chased me off, as though he had been a\n",
      "man. One would have said that he knew who I was. I went into the\n",
      "fields, intending to sleep in the open air, beneath the stars. There\n",
      "were no stars. I thought it was going to rain, and I re-entered the\n",
      "town, to seek the recess of a doorway. Yonder, in the square, I meant\n",
      "to sleep on a stone bench. A good woman pointed out your house to me,\n",
      "and said to me, ‘Knock there!’ I have knocked. What is this place? Do\n",
      "you keep an inn? I have money—savings. One hundred and nine francs\n",
      "fifteen sous, which I earned in the galleys by my labor, in the course\n",
      "of nineteen years. I will pay. What is that to me? I have money. I am\n",
      "very weary; twelve leagues on foot; I am very hungry. Are you willing\n",
      "that I should remain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Madame Magloire,” said the Bishop, “you will set another place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The man advanced three paces, and approached the lamp which was on the\n",
      "table. “Stop,” he resumed, as though he had not quite understood;\n",
      "“that’s not it. Did you hear? I am a galley-slave; a convict. I come\n",
      "from the galleys.” He drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellow\n",
      "paper, which he unfolded. “Here’s my passport. Yellow, as you see. This\n",
      "serves to expel me from every place where I go. Will you read it? I\n",
      "know how to read. I learned in the galleys. There is a school there for\n",
      "those who choose to learn. Hold, this is what they put on this\n",
      "passport: ‘Jean Valjean, discharged convict, native of’—that is nothing\n",
      "to you—‘has been nineteen years in the galleys: five years for\n",
      "house-breaking and burglary; fourteen years for having attempted to\n",
      "escape on four occasions. He is a very dangerous man.’ There! Every one\n",
      "has cast me out. Are you willing to receive me? Is this an inn? Will\n",
      "you give me something to eat and a bed? Have you a stable?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Madame Magloire,” said the Bishop, “you will put white sheets on the\n",
      "bed in the alcove.” We have already explained the character of the two\n",
      "women’s obedience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Magloire retired to execute these orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop turned to the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sit down, sir, and warm yourself. We are going to sup in a few\n",
      "moments, and your bed will be prepared while you are supping.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point the man suddenly comprehended. The expression of his\n",
      "face, up to that time sombre and harsh, bore the imprint of\n",
      "stupefaction, of doubt, of joy, and became extraordinary. He began\n",
      "stammering like a crazy man:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really? What! You will keep me? You do not drive me forth? A convict!\n",
      "You call me _sir!_ You do not address me as _thou?_ ‘Get out of here,\n",
      "you dog!’ is what people always say to me. I felt sure that you would\n",
      "expel me, so I told you at once who I am. Oh, what a good woman that\n",
      "was who directed me hither! I am going to sup! A bed with a mattress\n",
      "and sheets, like the rest of the world! a bed! It is nineteen years\n",
      "since I have slept in a bed! You actually do not want me to go! You are\n",
      "good people. Besides, I have money. I will pay well. Pardon me,\n",
      "monsieur the inn-keeper, but what is your name? I will pay anything you\n",
      "ask. You are a fine man. You are an inn-keeper, are you not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am,” replied the Bishop, “a priest who lives here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“A priest!” said the man. “Oh, what a fine priest! Then you are not\n",
      "going to demand any money of me? You are the curé, are you not? the\n",
      "curé of this big church? Well! I am a fool, truly! I had not perceived\n",
      "your skull-cap.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke, he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner,\n",
      "replaced his passport in his pocket, and seated himself. Mademoiselle\n",
      "Baptistine gazed mildly at him. He continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are humane, Monsieur le Curé; you have not scorned me. A good\n",
      "priest is a very good thing. Then you do not require me to pay?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the Bishop; “keep your money. How much have you? Did you not\n",
      "tell me one hundred and nine francs?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And fifteen sous,” added the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One hundred and nine francs fifteen sous. And how long did it take you\n",
      "to earn that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nineteen years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nineteen years!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop sighed deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man continued: “I have still the whole of my money. In four days I\n",
      "have spent only twenty-five sous, which I earned by helping unload some\n",
      "wagons at Grasse. Since you are an abbé, I will tell you that we had a\n",
      "chaplain in the galleys. And one day I saw a bishop there. Monseigneur\n",
      "is what they call him. He was the Bishop of Majore at Marseilles. He is\n",
      "the curé who rules over the other curés, you understand. Pardon me, I\n",
      "say that very badly; but it is such a far-off thing to me! You\n",
      "understand what we are! He said mass in the middle of the galleys, on\n",
      "an altar. He had a pointed thing, made of gold, on his head; it\n",
      "glittered in the bright light of midday. We were all ranged in lines on\n",
      "the three sides, with cannons with lighted matches facing us. We could\n",
      "not see very well. He spoke; but he was too far off, and we did not\n",
      "hear. That is what a bishop is like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was speaking, the Bishop had gone and shut the door, which had\n",
      "remained wide open.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Magloire returned. She brought a silver fork and spoon, which\n",
      "she placed on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Madame Magloire,” said the Bishop, “place those things as near the\n",
      "fire as possible.” And turning to his guest: “The night wind is harsh\n",
      "on the Alps. You must be cold, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Each time that he uttered the word _sir_, in his voice which was so\n",
      "gently grave and polished, the man’s face lighted up. _Monsieur_ to a\n",
      "convict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the\n",
      "_Medusa_. Ignominy thirsts for consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This lamp gives a very bad light,” said the Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Magloire understood him, and went to get the two silver\n",
      "candlesticks from the chimney-piece in Monseigneur’s bed-chamber, and\n",
      "placed them, lighted, on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur le Curé,” said the man, “you are good; you do not despise me.\n",
      "You receive me into your house. You light your candles for me. Yet I\n",
      "have not concealed from you whence I come and that I am an unfortunate\n",
      "man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop, who was sitting close to him, gently touched his hand. “You\n",
      "could not help telling me who you were. This is not my house; it is the\n",
      "house of Jesus Christ. This door does not demand of him who enters\n",
      "whether he has a name, but whether he has a grief. You suffer, you are\n",
      "hungry and thirsty; you are welcome. And do not thank me; do not say\n",
      "that I receive you in my house. No one is at home here, except the man\n",
      "who needs a refuge. I say to you, who are passing by, that you are much\n",
      "more at home here than I am myself. Everything here is yours. What need\n",
      "have I to know your name? Besides, before you told me you had one which\n",
      "I knew.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, the red coat, the ball on the ankle, a plank to sleep on, heat,\n",
      "cold, toil, the convicts, the thrashings, the double chain for nothing,\n",
      "the cell for one word; even sick and in bed, still the chain! Dogs,\n",

      "Listen. There will be more joy in heaven over the tear-bathed face of a\n",
      "repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men. If\n",
      "you emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath\n",

      "In the meantime, Madame Magloire had served supper: soup, made with\n",
      "water, oil, bread, and salt; a little bacon, a bit of mutton, figs, a\n",
      "fresh cheese, and a large loaf of rye bread. She had, of her own\n",

      "wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop’s face at once assumed that expression of gayety which is\n",
      "peculiar to hospitable natures. “To table!” he cried vivaciously. As\n",
      "was his custom when a stranger supped with him, he made the man sit on\n",

      "took her seat at his left.\n",

      "sets of silver on the table-cloth—an innocent ostentation. This\n",

      "\n",
      "“‘With my road marked out for me.’\n",

      "nights are cold, the days are hot.’\n",

      "“‘You are going to a good country,’ said my brother. ‘During the\n",
      "Revolution my family was ruined. I took refuge in Franche-Comté at\n",
      "first, and there I lived for some time by the toil of my hands. My will\n",
      "was good. I found plenty to occupy me. One has only to choose. There\n",
      "are paper mills, tanneries, distilleries, oil factories, watch\n",
      "factories on a large scale, steel mills, copper works, twenty iron\n",

      "gates at Pontarlier under the old régime.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Yes,’ resumed my brother; ‘but in ’93, one had no longer any\n",
      "relatives, one had only one’s arms. I worked. They have, in the country\n",
      "of Pontarlier, whither you are going, Monsieur Valjean, a truly\n",
      "patriarchal and truly charming industry, my sister. It is their\n",
      "cheese-dairies, which they call _fruitières_.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then my brother, while urging the man to eat, explained to him, with\n",
      "great minuteness, what these _fruitières_ of Pontarlier were; that they\n",
      "were divided into two classes: the _big barns_ which belong to the\n",
      "rich, and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from seven\n",
      "to eight thousand cheeses each summer, and the _associated fruitières_,\n",
      "which belong to the poor; these are the peasants of mid-mountain, who\n",
      "hold their cows in common, and share the proceeds. ‘They engage the\n",
      "services of a cheese-maker, whom they call the _grurin_; the _grurin_\n",
      "receives the milk of the associates three times a day, and marks the\n",
      "quantity on a double tally. It is towards the end of April that the\n",
      "work of the cheese-dairies begins; it is towards the middle of June\n",
      "that the cheese-makers drive their cows to the mountains.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“The man recovered his animation as he ate. My brother made him drink\n",
      "that good Mauves wine, which he does not drink himself, because he says\n",
      "that wine is expensive. My brother imparted all these details with that\n",
      "easy gayety of his with which you are acquainted, interspersing his\n",
      "words with graceful attentions to me. He recurred frequently to that\n",
      "comfortable trade of _grurin_, as though he wished the man to\n",
      "understand, without advising him directly and harshly, that this would\n",
      "afford him a refuge. One thing struck me. This man was what I have told\n",
      "you. Well, neither during supper, nor during the entire evening, did my\n",
      "brother utter a single word, with the exception of a few words about\n",
      "Jesus when he entered, which could remind the man of what he was, nor\n",
      "of what my brother was. To all appearances, it was an occasion for\n",
      "preaching him a little sermon, and of impressing the Bishop on the\n",
      "convict, so that a mark of the passage might remain behind. This might\n",
      "have appeared to any one else who had this, unfortunate man in his\n",
      "hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul as well as his body, and\n",
      "to bestow upon him some reproach, seasoned with moralizing and advice,\n",
      "or a little commiseration, with an exhortation to conduct himself\n",
      "better in the future. My brother did not even ask him from what country\n",
      "he came, nor what was his history. For in his history there is a fault,\n",
      "and my brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it.\n",
      "To such a point did he carry it, that at one time, when my brother was\n",
      "speaking of the mountaineers of Pontarlier, _who exercise a gentle\n",
      "labor near heaven, and who_, he added, _are happy because they are\n",
      "innocent_, he stopped short, fearing lest in this remark there might\n",
      "have escaped him something which might wound the man. By dint of\n",
      "reflection, I think I have comprehended what was passing in my\n",
      "brother’s heart. He was thinking, no doubt, that this man, whose name\n",
      "is Jean Valjean, had his misfortune only too vividly present in his\n",
      "mind; that the best thing was to divert him from it, and to make him\n",
      "believe, if only momentarily, that he was a person like any other, by\n",
      "treating him just in his ordinary way. Is not this indeed, to\n",
      "understand charity well? Is there not, dear Madame, something truly\n",
      "evangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon, from\n",
      "moralizing, from allusions? and is not the truest pity, when a man has\n",
      "a sore point, not to touch it at all? It has seemed to me that this\n",
      "might have been my brother’s private thought. In any case, what I can\n",
      "say is that, if he entertained all these ideas, he gave no sign of\n",
      "them; from beginning to end, even to me he was the same as he is every\n",
      "evening, and he supped with this Jean Valjean with the same air and in\n",
      "the same manner in which he would have supped with M. Gédéon le\n",
      "Prévost, or with the curate of the parish.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Towards the end, when he had reached the figs, there came a knock at\n",
      "the door. It was Mother Gerbaud, with her little one in her arms. My\n",
      "brother kissed the child on the brow, and borrowed fifteen sous which I\n",
      "had about me to give to Mother Gerbaud. The man was not paying much\n",
      "heed to anything then. He was no longer talking, and he seemed very\n",
      "much fatigued. After poor old Gerbaud had taken her departure, my\n",
      "brother said grace; then he turned to the man and said to him, ‘You\n",
      "must be in great need of your bed.’ Madame Magloire cleared the table\n",
      "very promptly. I understood that we must retire, in order to allow this\n",
      "traveller to go to sleep, and we both went upstairs. Nevertheless, I\n",
      "sent Madame Magloire down a moment later, to carry to the man’s bed a\n",
      "goat skin from the Black Forest, which was in my room. The nights are\n",
      "frigid, and that keeps one warm. It is a pity that this skin is old;\n",
      "all the hair is falling out. My brother bought it while he was in\n",

      "little ivory-handled knife which I use at table.\n",
      "\n",

      "Towards the middle of the night Jean Valjean woke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean came from a poor peasant family of Brie. He had not\n",
      "learned to read in his childhood. When he reached man’s estate, he\n",
      "became a tree-pruner at Faverolles. His mother was named Jeanne\n",
      "Mathieu; his father was called Jean Valjean or Vlajean, probably a\n",
      "sobriquet, and a contraction of _voilà_ Jean, “here’s Jean.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which\n",
      "constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures. On the whole,\n",
      "however, there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant about\n",
      "Jean Valjean in appearance, at least. He had lost his father and mother\n",
      "at a very early age. His mother had died of a milk fever, which had not\n",
      "been properly attended to. His father, a tree-pruner, like himself, had\n",
      "been killed by a fall from a tree. All that remained to Jean Valjean\n",
      "was a sister older than himself,—a widow with seven children, boys and\n",
      "girls. This sister had brought up Jean Valjean, and so long as she had\n",
      "a husband she lodged and fed her young brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "The husband died. The eldest of the seven children was eight years old.\n",
      "The youngest, one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean had just attained his twenty-fifth year. He took the\n",
      "father’s place, and, in his turn, supported the sister who had brought\n",
      "him up. This was done simply as a duty and even a little churlishly on\n",
      "the part of Jean Valjean. Thus his youth had been spent in rude and\n",
      "ill-paid toil. He had never known a “kind woman friend” in his native\n",
      "parts. He had not had the time to fall in love.\n",
      "\n",
      "He returned at night weary, and ate his broth without uttering a word.\n",
      "His sister, mother Jeanne, often took the best part of his repast from\n",
      "his bowl while he was eating,—a bit of meat, a slice of bacon, the\n",
      "heart of the cabbage,—to give to one of her children. As he went on\n",
      "eating, with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup, his\n",
      "long hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes, he had the\n",
      "air of perceiving nothing and allowing it. There was at Faverolles, not\n",
      "far from the Valjean thatched cottage, on the other side of the lane, a\n",
      "farmer’s wife named Marie-Claude; the Valjean children, habitually\n",
      "famished, sometimes went to borrow from Marie-Claude a pint of milk, in\n",
      "their mother’s name, which they drank behind a hedge or in some alley\n",
      "corner, snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the little\n",
      "girls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks. If their mother\n",
      "had known of this marauding, she would have punished the delinquents\n",
      "severely. Jean Valjean gruffly and grumblingly paid Marie-Claude for\n",
      "the pint of milk behind their mother’s back, and the children were not\n",
      "punished.\n",
      "\n",
      "In pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day; then he hired out as a\n",
      "hay-maker, as laborer, as neat-herd on a farm, as a drudge. He did\n",
      "whatever he could. His sister worked also but what could she do with\n",
      "seven little children? It was a sad group enveloped in misery, which\n",
      "was being gradually annihilated. A very hard winter came. Jean had no\n",
      "work. The family had no bread. No bread literally. Seven children!\n",
      "\n",
      "One Sunday evening, Maubert Isabeau, the baker on the Church Square at\n",
      "Faverolles, was preparing to go to bed, when he heard a violent blow on\n",
      "the grated front of his shop. He arrived in time to see an arm passed\n",
      "through a hole made by a blow from a fist, through the grating and the\n",
      "glass. The arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off. Isabeau ran\n",
      "out in haste; the robber fled at the full speed of his legs. Isabeau\n",
      "ran after him and stopped him. The thief had flung away the loaf, but\n",
      "his arm was still bleeding. It was Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "This took place in 1795. Jean Valjean was taken before the tribunals of\n",
      "the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at\n",
      "night. He had a gun which he used better than any one else in the\n",
      "world, he was a bit of a poacher, and this injured his case. There\n",
      "exists a legitimate prejudice against poachers. The poacher, like the\n",
      "smuggler, smacks too strongly of the brigand. Nevertheless, we will\n",
      "remark cursorily, there is still an abyss between these races of men\n",
      "and the hideous assassin of the towns. The poacher lives in the forest,\n",
      "the smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea. The cities make\n",
      "ferocious men because they make corrupt men. The mountain, the sea, the\n",
      "forest, make savage men; they develop the fierce side, but often\n",
      "without destroying the humane side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty. The terms of the Code were\n",
      "explicit. There occur formidable hours in our civilization; there are\n",
      "moments when the penal laws decree a shipwreck. What an ominous minute\n",
      "is that in which society draws back and consummates the irreparable\n",
      "abandonment of a sentient being! Jean Valjean was condemned to five\n",
      "years in the galleys.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the 22d of April, 1796, the victory of Montenotte, won by the\n",
      "general-in-chief of the army of Italy, whom the message of the\n",
      "Directory to the Five Hundred, of the 2d of Floréal, year IV., calls\n",
      "Buona-Parte, was announced in Paris; on that same day a great gang of\n",
      "galley-slaves was put in chains at Bicêtre. Jean Valjean formed a part\n",
      "of that gang. An old turnkey of the prison, who is now nearly eighty\n",
      "years old, still recalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was\n",
      "chained to the end of the fourth line, in the north angle of the\n",

      "to comprehend his position, except that it was horrible. It is probable\n",
      "that he, also, was disentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor\n",
      "man, ignorant of everything, something excessive. While the bolt of his\n",
      "iron collar was being riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the\n",
      "hammer, he wept, his tears stifled him, they impeded his speech; he\n",
      "only managed to say from time to time, “I was a tree-pruner at\n",
      "Faverolles.” Then still sobbing, he raised his right hand and lowered\n",
      "it gradually seven times, as though he were touching in succession\n",
      "seven heads of unequal heights, and from this gesture it was divined\n",
      "that the thing which he had done, whatever it was, he had done for the\n",
      "sake of clothing and nourishing seven little children.\n",
      "\n",
      "He set out for Toulon. He arrived there, after a journey of\n",
      "twenty-seven days, on a cart, with a chain on his neck. At Toulon he\n",
      "was clothed in the red cassock. All that had constituted his life, even\n",
      "to his name, was effaced; he was no longer even Jean Valjean; he was\n",
      "number 24,601. What became of his sister? What became of the seven\n",
      "children? Who troubled himself about that? What becomes of the handful\n",
      "of leaves from the young tree which is sawed off at the root?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is always the same story. These poor living beings, these creatures\n",
      "of God, henceforth without support, without guide, without refuge,\n",
      "wandered away at random,—who even knows?—each in his own direction\n",
      "perhaps, and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist which\n",
      "engulfs solitary destinies; gloomy shades, into which disappear in\n",
      "succession so many unlucky heads, in the sombre march of the human\n",
      "race. They quitted the country. The clock-tower of what had been their\n",
      "village forgot them; the boundary line of what had been their field\n",
      "forgot them; after a few years’ residence in the galleys, Jean Valjean\n",
      "himself forgot them. In that heart, where there had been a wound, there\n",
      "was a scar. That is all. Only once, during all the time which he spent\n",
      "at Toulon, did he hear his sister mentioned. This happened, I think,\n",
      "towards the end of the fourth year of his captivity. I know not through\n",
      "what channels the news reached him. Some one who had known them in\n",
      "their own country had seen his sister. She was in Paris. She lived in a\n",
      "poor street near Saint-Sulpice, in the Rue du Gindre. She had with her\n",
      "only one child, a little boy, the youngest. Where were the other six?\n",
      "Perhaps she did not know herself. Every morning she went to a printing\n",
      "office, No. 3 Rue du Sabot, where she was a folder and stitcher. She\n",
      "was obliged to be there at six o’clock in the morning—long before\n",
      "daylight in winter. In the same building with the printing office there\n",
      "was a school, and to this school she took her little boy, who was seven\n",
      "years old. But as she entered the printing office at six, and the\n",
      "school only opened at seven, the child had to wait in the courtyard,\n",
      "for the school to open, for an hour—one hour of a winter night in the\n",
      "open air! They would not allow the child to come into the printing\n",
      "office, because he was in the way, they said. When the workmen passed\n",
      "in the morning, they beheld this poor little being seated on the\n",
      "pavement, overcome with drowsiness, and often fast asleep in the\n",
      "shadow, crouched down and doubled up over his basket. When it rained,\n",
      "an old woman, the portress, took pity on him; she took him into her\n",
      "den, where there was a pallet, a spinning-wheel, and two wooden chairs,\n",
      "and the little one slumbered in a corner, pressing himself close to the\n",
      "cat that he might suffer less from cold. At seven o’clock the school\n",
      "opened, and he entered. That is what was told to Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked to him about it for one day; it was a moment, a flash, as\n",
      "though a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of those\n",
      "things whom he had loved; then all closed again. He heard nothing more\n",
      "forever. Nothing from them ever reached him again; he never beheld\n",
      "them; he never met them again; and in the continuation of this mournful\n",
      "history they will not be met with any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the end of this fourth year Jean Valjean’s turn to escape\n",
      "arrived. His comrades assisted him, as is the custom in that sad place.\n",
      "He escaped. He wandered for two days in the fields at liberty, if being\n",
      "at liberty is to be hunted, to turn the head every instant, to quake at\n",
      "the slightest noise, to be afraid of everything,—of a smoking roof, of\n",
      "a passing man, of a barking dog, of a galloping horse, of a striking\n",
      "clock, of the day because one can see, of the night because one cannot\n",
      "see, of the highway, of the path, of a bush, of sleep. On the evening\n",
      "of the second day he was captured. He had neither eaten nor slept for\n",
      "thirty-six hours. The maritime tribunal condemned him, for this crime,\n",
      "to a prolongation of his term for three years, which made eight years.\n",
      "In the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again; he availed himself\n",
      "of it, but could not accomplish his flight fully. He was missing at\n",
      "roll-call. The cannon were fired, and at night the patrol found him\n",
      "hidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction; he\n",
      "resisted the galley guards who seized him. Escape and rebellion. This\n",
      "case, provided for by a special code, was punished by an addition of\n",
      "five years, two of them in the double chain. Thirteen years. In the\n",
      "tenth year his turn came round again; he again profited by it; he\n",
      "succeeded no better. Three years for this fresh attempt. Sixteen years.\n",
      "Finally, I think it was during his thirteenth year, he made a last\n",
      "attempt, and only succeeded in getting retaken at the end of four hours\n",
      "of absence. Three years for those four hours. Nineteen years. In\n",

      "itself which creates them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was, as we have said, an ignorant man, but he was not a fool. The\n",
      "light of nature was ignited in him. Unhappiness, which also possesses a\n",
      "clearness of vision of its own, augmented the small amount of daylight\n",
      "which existed in this mind. Beneath the cudgel, beneath the chain, in\n",
      "the cell, in hardship, beneath the burning sun of the galleys, upon the\n",
      "plank bed of the convict, he withdrew into his own consciousness and\n",
      "meditated.\n",
      "\n",
      "He constituted himself the tribunal.\n",
      "\n",
      "He began by putting himself on trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "He recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly\n",
      "punished. He admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthy\n",
      "act; that that loaf of bread would probably not have been refused to\n",
      "him had he asked for it; that, in any case, it would have been better\n",
      "to wait until he could get it through compassion or through work; that\n",
      "it is not an unanswerable argument to say, “Can one wait when one is\n",
      "hungry?” That, in the first place, it is very rare for any one to die\n",
      "of hunger, literally; and next, that, fortunately or unfortunately, man\n",
      "is so constituted that he can suffer long and much, both morally and\n",
      "physically, without dying; that it is therefore necessary to have\n",
      "patience; that that would even have been better for those poor little\n",
      "children; that it had been an act of madness for him, a miserable,\n",
      "unfortunate wretch, to take society at large violently by the collar,\n",
      "and to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft; that that\n",
      "is in any case a poor door through which to escape from misery through\n",
      "which infamy enters; in short, that he was in the wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he asked himself:—\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history. Whether\n",
      "it was not a serious thing, that he, a laborer, out of work, that he,\n",
      "an industrious man, should have lacked bread. And whether, the fault\n",
      "once committed and confessed, the chastisement had not been ferocious\n",
      "and disproportioned. Whether there had not been more abuse on the part\n",
      "of the law, in respect to the penalty, than there had been on the part\n",
      "of the culprit in respect to his fault. Whether there had not been an\n",
      "excess of weights in one balance of the scale, in the one which\n",
      "contains expiation. Whether the over-weight of the penalty was not\n",
      "equivalent to the annihilation of the crime, and did not result in\n",
      "reversing the situation, of replacing the fault of the delinquent by\n",
      "the fault of the repression, of converting the guilty man into the\n",
      "victim, and the debtor into the creditor, and of ranging the law\n",
      "definitely on the side of the man who had violated it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether this penalty, complicated by successive aggravations for\n",
      "attempts at escape, had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage\n",
      "perpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler, a crime of society\n",
      "against the individual, a crime which was being committed afresh every\n",
      "day, a crime which had lasted nineteen years.\n",
      "\n",
      "He asked himself whether human society could have the right to force\n",
      "its members to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lack\n",
      "of foresight, and in the other case for its pitiless foresight; and to\n",
      "seize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess, a default of\n",
      "work and an excess of punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it was not outrageous for society to treat thus precisely those\n",
      "of its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goods\n",
      "made by chance, and consequently the most deserving of consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "These questions put and answered, he judged society and condemned it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He condemned it to his hatred.\n",
      "\n",
      "He made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering, and he said\n",
      "to himself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to call\n",
      "it to account. He declared to himself that there was no equilibrium\n",
      "between the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done\n",
      "to him; he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was\n",
      "not, in truth, unjust, but that it most assuredly was iniquitous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anger may be both foolish and absurd; one can be irritated wrongfully;\n",
      "one is exasperated only when there is some show of right on one’s side\n",
      "at bottom. Jean Valjean felt himself exasperated.\n",
      "\n",

      "seen anything of it save that angry face which it calls Justice, and\n",
      "which it shows to those whom it strikes. Men had only touched him to\n",
      "bruise him. Every contact with them had been a blow. Never, since his\n",
      "infancy, since the days of his mother, of his sister, had he ever\n",
      "encountered a friendly word and a kindly glance. From suffering to\n",
      "suffering, he had gradually arrived at the conviction that life is a\n",
      "war; and that in this war he was the conquered. He had no other weapon\n",

      "mind. He went to school at the age of forty, and learned to read, to\n",
      "write, to cipher. He felt that to fortify his intelligence was to\n",

      "system of mysterious statics is daily practised by prisoners, men who\n",
      "are forever envious of the flies and birds. To climb a vertical\n",
      "surface, and to find points of support where hardly a projection was\n",

      "with the tension of his back and legs, with his elbows and his heels\n",
      "fitted into the unevenness of the stone, he raised himself as if by\n",

      "He was absorbed, in fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed\n",

      "each time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance, he\n",
      "perceived with terror, mingled with rage, a sort of frightful\n",
      "accumulation of things, collecting and mounting above him, beyond the\n",
      "range of his vision,—laws, prejudices, men, and deeds,—whose outlines\n",
      "escaped him, whose mass terrified him, and which was nothing else than\n",
      "that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization. He distinguished,\n",
      "here and there in that swarming and formless mass, now near him, now\n",

      "And this was encompassed with much bitterness. He had calculated that\n",

      "hundred and seventy-one francs. It is but just to add that he had\n",
      "forgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of Sundays\n",

      "\n",
      "What woke him was that his bed was too good. It was nearly twenty years\n",
      "since he had slept in a bed, and, although he had not undressed, the\n",
      "sensation was too novel not to disturb his slumbers.\n",

      "When many varied sensations have agitated the day, when various matters\n",

      "Valjean. He could not get to sleep again, and he fell to thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in one’s\n",
      "mind are troubled. There was a sort of dark confusion in his brain. His\n",
      "memories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there\n",
      "pell-mell and mingled confusedly, losing their proper forms, becoming\n",
      "disproportionately large, then suddenly disappearing, as in a muddy and\n",
      "perturbed pool. Many thoughts occurred to him; but there was one which\n",
      "kept constantly presenting itself afresh, and which drove away all\n",
      "others. We will mention this thought at once: he had observed the six\n",
      "sets of silver forks and spoons and the ladle which Madame Magloire had\n",
      "placed on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those six sets of silver haunted him.—They were there.—A few paces\n",
      "distant.—Just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach the one\n",
      "in which he then was, the old servant-woman had been in the act of\n",
      "placing them in a little cupboard near the head of the bed.—He had\n",
      "taken careful note of this cupboard.—On the right, as you entered from\n",
      "the dining-room.—They were solid.—And old silver.—From the ladle one\n",
      "could get at least two hundred francs.—Double what he had earned in\n",
      "nineteen years.—It is true that he would have earned more if “the\n",
      "_administration_ had not _robbed him_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "His mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there was\n",
      "certainly mingled some struggle. Three o’clock struck. He opened his\n",
      "eyes again, drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture, stretched\n",
      "out his arm and felt of his knapsack, which he had thrown down on a\n",
      "corner of the alcove; then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed,\n",
      "and placed his feet on the floor, and thus found himself, almost\n",
      "without knowing it, seated on his bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude, which would have\n",
      "been suggestive of something sinister for any one who had seen him thus\n",
      "in the dark, the only person awake in that house where all were\n",
      "sleeping. All of a sudden he stooped down, removed his shoes and placed\n",
      "them softly on the mat beside the bed; then he resumed his thoughtful\n",
      "attitude, and became motionless once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout this hideous meditation, the thoughts which we have above\n",
      "indicated moved incessantly through his brain; entered, withdrew,\n",
      "re-entered, and in a manner oppressed him; and then he thought, also,\n",
      "without knowing why, and with the mechanical persistence of reverie, of\n",
      "a convict named Brevet, whom he had known in the galleys, and whose\n",
      "trousers had been upheld by a single suspender of knitted cotton. The\n",
      "checkered pattern of that suspender recurred incessantly to his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He remained in this situation, and would have so remained indefinitely,\n",
      "even until daybreak, had not the clock struck one—the half or quarter\n",
      "hour. It seemed to him that that stroke said to him, “Come on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He rose to his feet, hesitated still another moment, and listened; all\n",
      "was quiet in the house; then he walked straight ahead, with short\n",
      "steps, to the window, of which he caught a glimpse. The night was not\n",
      "very dark; there was a full moon, across which coursed large clouds\n",
      "driven by the wind. This created, outdoors, alternate shadow and gleams\n",
      "of light, eclipses, then bright openings of the clouds; and indoors a\n",
      "sort of twilight. This twilight, sufficient to enable a person to see\n",
      "his way, intermittent on account of the clouds, resembled the sort of\n",
      "livid light which falls through an air-hole in a cellar, before which\n",
      "the passers-by come and go. On arriving at the window, Jean Valjean\n",
      "examined it. It had no grating; it opened in the garden and was\n",
      "fastened, according to the fashion of the country, only by a small pin.\n",
      "He opened it; but as a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the\n",
      "room abruptly, he closed it again immediately. He scrutinized the\n",
      "garden with that attentive gaze which studies rather than looks. The\n",
      "garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall, easy to climb. Far\n",
      "away, at the extremity, he perceived tops of trees, spaced at regular\n",
      "intervals, which indicated that the wall separated the garden from an\n",
      "avenue or lane planted with trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having taken this survey, he executed a movement like that of a man who\n",
      "has made up his mind, strode to his alcove, grasped his knapsack,\n",
      "opened it, fumbled in it, pulled out of it something which he placed on\n",
      "the bed, put his shoes into one of his pockets, shut the whole thing up\n",
      "again, threw the knapsack on his shoulders, put on his cap, drew the\n",
      "visor down over his eyes, felt for his cudgel, went and placed it in\n",
      "the angle of the window; then returned to the bed, and resolutely\n",
      "seized the object which he had deposited there. It resembled a short\n",
      "bar of iron, pointed like a pike at one end. It would have been\n",
      "difficult to distinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit\n",
      "of iron could have been designed. Perhaps it was a lever; possibly it\n",
      "was a club.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing\n",
      "more than a miner’s candlestick. Convicts were, at that period,\n",
      "sometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which\n",
      "environ Toulon, and it was not rare for them to have miners’ tools at\n",
      "their command. These miners’ candlesticks are of massive iron,\n",
      "terminated at the lower extremity by a point, by means of which they\n",
      "are stuck into the rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the candlestick in his right hand; holding his breath and\n",
      "trying to deaden the sound of his tread, he directed his steps to the\n",
      "door of the adjoining room, occupied by the Bishop, as we already know.\n",

      "The door yielded to this pressure, and made an imperceptible and silent\n",

      "He waited a moment; then gave the door a second and a bolder push.\n",
      "\n",
      "It continued to yield in silence. The opening was now large enough to\n",

      "something of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the Day\n",
      "of Judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined\n",

      "terrible life, and that it was barking like a dog to arouse every one,\n",
      "and warn and to wake those who were asleep. He halted, shuddering,\n",
      "bewildered, and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels. He\n",
      "heard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers, and\n",
      "it seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar\n",
      "of the wind issuing from a cavern. It seemed impossible to him that the\n",
      "horrible clamor of that irritated hinge should not have disturbed the\n",
      "entire household, like the shock of an earthquake; the door, pushed by\n",
      "him, had taken the alarm, and had shouted; the old man would rise at\n",
      "once; the two old women would shriek out; people would come to their\n",
      "assistance; in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an\n",

      "He remained where he was, petrified like the statue of salt, not daring\n",
      "to make a movement. Several minutes elapsed. The door had fallen wide\n",

      "there. He lent an ear. Nothing was moving in the house. The noise made\n",
      "by the rusty hinge had not awakened any one.\n",
      "\n",
      "This first danger was past; but there still reigned a frightful tumult\n",
      "within him. Nevertheless, he did not retreat. Even when he had thought\n",
      "himself lost, he had not drawn back. His only thought now was to finish\n",
      "as soon as possible. He took a step and entered the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "This room was in a state of perfect calm. Here and there vague and\n",
      "confused forms were distinguishable, which in the daylight were papers\n",
      "scattered on a table, open folios, volumes piled upon a stool, an\n",
      "armchair heaped with clothing, a prie-Dieu, and which at that hour were\n",
      "only shadowy corners and whitish spots. Jean Valjean advanced with\n",
      "precaution, taking care not to knock against the furniture. He could\n",
      "hear, at the extremity of the room, the even and tranquil breathing of\n",
      "the sleeping Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "He suddenly came to a halt. He was near the bed. He had arrived there\n",
      "sooner than he had thought for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nature sometimes mingles her effects and her spectacles with our\n",
      "actions with sombre and intelligent appropriateness, as though she\n",
      "desired to make us reflect. For the last half-hour a large cloud had\n",
      "covered the heavens. At the moment when Jean Valjean paused in front of\n",
      "the bed, this cloud parted, as though on purpose, and a ray of light,\n",
      "traversing the long window, suddenly illuminated the Bishop’s pale\n",
      "face. He was sleeping peacefully. He lay in his bed almost completely\n",
      "dressed, on account of the cold of the Basses-Alps, in a garment of\n",
      "brown wool, which covered his arms to the wrists. His head was thrown\n",
      "back on the pillow, in the careless attitude of repose; his hand,\n",
      "adorned with the pastoral ring, and whence had fallen so many good\n",
      "deeds and so many holy actions, was hanging over the edge of the bed.\n",
      "His whole face was illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction,\n",
      "of hope, and of felicity. It was more than a smile, and almost a\n",
      "radiance. He bore upon his brow the indescribable reflection of a light\n",
      "which was invisible. The soul of the just contemplates in sleep a\n",
      "mysterious heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "A reflection of that heaven rested on the Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, at the same time, a luminous transparency, for that heaven was\n",
      "within him. That heaven was his conscience.\n",

      "\n",
      "At the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself, so to speak,\n",
      "upon that inward radiance, the sleeping Bishop seemed as in a glory. It\n",
      "remained, however, gentle and veiled in an ineffable half-light. That\n",
      "moon in the sky, that slumbering nature, that garden without a quiver,\n",
      "that house which was so calm, the hour, the moment, the silence, added\n",
      "some solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this\n",
      "man, and enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that white\n",
      "hair, those closed eyes, that face in which all was hope and all was\n",
      "confidence, that head of an old man, and that slumber of an infant.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something almost divine in this man, who was thus august,\n",
      "without being himself aware of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean was in the shadow, and stood motionless, with his iron\n",
      "candlestick in his hand, frightened by this luminous old man. Never had\n",
      "he beheld anything like this. This confidence terrified him. The moral\n",
      "world has no grander spectacle than this: a troubled and uneasy\n",
      "conscience, which has arrived on the brink of an evil action,\n",
      "contemplating the slumber of the just.\n",

      "That slumber in that isolation, and with a neighbor like himself, had\n",

      "\n",
      "No one could have told what was passing within him, not even himself.\n",
      "In order to attempt to form an idea of it, it is necessary to think of\n",
      "the most violent of things in the presence of the most gentle. Even on\n",
      "his visage it would have been impossible to distinguish anything with\n",
      "certainty. It was a sort of haggard astonishment. He gazed at it, and\n",
      "that was all. But what was his thought? It would have been impossible\n",
      "to divine it. What was evident was, that he was touched and astounded.\n",
      "But what was the nature of this emotion?\n",
      "\n",
      "His eye never quitted the old man. The only thing which was clearly to\n",
      "be inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange\n",
      "indecision. One would have said that he was hesitating between the two\n",
      "abysses,—the one in which one loses one’s self and that in which one\n",
      "saves one’s self. He seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss\n",
      "that hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards his\n",
      "brow, and he took off his cap; then his arm fell back with the same\n",

      "\n",
      "“Monseigneur, Monseigneur!” she exclaimed, “does your Grace know where\n",

      "\n",
      "“Great, good God! It is stolen! That man who was here last night has\n",

      "\n",
      "In a twinkling, with all the vivacity of an alert old woman, Madame\n",
      "Magloire had rushed to the oratory, entered the alcove, and returned to\n",
      "the Bishop. The Bishop had just bent down, and was sighing as he\n",
      "examined a plant of cochlearia des Guillons, which the basket had\n",
      "broken as it fell across the bed. He rose up at Madame Magloire’s cry.\n",

      "“Monseigneur, the man is gone! The silver has been stolen!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As she uttered this exclamation, her eyes fell upon a corner of the\n",

      "coping of the wall had been torn away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stay! yonder is the way he went. He jumped over into Cochefilet Lane.\n",
      "Ah, the abomination! He has stolen our silver!”\n",

      "\n",
      "The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he raised his grave eyes,\n",

      "\n",
      "“And, in the first place, was that silver ours?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Magloire was speechless. Another silence ensued; then the Bishop\n",
      "went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Madame Magloire, I have for a long time detained that silver\n",
      "wrongfully. It belonged to the poor. Who was that man? A poor man,\n",
      "evidently.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas! Jesus!” returned Madame Magloire. “It is not for my sake, nor\n",
      "for Mademoiselle’s. It makes no difference to us. But it is for the\n",
      "sake of Monseigneur. What is Monseigneur to eat with now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "A few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at which Jean\n",
      "Valjean had sat on the previous evening. As he ate his breakfast,\n",
      "Monseigneur Welcome remarked gayly to his sister, who said nothing, and\n",
      "to Madame Magloire, who was grumbling under her breath, that one really\n",
      "does not need either fork or spoon, even of wood, in order to dip a bit\n",
      "of bread in a cup of milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A pretty idea, truly,” said Madame Magloire to herself, as she went\n",

      "“Come in,” said the Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door opened. A singular and violent group made its appearance on\n",
      "the threshold. Three men were holding a fourth man by the collar. The\n",
      "three men were gendarmes; the other was Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "A brigadier of gendarmes, who seemed to be in command of the group, was\n",
      "standing near the door. He entered and advanced to the Bishop, making a\n",
      "military salute.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monseigneur—” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this word, Jean Valjean, who was dejected and seemed overwhelmed,\n",

      "\n",
      "“Silence!” said the gendarme. “He is Monseigneur the Bishop.”\n",
      "\n",

      "In the meantime, Monseigneur Bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his\n",
      "great age permitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! here you are!” he exclaimed, looking at Jean Valjean. “I am glad\n",
      "to see you. Well, but how is this? I gave you the candlesticks too,\n",
      "which are of silver like the rest, and for which you can certainly get\n",
      "two hundred francs. Why did you not carry them away with your forks and\n",
      "spoons?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean opened his eyes wide, and stared at the venerable Bishop\n",
      "with an expression which no human tongue can render any account of.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monseigneur,” said the brigadier of gendarmes, “so what this man said\n",
      "is true, then? We came across him. He was walking like a man who is\n",
      "running away. We stopped him to look into the matter. He had this\n",
      "silver—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And he told you,” interposed the Bishop with a smile, “that it had\n",
      "been given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had\n",

      "back here? It is a mistake.”\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Is it true that I am to be released?” he said, in an almost\n",
      "inarticulate voice, and as though he were talking in his sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, thou art released; dost thou not understand?” said one of the\n",
      "gendarmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My friend,” resumed the Bishop, “before you go, here are your\n",
      "candlesticks. Take them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He stepped to the chimney-piece, took the two silver candlesticks, and\n",
      "brought them to Jean Valjean. The two women looked on without uttering\n",
      "a word, without a gesture, without a look which could disconcert the\n",
      "Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean was trembling in every limb. He took the two candlesticks\n",
      "mechanically, and with a bewildered air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said the Bishop, “go in peace. By the way, when you return, my\n",
      "friend, it is not necessary to pass through the garden. You can always\n",
      "enter and depart through the street door. It is never fastened with\n",
      "anything but a latch, either by day or by night.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean was like a man on the point of fainting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bishop drew near to him, and said in a low voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do not forget, never forget, that you have promised to use this money\n",
      "in becoming an honest man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean, who had no recollection of ever having promised anything,\n",
      "remained speechless. The Bishop had emphasized the words when he\n",
      "uttered them. He resumed with solemnity:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good.\n",
      "It is your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black thoughts\n",
      "and the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it. He set\n",
      "out at a very hasty pace through the fields, taking whatever roads and\n",
      "paths presented themselves to him, without perceiving that he was\n",
      "incessantly retracing his steps. He wandered thus the whole morning,\n",
      "without having eaten anything and without feeling hungry. He was the\n",
      "prey of a throng of novel sensations. He was conscious of a sort of\n",
      "rage; he did not know against whom it was directed. He could not have\n",
      "told whether he was touched or humiliated. There came over him at\n",
      "moments a strange emotion which he resisted and to which he opposed the\n",
      "hardness acquired during the last twenty years of his life. This state\n",
      "of mind fatigued him. He perceived with dismay that the sort of\n",
      "frightful calm which the injustice of his misfortune had conferred upon\n",
      "him was giving way within him. He asked himself what would replace\n",
      "this. At times he would have actually preferred to be in prison with\n",
      "the gendarmes, and that things should not have happened in this way; it\n",
      "would have agitated him less. Although the season was tolerably far\n",
      "advanced, there were still a few late flowers in the hedge-rows here\n",
      "and there, whose odor as he passed through them in his march recalled\n",
      "to him memories of his childhood. These memories were almost\n",
      "intolerable to him, it was so long since they had recurred to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the sun declined to its setting, casting long shadows athwart the\n",
      "soil from every pebble, Jean Valjean sat down behind a bush upon a\n",
      "large ruddy plain, which was absolutely deserted. There was nothing on\n",
      "the horizon except the Alps. Not even the spire of a distant village.\n",
      "Jean Valjean might have been three leagues distant from D—— A path\n",
      "which intersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle of this meditation, which would have contributed not a\n",
      "little to render his rags terrifying to any one who might have\n",
      "encountered him, a joyous sound became audible.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned his head and saw a little Savoyard, about ten years of age,\n",
      "coming up the path and singing, his hurdy-gurdy on his hip, and his\n",
      "marmot-box on his back.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of those gay and gentle children, who go from land to land\n",

      "\n",
      "Without stopping his song, the lad halted in his march from time to\n",
      "time, and played at knuckle-bones with some coins which he had in his\n",
      "hand—his whole fortune, probably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among this money there was one forty-sou piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "The child halted beside the bush, without perceiving Jean Valjean, and\n",
      "tossed up his handful of sous, which, up to that time, he had caught\n",
      "with a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time the forty-sou piece escaped him, and went rolling towards the\n",
      "brushwood until it reached Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean set his foot upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, the child had looked after his coin and had caught\n",
      "sight of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He showed no astonishment, but walked straight up to the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spot was absolutely solitary. As far as the eye could see there was\n",
      "not a person on the plain or on the path. The only sound was the tiny,\n",
      "feeble cries of a flock of birds of passage, which was traversing the\n",
      "heavens at an immense height. The child was standing with his back to\n",
      "the sun, which cast threads of gold in his hair and empurpled with its\n",
      "blood-red gleam the savage face of Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir,” said the little Savoyard, with that childish confidence which is\n",

      "\n",
      "It seemed as though Jean Valjean did not hear him. The child grasped\n",
      "him by the collar of his blouse and shook him. At the same time he made\n",
      "an effort to displace the big iron-shod shoe which rested on his\n",
      "treasure.\n",

      "His eyes were troubled. He gazed at the child, in a sort of amazement,\n",
      "then he stretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in a\n",
      "terrible voice, “Who’s there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I, sir,” replied the child. “Little Gervais! I! Give me back my forty\n",
      "sous, if you please! Take your foot away, sir, if you please!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then irritated, though he was so small, and becoming almost menacing:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come now, will you take your foot away? Take your foot away, or we’ll\n",
      "see!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! It’s still you!” said Jean Valjean, and rising abruptly to his\n",
      "feet, his foot still resting on the silver piece, he added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you take yourself off!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The frightened child looked at him, then began to tremble from head to\n",
      "foot, and after a few moments of stupor he set out, running at the top\n",
      "of his speed, without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain\n",
      "distance, and Jean Valjean heard him sobbing, in the midst of his own\n",
      "reverie.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of a few moments the child had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun had set.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shadows were descending around Jean Valjean. He had eaten nothing\n",
      "all day; it is probable that he was feverish.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after the\n",
      "child’s flight. The breath heaved his chest at long and irregular\n",
      "intervals. His gaze, fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him, seemed\n",
      "to be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient\n",
      "fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass. All at once\n",
      "he shivered; he had just begun to feel the chill of evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "He settled his cap more firmly on his brow, sought mechanically to\n",
      "cross and button his blouse, advanced a step and stopped to pick up his\n",
      "cudgel.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment he caught sight of the forty-sou piece, which his foot\n",
      "had half ground into the earth, and which was shining among the\n",
      "pebbles. It was as though he had received a galvanic shock. “What is\n",
      "this?” he muttered between his teeth. He recoiled three paces, then\n",
      "halted, without being able to detach his gaze from the spot which his\n",
      "foot had trodden but an instant before, as though the thing which lay\n",
      "glittering there in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the\n",
      "silver coin, seized it, and straightened himself up again and began to\n",
      "gaze afar off over the plain, at the same time casting his eyes towards\n",
      "all points of the horizon, as he stood there erect and shivering, like\n",
      "a terrified wild animal which is seeking refuge.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw nothing. Night was falling, the plain was cold and vague, great\n",
      "banks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, “Ah!” and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child\n",
      "had disappeared. After about thirty paces he paused, looked about him\n",
      "and saw nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he shouted with all his might:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Little Gervais! Little Gervais!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused and waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "The landscape was gloomy and deserted. He was encompassed by space.\n",
      "There was nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was\n",
      "lost, and a silence which engulfed his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "An icy north wind was blowing, and imparted to things around him a sort\n",
      "of lugubrious life. The bushes shook their thin little arms with\n",
      "incredible fury. One would have said that they were threatening and\n",
      "pursuing some one.\n",
      "\n",
      "He set out on his march again, then he began to run; and from time to\n",
      "time he halted and shouted into that solitude, with a voice which was\n",
      "the most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to\n",
      "hear, “Little Gervais! Little Gervais!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuredly, if the child had heard him, he would have been alarmed and\n",
      "would have taken good care not to show himself. But the child was no\n",
      "doubt already far away.\n",
      "\n",
      "He encountered a priest on horseback. He stepped up to him and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur le Curé, have you seen a child pass?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the priest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One named Little Gervais?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have seen no one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew two five-franc pieces from his money-bag and handed them to the\n",
      "priest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur le Curé, this is for your poor people. Monsieur le Curé, he\n",
      "was a little lad, about ten years old, with a marmot, I think, and a\n",
      "hurdy-gurdy. One of those Savoyards, you know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not seen him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Little Gervais? There are no villages here? Can you tell me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he is like what you say, my friend, he is a little stranger. Such\n",
      "persons pass through these parts. We know nothing of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence,\n",
      "and gave them to the priest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For your poor,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he added, wildly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur l’Abbé, have me arrested. I am a thief.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste, much alarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean set out on a run, in the direction which he had first\n",
      "taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this way he traversed a tolerably long distance, gazing, calling,\n",
      "shouting, but he met no one. Two or three times he ran across the plain\n",
      "towards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being\n",
      "reclining or crouching down; it turned out to be nothing but brushwood\n",
      "or rocks nearly on a level with the earth. At length, at a spot where\n",
      "three paths intersected each other, he stopped. The moon had risen. He\n",
      "sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time, “Little\n",
      "Gervais! Little Gervais! Little Gervais!” His shout died away in the\n",
      "mist, without even awakening an echo. He murmured yet once more,\n",
      "“Little Gervais!” but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice. It was\n",
      "his last effort; his legs gave way abruptly under him, as though an\n",
      "invisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his\n",
      "evil conscience; he fell exhausted, on a large stone, his fists\n",
      "clenched in his hair and his face on his knees, and he cried, “I am a\n",
      "wretch!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then his heart burst, and he began to cry. It was the first time that\n",
      "he had wept in nineteen years.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Jean Valjean left the Bishop’s house, he was, as we have seen,\n",
      "quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto. He\n",
      "could not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him. He\n",
      "hardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the\n",
      "old man. “You have promised me to become an honest man. I buy your\n",
      "soul. I take it away from the spirit of perversity; I give it to the\n",
      "good God.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This recurred to his mind unceasingly. To this celestial kindness he\n",
      "opposed pride, which is the fortress of evil within us. He was\n",
      "indistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest\n",
      "assault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet; that\n",
      "his obduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency; that if\n",
      "he yielded, he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the\n",
      "actions of other men had filled his soul through so many years, and\n",
      "which pleased him; that this time it was necessary to conquer or to be\n",
      "conquered; and that a struggle, a colossal and final struggle, had been\n",
      "begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the presence of these lights, he proceeded like a man who is\n",
      "intoxicated. As he walked thus with haggard eyes, did he have a\n",
      "distinct perception of what might result to him from his adventure at\n",
      "D——? Did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or\n",
      "importune the spirit at certain moments of life? Did a voice whisper in\n",
      "his ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny; that\n",
      "there no longer remained a middle course for him; that if he were not\n",
      "henceforth the best of men, he would be the worst; that it behooved him\n",
      "now, so to speak, to mount higher than the Bishop, or fall lower than\n",
      "the convict; that if he wished to become good he must become an angel;\n",
      "that if he wished to remain evil, he must become a monster?\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, again, some questions must be put, which we have already put to\n",
      "ourselves elsewhere: did he catch some shadow of all this in his\n",
      "thought, in a confused way? Misfortune certainly, as we have said, does\n",
      "form the education of the intelligence; nevertheless, it is doubtful\n",
      "whether Jean Valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have\n",
      "here indicated. If these ideas occurred to him, he but caught glimpses\n",
      "of, rather than saw them, and they only succeeded in throwing him into\n",
      "an unutterable and almost painful state of emotion. On emerging from\n",
      "that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys, the Bishop\n",
      "had hurt his soul, as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on\n",
      "emerging from the dark. The future life, the possible life which\n",
      "offered itself to him henceforth, all pure and radiant, filled him with\n",
      "tremors and anxiety. He no longer knew where he really was. Like an\n",
      "owl, who should suddenly see the sun rise, the convict had been dazzled\n",
      "and blinded, as it were, by virtue.\n",
      "\n",
      "That which was certain, that which he did not doubt, was that he was no\n",
      "longer the same man, that everything about him was changed, that it was\n",
      "no longer in his power to make it as though the Bishop had not spoken\n",
      "to him and had not touched him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this state of mind he had encountered little Gervais, and had robbed\n",
      "him of his forty sous. Why? He certainly could not have explained it;\n",
      "was this the last effect and the supreme effort, as it were, of the\n",
      "evil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys,—a remnant of\n",
      "impulse, a result of what is called in statics, _acquired force?_ It\n",
      "was that, and it was also, perhaps, even less than that. Let us say it\n",
      "simply, it was not he who stole; it was not the man; it was the beast,\n",
      "who, by habit and instinct, had simply placed his foot upon that money,\n",
      "while the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hitherto\n",
      "unheard-of thoughts besetting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When intelligence reawakened and beheld that action of the brute, Jean\n",
      "Valjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: Awakened]\n",
      "\n",
      "It was because,—strange phenomenon, and one which was possible only in\n",
      "the situation in which he found himself,—in stealing the money from\n",
      "that child, he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable.\n",
      "\n",
      "However that may be, this last evil action had a decisive effect on\n",
      "him; it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind, and\n",
      "dispersed it, placed on one side the thick obscurity, and on the other\n",
      "the light, and acted on his soul, in the state in which it then was, as\n",
      "certain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitating\n",
      "one element and clarifying the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, even before examining himself and reflecting, all\n",
      "bewildered, like one who seeks to save himself, he tried to find the\n",
      "child in order to return his money to him; then, when he recognized the\n",
      "fact that this was impossible, he halted in despair. At the moment when\n",
      "he exclaimed “I am a wretch!” he had just perceived what he was, and he\n",
      "was already separated from himself to such a degree, that he seemed to\n",
      "himself to be no longer anything more than a phantom, and as if he had,\n",
      "there before him, in flesh and blood, the hideous galley-convict, Jean\n",
      "Valjean, cudgel in hand, his blouse on his hips, his knapsack filled\n",
      "with stolen objects on his back, with his resolute and gloomy visage,\n",
      "with his thoughts filled with abominable projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excess of unhappiness had, as we have remarked, made him in some sort a\n",
      "visionary. This, then, was in the nature of a vision. He actually saw\n",
      "that Jean Valjean, that sinister face, before him. He had almost\n",
      "reached the point of asking himself who that man was, and he was\n",
      "horrified by him.\n",
      "\n",
      "His brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm\n",
      "moments in which reverie is so profound that it absorbs reality. One no\n",
      "longer beholds the object which one has before one, and one sees, as\n",
      "though apart from one’s self, the figures which one has in one’s own\n",
      "mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus he contemplated himself, so to speak, face to face, and at the\n",
      "same time, athwart this hallucination, he perceived in a mysterious\n",
      "depth a sort of light which he at first took for a torch. On\n",
      "scrutinizing this light which appeared to his conscience with more\n",
      "attention, he recognized the fact that it possessed a human form and\n",
      "that this torch was the Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "His conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it,—the\n",
      "Bishop and Jean Valjean. Nothing less than the first was required to\n",
      "soften the second. By one of those singular effects, which are peculiar\n",
      "to this sort of ecstasies, in proportion as his reverie continued, as\n",
      "the Bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes, so did Jean Valjean\n",
      "grow less and vanish. After a certain time he was no longer anything\n",
      "more than a shade. All at once he disappeared. The Bishop alone\n",
      "remained; he filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a\n",
      "magnificent radiance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean wept for a long time. He wept burning tears, he sobbed\n",
      "with more weakness than a woman, with more fright than a child.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he wept, daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul; an\n",
      "extraordinary light; a light at once ravishing and terrible. His past\n",
      "life, his first fault, his long expiation, his external brutishness,\n",
      "his internal hardness, his dismissal to liberty, rejoicing in manifold\n",
      "plans of vengeance, what had happened to him at the Bishop’s, the last\n",
      "thing that he had done, that theft of forty sous from a child, a crime\n",
      "all the more cowardly, and all the more monstrous since it had come\n",
      "after the Bishop’s pardon,—all this recurred to his mind and appeared\n",
      "clearly to him, but with a clearness which he had never hitherto\n",
      "witnessed. He examined his life, and it seemed horrible to him; his\n",
      "soul, and it seemed frightful to him. In the meantime a gentle light\n",
      "rested over this life and this soul. It seemed to him that he beheld\n",
      "Satan by the light of Paradise.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many hours did he weep thus? What did he do after he had wept?\n",
      "Whither did he go! No one ever knew. The only thing which seems to be\n",
      "authenticated is that that same night the carrier who served Grenoble\n",
      "at that epoch, and who arrived at D—— about three o’clock in the\n",
      "morning, saw, as he traversed the street in which the Bishop’s\n",

      "CHAPTER I—THE YEAR 1817\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1817 is the year which Louis XVIII., with a certain royal assurance\n",
      "which was not wanting in pride, entitled the twenty-second of his\n",
      "reign. It is the year in which M. Bruguière de Sorsum was celebrated.\n",
      "All the hairdressers’ shops, hoping for powder and the return of the\n",
      "royal bird, were besmeared with azure and decked with fleurs-de-lys. It\n",
      "was the candid time at which Count Lynch sat every Sunday as\n",
      "church-warden in the church-warden’s pew of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, in\n",
      "his costume of a peer of France, with his red ribbon and his long nose\n",
      "and the majesty of profile peculiar to a man who has performed a\n",
      "brilliant action. The brilliant action performed by M. Lynch was this:\n",
      "being mayor of Bordeaux, on the 12th of March, 1814, he had surrendered\n",
      "the city a little too promptly to M. the Duke d’Angoulême. Hence his\n",
      "peerage. In 1817 fashion swallowed up little boys of from four to six\n",
      "years of age in vast caps of morocco leather with ear-tabs resembling\n",
      "Esquimaux mitres. The French army was dressed in white, after the mode\n",
      "of the Austrian; the regiments were called legions; instead of numbers\n",
      "they bore the names of departments; Napoleon was at St. Helena; and\n",
      "since England refused him green cloth, he was having his old coats\n",
      "turned. In 1817 Pelligrini sang; Mademoiselle Bigottini danced; Potier\n",
      "reigned; Odry did not yet exist. Madame Saqui had succeeded to Forioso.\n",
      "There were still Prussians in France. M. Delalot was a personage.\n",
      "Legitimacy had just asserted itself by cutting off the hand, then the\n",
      "head, of Pleignier, of Carbonneau, and of Tolleron. The Prince de\n",
      "Talleyrand, grand chamberlain, and the Abbé Louis, appointed minister\n",
      "of finance, laughed as they looked at each other, with the laugh of the\n",
      "two augurs; both of them had celebrated, on the 14th of July, 1790, the\n",
      "mass of federation in the Champ de Mars; Talleyrand had said it as\n",
      "bishop, Louis had served it in the capacity of deacon. In 1817, in the\n",
      "side-alleys of this same Champ de Mars, two great cylinders of wood\n",
      "might have been seen lying in the rain, rotting amid the grass, painted\n",
      "blue, with traces of eagles and bees, from which the gilding was\n",
      "falling. These were the columns which two years before had upheld the\n",
      "Emperor’s platform in the Champ de Mai. They were blackened here and\n",
      "there with the scorches of the bivouac of Austrians encamped near\n",
      "Gros-Caillou. Two or three of these columns had disappeared in these\n",
      "bivouac fires, and had warmed the large hands of the Imperial troops.\n",
      "The Field of May had this remarkable point: that it had been held in\n",
      "the month of June and in the Field of March (Mars). In this year, 1817,\n",
      "two things were popular: the Voltaire-Touquet and the snuff-box _à la\n",
      "Charter_. The most recent Parisian sensation was the crime of Dautun,\n",
      "who had thrown his brother’s head into the fountain of the\n",
      "Flower-Market.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had begun to feel anxious at the Naval Department, on account of\n",
      "the lack of news from that fatal frigate, _The Medusa_, which was\n",
      "destined to cover Chaumareix with infamy and Géricault with glory.\n",
      "Colonel Selves was going to Egypt to become Soliman-Pasha. The palace\n",
      "of Thermes, in the Rue de La Harpe, served as a shop for a cooper. On\n",
      "the platform of the octagonal tower of the Hotel de Cluny, the little\n",
      "shed of boards, which had served as an observatory to Messier, the\n",
      "naval astronomer under Louis XVI., was still to be seen. The Duchesse\n",
      "de Duras read to three or four friends her unpublished _Ourika_, in her\n",
      "boudoir furnished by X. in sky-blue satin. The N’s were scratched off\n",
      "the Louvre. The bridge of Austerlitz had abdicated, and was entitled\n",
      "the bridge of the King’s Garden [du Jardin du Roi], a double enigma,\n",
      "which disguised the bridge of Austerlitz and the Jardin des Plantes at\n",
      "one stroke. Louis XVIII., much preoccupied while annotating Horace with\n",

      "Blachevelle, of Montauban. Naturally, each of them had his mistress.\n",
      "Blachevelle loved Favourite, so named because she had been in England;\n",
      "Listolier adored Dahlia, who had taken for her nickname the name of a\n",

      "Favourite, Dahlia, Zéphine, and Fantine were four ravishing young\n",

      "yet entirely divorced from their needles; somewhat disturbed by\n",
      "intrigues, but still retaining on their faces something of the serenity\n",
      "of toil, and in their souls that flower of honesty which survives the\n",
      "first fall in woman. One of the four was called the young, because she\n",
      "was the youngest of them, and one was called the old; the old one was\n",
      "twenty-three. Not to conceal anything, the three first were more\n",
      "experienced, more heedless, and more emancipated into the tumult of\n",

      "\n",
      "Dahlia, Zéphine, and especially Favourite, could not have said as much.\n",
      "There had already been more than one episode in their romance, though\n",
      "hardly begun; and the lover who had borne the name of Adolph in the\n",

      "\n",
      "Favourite having been in England, was admired by Dahlia and Zéphine.\n",
      "She had had an establishment of her own very early in life. Her father\n",
      "was an old unmarried professor of mathematics, a brutal man and a\n",
      "braggart, who went out to give lessons in spite of his age. This\n",
      "professor, when he was a young man, had one day seen a chambermaid’s\n",
      "gown catch on a fender; he had fallen in love in consequence of this\n",
      "accident. The result had been Favourite. She met her father from time\n",
      "to time, and he bowed to her. One morning an old woman with the air of\n",
      "a devotee, had entered her apartments, and had said to her, “You do not\n",
      "know me, Mamemoiselle?” “No.” “I am your mother.” Then the old woman\n",
      "opened the sideboard, and ate and drank, had a mattress which she owned\n",
      "brought in, and installed herself. This cross and pious old mother\n",
      "never spoke to Favourite, remained hours without uttering a word,\n",
      "breakfasted, dined, and supped for four, and went down to the porter’s\n",
      "quarters for company, where she spoke ill of her daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was having rosy nails that were too pretty which had drawn Dahlia to\n",
      "Listolier, to others perhaps, to idleness. How could she make such\n",
      "nails work? She who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her\n",
      "hands. As for Zéphine, she had conquered Fameuil by her roguish and\n",

      "women, while Fantine was a good girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good! some one will exclaim; and Tholomyès? Solomon would reply that\n",

      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fantine was one of those beings who blossom, so to speak, from the\n",
      "dregs of the people. Though she had emerged from the most unfathomable\n",
      "depths of social shadow, she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous\n",
      "and the unknown. She was born at M. sur M. Of what parents? Who can\n",
      "say? She had never known father or mother. She was called Fantine. Why\n",
      "Fantine? She had never borne any other name. At the epoch of her birth\n",
      "the Directory still existed. She had no family name; she had no family;\n",
      "no baptismal name; the Church no longer existed. She bore the name\n",
      "which pleased the first random passer-by, who had encountered her, when\n",
      "a very small child, running bare-legged in the street. She received the\n",
      "name as she received the water from the clouds upon her brow when it\n",
      "rained. She was called little Fantine. No one knew more than that. This\n",
      "human creature had entered life in just this way. At the age of ten,\n",
      "Fantine quitted the town and went to service with some farmers in the\n",
      "neighborhood. At fifteen she came to Paris “to seek her fortune.”\n",
      "Fantine was beautiful, and remained pure as long as she could. She was\n",
      "a lovely blonde, with fine teeth. She had gold and pearls for her\n",
      "dowry; but her gold was on her head, and her pearls were in her mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "She worked for her living; then, still for the sake of her living,—for\n",
      "the heart, also, has its hunger,—she loved.\n",
      "\n",
      "She loved Tholomyès.\n",
      "\n",
      "An amour for him; passion for her. The streets of the Latin quarter,\n",
      "filled with throngs of students and grisettes, saw the beginning of\n",
      "their dream. Fantine had long evaded Tholomyès in the mazes of the hill\n",
      "of the Pantheon, where so many adventurers twine and untwine, but in\n",
      "such a way as constantly to encounter him again. There is a way of\n",
      "avoiding which resembles seeking. In short, the eclogue took place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blachevelle, Listolier, and Fameuil formed a sort of group of which\n",
      "Tholomyès was the head. It was he who possessed the wit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tholomyès was the antique old student; he was rich; he had an income of\n",
      "four thousand francs; four thousand francs! a splendid scandal on Mount\n",
      "Sainte-Geneviève. Tholomyès was a fast man of thirty, and badly\n",
      "preserved. He was wrinkled and toothless, and he had the beginning of a\n",
      "bald spot, of which he himself said with sadness, _the skull at thirty,\n",
      "the knee at forty_. His digestion was mediocre, and he had been\n",
      "attacked by a watering in one eye. But in proportion as his youth\n",
      "disappeared, gayety was kindled; he replaced his teeth with\n",
      "buffooneries, his hair with mirth, his health with irony, his weeping\n",
      "eye laughed incessantly. He was dilapidated but still in flower. His\n",
      "youth, which was packing up for departure long before its time, beat a\n",
      "retreat in good order, bursting with laughter, and no one saw anything\n",
      "but fire. He had had a piece rejected at the Vaudeville. He made a few\n",
      "verses now and then. In addition to this he doubted everything to the\n",
      "last degree, which is a vast force in the eyes of the weak. Being thus\n",
      "ironical and bald, he was the leader. _Iron_ is an English word. Is it\n",
      "possible that irony is derived from it?\n",
      "\n",
      "One day Tholomyès took the three others aside, with the gesture of an\n",
      "oracle, and said to them:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fantine, Dahlia, Zéphine, and Favourite have been teasing us for\n",
      "nearly a year to give them a surprise. We have promised them solemnly\n",
      "that we would. They are forever talking about it to us, to me in\n",
      "particular, just as the old women in Naples cry to Saint Januarius,\n",
      "‘_Faccia gialluta, fa o miracolo_, Yellow face, perform thy miracle,’\n",
      "so our beauties say to me incessantly, ‘Tholomyès, when will you bring\n",
      "forth your surprise?’ At the same time our parents keep writing to us.\n",
      "Pressure on both sides. The moment has arrived, it seems to me; let us\n",
      "discuss the question.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon, Tholomyès lowered his voice and articulated something so\n",
      "mirthful, that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon the four\n",
      "mouths simultaneously, and Blachevelle exclaimed, “That is an idea.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I? I detest him,” replied Favourite in the same tone, seizing her fork\n",
      "again. “He is avaricious. I love the little fellow opposite me in my\n",

      "that he is an actor by profession. I love actors. As soon as he comes\n",

      "There he goes with his shouting. But, my dear, you are splitting my\n",
      "head!’ So he goes up to rat-ridden garrets, to black holes, as high as\n",
      "he can mount, and there he sets to singing, declaiming, how do I know\n",
      "what? so that he can be heard downstairs! He earns twenty sous a day at\n",
      "an attorney’s by penning quibbles. He is the son of a former precentor\n",
      "of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas. Ah! he is very nice. He idolizes me so,\n",
      "that one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes, he said to\n",
      "me: _‘Mamselle, make your gloves into fritters, and I will eat them.’_\n",
      "It is only artists who can say such things as that. Ah! he is very\n",
      "nice. I am in a fair way to go out of my head over that little fellow.\n",

      "the wind irritates me; the wind does not abate. Blachevelle is very\n",
      "stingy; there are hardly any green peas in the market; one does not\n",
      "know what to eat. I have the spleen, as the English say, butter is so\n",

      "“Let us not talk at random nor too fast,” he exclaimed. “Let us\n",

      "gentlemen. Let us mingle majesty with the feast. Let us eat with\n",

      "his empire, “Come to yourselves. This pun which has fallen from the\n",
      "skies must not be received with too much stupor. Everything which falls\n",
      "in that way is not necessarily worthy of enthusiasm and respect. The\n",
      "pun is the dung of the mind which soars. The jest falls, no matter\n",
      "where; and the mind after producing a piece of stupidity plunges into\n",
      "the azure depths. A whitish speck flattened against the rock does not\n",
      "prevent the condor from soaring aloft. Far be it from me to insult the\n",
      "pun! I honor it in proportion to its merits; nothing more. All the most\n",
      "august, the most sublime, the most charming of humanity, and perhaps\n",
      "outside of humanity, have made puns. Jesus Christ made a pun on St.\n",
      "Peter, Moses on Isaac, Æschylus on Polynices, Cleopatra on Octavius.\n",
      "And observe that Cleopatra’s pun preceded the battle of Actium, and\n",
      "that had it not been for it, no one would have remembered the city of\n",
      "Toryne, a Greek name which signifies a ladle. That once conceded, I\n",
      "return to my exhortation. I repeat, brothers, I repeat, no zeal, no\n",
      "hubbub, no excess; even in witticisms, gayety, jollities, or plays on\n",
      "words. Listen to me. I have the prudence of Amphiaraüs and the baldness\n",

      "of turnovers, good sense and art are requisite. Gluttony chastises the\n",
      "glutton, _Gula punit Gulax_. Indigestion is charged by the good God\n",

      "In all things the word _finis_ must be written in good season;\n",

      "a thesis in Latin upon the manner in which torture was administered at\n",
      "Rome at the epoch when Munatius Demens was quæstor of the Parricide;\n",
      "because I am going to be a doctor, apparently it does not follow that\n",

      "the prick, to do without the nuptial bed, and to brave love? Nothing\n",
      "more simple. Here is the receipt: lemonade, excessive exercise, hard\n",
      "labor; work yourself to death, drag blocks, sleep not, hold vigil,\n",
      "gorge yourself with nitrous beverages, and potions of nymphæas; drink\n",
      "emulsions of poppies and agnus castus; season this with a strict diet,\n",
      "starve yourself, and add thereto cold baths, girdles of herbs, the\n",

      "espied a beautiful girl with white stockings well drawn up, which\n",
      "displayed her legs. This prologue pleased him, and Blachevelle fell in\n",
      "love. The one he loved was Favourite. O Favourite, thou hast Ionian\n",
      "lips. There was a Greek painter named Euphorion, who was surnamed the\n",
      "painter of the lips. That Greek alone would have been worthy to paint\n",
      "thy mouth. Listen! before thee, there was never a creature worthy of\n",
      "the name. Thou wert made to receive the apple like Venus, or to eat it\n",
      "like Eve; beauty begins with thee. I have just referred to Eve; it is\n",
      "thou who hast created her. Thou deservest the letters-patent of the\n",
      "beautiful woman. O Favourite, I cease to address you as ‘thou,’ because\n",
      "I pass from poetry to prose. You were speaking of my name a little\n",
      "while ago. That touched me; but let us, whoever we may be, distrust\n",
      "names. They may delude us. I am called Félix, and I am not happy. Words\n",
      "are liars. Let us not blindly accept the indications which they afford\n",
      "us. It would be a mistake to write to Liège 2 for corks, and to Pau for\n",
      "gloves. Miss Dahlia, were I in your place, I would call myself Rosa. A\n",
      "flower should smell sweet, and woman should have wit. I say nothing of\n",
      "Fantine; she is a dreamer, a musing, thoughtful, pensive person; she is\n",
      "a phantom possessed of the form of a nymph and the modesty of a nun,\n",
      "who has strayed into the life of a grisette, but who takes refuge in\n",
      "illusions, and who sings and prays and gazes into the azure without\n",
      "very well knowing what she sees or what she is doing, and who, with her\n",
      "eyes fixed on heaven, wanders in a garden where there are more birds\n",
      "than are in existence. O Fantine, know this: I, Tholomyès, I am an\n",
      "illusion; but she does not even hear me, that blond maid of Chimeras!\n",
      "as for the rest, everything about her is freshness, suavity, youth,\n",
      "sweet morning light. O Fantine, maid worthy of being called Marguerite\n",
      "or Pearl, you are a woman from the beauteous Orient. Ladies, a second\n",
      "piece of advice: do not marry; marriage is a graft; it takes well or\n",
      "ill; avoid that risk. But bah! what am I saying? I am wasting my words.\n",
      "Girls are incurable on the subject of marriage, and all that we wise\n",
      "men can say will not prevent the waistcoat-makers and the\n",
      "shoe-stitchers from dreaming of husbands studded with diamonds. Well,\n",
      "so be it; but, my beauties, remember this, you eat too much sugar. You\n",
      "have but one fault, O woman, and that is nibbling sugar. O nibbling\n",
      "sex, your pretty little white teeth adore sugar. Now, heed me well,\n",
      "sugar is a salt. All salts are withering. Sugar is the most desiccating\n",
      "of all salts; it sucks the liquids of the blood through the veins;\n",
      "hence the coagulation, and then the solidification of the blood; hence\n",
      "tubercles in the lungs, hence death. That is why diabetes borders on\n",
      "consumption. Then, do not crunch sugar, and you will live. I turn to\n",
      "the men: gentlemen, make conquest, rob each other of your well-beloved\n",
      "without remorse. Chassez across. In love there are no friends.\n",
      "Everywhere where there is a pretty woman hostility is open. No quarter,\n",
      "war to the death! a pretty woman is a _casus belli_; a pretty woman is\n",
      "flagrant misdemeanor. All the invasions of history have been determined\n",
      "by petticoats. Woman is man’s right. Romulus carried off the Sabines;\n",
      "William carried off the Saxon women; Cæsar carried off the Roman women.\n",

      "\n",
      "At the same moment Blachevelle, supported by Listolier and Fameuil,\n",
      "struck up to a plaintive air, one of those studio songs composed of the\n",
      "first words which come to hand, rhymed richly and not at all, as\n",
      "destitute of sense as the gesture of the tree and the sound of the\n",
      "wind, which have their birth in the vapor of pipes, and are dissipated\n",
      "and take their flight with them. This is the couplet by which the group\n",
      "replied to Tholomyès’ harangue:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The father turkey-cocks so grave\n",
      "Some money to an agent gave,\n",
      "That master good Clermont-Tonnerre\n",

      "But this good Clermont could not be\n",
      "Made pope, because no priest was he;\n",
      "And then their agent, whose wrath burned,\n",
      "With all their money back returned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not calculated to calm Tholomyès’ improvisation; he emptied\n",
      "his glass, filled, refilled it, and began again:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Down with wisdom! Forget all that I have said. Let us be neither\n",
      "prudes nor prudent men nor prudhommes. I propose a toast to mirth; be\n",

      "Indigestion and the digest. Let Justinian be the male, and Feasting,\n",
      "the female! Joy in the depths! Live, O creation! The world is a great\n",

      "kept by some people named Thénardier, husband and wife. It was situated\n",
      "in Boulanger Lane. Over the door there was a board nailed flat against\n",

      "epaulettes of a general, with large silver stars; red spots represented\n",
      "blood; the rest of the picture consisted of smoke, and probably\n",
      "represented a battle. Below ran this inscription: AT THE SIGN OF\n",
      "SERGEANT OF WATERLOO (_Au Sargent de Waterloo_).\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a\n",
      "hostelry. Nevertheless, the vehicle, or, to speak more accurately, the\n",
      "fragment of a vehicle, which encumbered the street in front of the\n",
      "cook-shop of the _Sergeant of Waterloo_, one evening in the spring of\n",
      "1818, would certainly have attracted, by its mass, the attention of any\n",
      "painter who had passed that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the fore-carriage of one of those trucks which are used in\n",
      "wooded tracts of country, and which serve to transport thick planks and\n",
      "the trunks of trees. This fore-carriage was composed of a massive iron\n",
      "axle-tree with a pivot, into which was fitted a heavy shaft, and which\n",
      "was supported by two huge wheels. The whole thing was compact,\n",
      "overwhelming, and misshapen. It seemed like the gun-carriage of an\n",
      "enormous cannon. The ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels, the\n",
      "fellies, the hub, the axle, and the shaft, a layer of mud, a hideous\n",
      "yellowish daubing hue, tolerably like that with which people are fond\n",
      "of ornamenting cathedrals. The wood was disappearing under mud, and the\n",
      "iron beneath rust. Under the axle-tree hung, like drapery, a huge\n",
      "chain, worthy of some Goliath of a convict. This chain suggested, not\n",
      "the beams, which it was its office to transport, but the mastodons and\n",
      "mammoths which it might have served to harness; it had the air of the\n",
      "galleys, but of cyclopean and superhuman galleys, and it seemed to have\n",
      "been detached from some monster. Homer would have bound Polyphemus with\n",
      "it, and Shakespeare, Caliban.\n",

      "Why was that fore-carriage of a truck in that place in the street? In\n",
      "the first place, to encumber the street; next, in order that it might\n",
      "finish the process of rusting. There is a throng of institutions in the\n",
      "old social order, which one comes across in this fashion as one walks\n",
      "about outdoors, and which have no other reasons for existence than the\n",
      "above.\n",
      "\n",
      "The centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle, and\n",
      "in the loop, as in the rope of a swing, there were seated and grouped,\n",
      "on that particular evening, in exquisite interlacement, two little\n",
      "girls; one about two years and a half old, the other, eighteen months;\n",
      "the younger in the arms of the other. A handkerchief, cleverly knotted\n",
      "about them, prevented their falling out. A mother had caught sight of\n",

      "The two children, who were dressed prettily and with some elegance,\n",

      "full of laughter. One had chestnut hair; the other, brown. Their\n",
      "innocent faces were two delighted surprises; a blossoming shrub which\n",
      "grew near wafted to the passers-by perfumes which seemed to emanate\n",
      "from them; the child of eighteen months displayed her pretty little\n",
      "bare stomach with the chaste indecency of childhood. Above and around\n",
      "these two delicate heads, all made of happiness and steeped in light,\n",
      "the gigantic fore-carriage, black with rust, almost terrible, all\n",
      "entangled in curves and wild angles, rose in a vault, like the entrance\n",
      "of a cavern. A few paces apart, crouching down upon the threshold of\n",
      "the hostelry, the mother, not a very prepossessing woman, by the way,\n",
      "though touching at that moment, was swinging the two children by means\n",
      "of a long cord, watching them carefully, for fear of accidents, with\n",
      "that animal and celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity. At\n",
      "every backward and forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident\n",
      "sound, which resembled a cry of rage; the little girls were in\n",
      "ecstasies; the setting sun mingled in this joy, and nothing could be\n",
      "more charming than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain of\n",
      "Titans the swing of cherubim.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the meantime, some one had approached her, as she was beginning the\n",
      "first couplet of the romance, and suddenly she heard a voice saying\n",
      "very near her ear:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have two beautiful children there, Madame.”\n",

      "A woman stood before her, a few paces distant. This woman also had a\n",
      "child, which she carried in her arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was carrying, in addition, a large carpet-bag, which seemed very\n",
      "heavy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This woman’s child was one of the most divine creatures that it is\n",
      "possible to behold. It was a girl, two or three years of age. She could\n",
      "have entered into competition with the two other little ones, so far as\n",
      "the coquetry of her dress was concerned; she wore a cap of fine linen,\n",
      "ribbons on her bodice, and Valenciennes lace on her cap. The folds of\n",
      "her skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white, firm, and\n",
      "dimpled leg. She was admirably rosy and healthy. The little beauty\n",
      "inspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks. Of her\n",
      "eyes nothing could be known, except that they must be very large, and\n",
      "that they had magnificent lashes. She was asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "She slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her age.\n",
      "The arms of mothers are made of tenderness; in them children sleep\n",
      "profoundly.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the mother, her appearance was sad and poverty-stricken. She was\n",
      "dressed like a working-woman who is inclined to turn into a peasant\n",
      "again. She was young. Was she handsome? Perhaps; but in that attire it\n",
      "was not apparent. Her hair, a golden lock of which had escaped, seemed\n",
      "very thick, but was severely concealed beneath an ugly, tight, close,\n",
      "nun-like cap, tied under the chin. A smile displays beautiful teeth\n",
      "when one has them; but she did not smile. Her eyes did not seem to have\n",
      "been dry for a very long time. She was pale; she had a very weary and\n",
      "rather sickly appearance. She gazed upon her daughter asleep in her\n",
      "arms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child. A\n",
      "large blue handkerchief, such as the Invalides use, was folded into a\n",
      "fichu, and concealed her figure clumsily. Her hands were sunburnt and\n",
      "all dotted with freckles, her forefinger was hardened and lacerated\n",
      "with the needle; she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff, a\n",
      "linen gown, and coarse shoes. It was Fantine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Fantine, but difficult to recognize. Nevertheless, on\n",
      "scrutinizing her attentively, it was evident that she still retained\n",
      "her beauty. A melancholy fold, which resembled the beginning of irony,\n",
      "wrinkled her right cheek. As for her toilette, that aerial toilette of\n",
      "muslin and ribbons, which seemed made of mirth, of folly, and of music,\n",
      "full of bells, and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that\n",
      "beautiful and dazzling hoar-frost which is mistaken for diamonds in the\n",
      "sunlight; it melts and leaves the branch quite black.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten months had elapsed since the “pretty farce.”\n",
      "\n",

      "After abandonment, straightened circumstances. Fantine had immediately\n",
      "lost sight of Favourite, Zéphine and Dahlia; the bond once broken on\n",
      "the side of the men, it was loosed between the women; they would have\n",
      "been greatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later, that\n",
      "they had been friends; there no longer existed any reason for such a\n",
      "thing. Fantine had remained alone. The father of her child gone,—alas!\n",
      "such ruptures are irrevocable,—she found herself absolutely isolated,\n",
      "minus the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure. Drawn away by\n",
      "her _liaison_ with Tholomyès to disdain the pretty trade which she\n",
      "knew, she had neglected to keep her market open; it was now closed to\n",
      "her. She had no resource. Fantine barely knew how to read, and did not\n",
      "know how to write; in her childhood she had only been taught to sign\n",
      "her name; she had a public letter-writer indite an epistle to\n",
      "Tholomyès, then a second, then a third. Tholomyès replied to none of\n",
      "them. Fantine heard the gossips say, as they looked at her child: “Who\n",
      "takes those children seriously! One only shrugs one’s shoulders over\n",
      "such children!” Then she thought of Tholomyès, who had shrugged his\n",
      "shoulders over his child, and who did not take that innocent being\n",
      "seriously; and her heart grew gloomy toward that man. But what was she\n",
      "to do? She no longer knew to whom to apply. She had committed a fault,\n",
      "but the foundation of her nature, as will be remembered, was modesty\n",
      "and virtue. She was vaguely conscious that she was on the verge of\n",
      "falling into distress, and of gliding into a worse state. Courage was\n",
      "necessary; she possessed it, and held herself firm. The idea of\n",
      "returning to her native town of M. sur M. occurred to her. There, some\n",
      "one might possibly know her and give her work; yes, but it would be\n",
      "necessary to conceal her fault. In a confused way she perceived the\n",
      "necessity of a separation which would be more painful than the first\n",
      "one. Her heart contracted, but she took her resolution. Fantine, as we\n",
      "shall see, had the fierce bravery of life. She had already valiantly\n",
      "renounced finery, had dressed herself in linen, and had put all her\n",
      "silks, all her ornaments, all her ribbons, and all her laces on her\n",
      "daughter, the only vanity which was left to her, and a holy one it was.\n",
      "She sold all that she had, which produced for her two hundred francs;\n",
      "her little debts paid, she had only about eighty francs left. At the\n",
      "age of twenty-two, on a beautiful spring morning, she quitted Paris,\n",
      "bearing her child on her back. Any one who had seen these two pass\n",
      "would have had pity on them. This woman had, in all the world, nothing\n",
      "but her child, and the child had, in all the world, no one but this\n",

      "what was odd, with a languishing air, which she owed to her perusal of\n",
      "romances. She was a simpering, but masculine creature. Old romances\n",
      "produce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of cook-shop\n",
      "woman. She was still young; she was barely thirty. If this crouching\n",
      "woman had stood upright, her lofty stature and her frame of a\n",

      "morning on foot; that, as she was carrying her child, and felt\n",
      "fatigued, she had got into the Villemomble coach when she met it; that\n",
      "from Villemomble she had come to Montfermeil on foot; that the little\n",

      "presence of our twilight of virtue. One would say that they feel\n",
      "themselves to be angels, and that they know us to be men. Then the\n",
      "child began to laugh; and although the mother held fast to her, she\n",
      "slipped to the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being\n",
      "which wished to run. All at once she caught sight of the two others in\n",

      "\n",
      "“You see, I cannot take my daughter to the country. My work will not\n",
      "permit it. With a child one can find no situation. People are\n",
      "ridiculous in the country. It was the good God who caused me to pass\n",
      "your inn. When I caught sight of your little ones, so pretty, so clean,\n",
      "and so happy, it overwhelmed me. I said: ‘Here is a good mother. That\n",

      "\n",
      "Here a man’s voice called from the depths of the cook-shop:—\n",

      "“It must be, said a warrior.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Let us say a word or two of them now. We will complete the sketch later\n",
      "on.\n",
      "\n",
      "These beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse people\n",
      "who have been successful, and of intelligent people who have descended\n",
      "in the scale, which is between the class called “middle” and the class\n",
      "denominated as “inferior,” and which combines some of the defects of\n",
      "the second with nearly all the vices of the first, without possessing\n",
      "the generous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of the\n",
      "bourgeois.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were of those dwarfed natures which, if a dull fire chances to\n",
      "warm them up, easily become monstrous. There was in the woman a\n",
      "substratum of the brute, and in the man the material for a blackguard.\n",
      "Both were susceptible, in the highest degree, of the sort of hideous\n",
      "progress which is accomplished in the direction of evil. There exist\n",
      "crab-like souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness,\n",
      "retrograding in life rather than advancing, employing experience to\n",
      "augment their deformity, growing incessantly worse, and becoming more\n",
      "and more impregnated with an ever-augmenting blackness. This man and\n",
      "woman possessed such souls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier, in particular, was troublesome for a physiognomist. One can\n",
      "only look at some men to distrust them; for one feels that they are\n",
      "dark in both directions. They are uneasy in the rear and threatening in\n",
      "front. There is something of the unknown about them. One can no more\n",
      "answer for what they have done than for what they will do. The shadow\n",
      "which they bear in their glance denounces them. From merely hearing\n",
      "them utter a word or seeing them make a gesture, one obtains a glimpse\n",
      "of sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their\n",
      "future.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Thénardier, if he himself was to be believed, had been a soldier—a\n",
      "sergeant, he said. He had probably been through the campaign of 1815,\n",
      "and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor, it would seem. We\n",
      "shall see later on how much truth there was in this. The sign of his\n",
      "hostelry was in allusion to one of his feats of arms. He had painted it\n",
      "himself; for he knew how to do a little of everything, and badly.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which, after\n",
      "having been _Clélie_, was no longer anything but _Lodoïska_, still\n",
      "noble, but ever more and more vulgar, having fallen from Mademoiselle\n",
      "de Scudéri to Madame Bournon-Malarme, and from Madame de Lafayette to\n",
      "Madame Barthélemy-Hadot, was setting the loving hearts of the\n",
      "portresses of Paris aflame, and even ravaging the suburbs to some\n",
      "extent. Madame Thénardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort\n",
      "of books. She lived on them. In them she drowned what brains she\n",
      "possessed. This had given her, when very young, and even a little\n",
      "later, a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband, a scamp of a\n",
      "certain depth, a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar, coarse\n",
      "and fine at one and the same time, but, so far as sentimentalism was\n",
      "concerned, given to the perusal of Pigault-Lebrun, and “in what\n",
      "concerns the sex,” as he said in his jargon—a downright, unmitigated\n",
      "lout. His wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was. Later\n",
      "on, when her hair, arranged in a romantically drooping fashion, began\n",
      "to grow gray, when the Megæra began to be developed from the Pamela,\n",
      "the female Thénardier was nothing but a coarse, vicious woman, who had\n",
      "dabbled in stupid romances. Now, one cannot read nonsense with\n",
      "impunity. The result was that her eldest daughter was named Éponine; as\n",
      "for the younger, the poor little thing came near being called Gulnare;\n",
      "I know not to what diversion, effected by a romance of Ducray-Dumenil,\n",
      "she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of Azelma.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, we will remark by the way, everything was not ridiculous and\n",
      "superficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding, and which\n",
      "may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names. By the side of\n",
      "this romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social\n",
      "symptom. It is not rare for the neatherd’s boy nowadays to bear the\n",
      "name of Arthur, Alfred, or Alphonse, and for the vicomte—if there are\n",
      "still any vicomtes—to be called Thomas, Pierre, or Jacques. This\n",
      "displacement, which places the “elegant” name on the plebeian and the\n",
      "rustic name on the aristocrat, is nothing else than an eddy of\n",
      "equality. The irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there\n",
      "as everywhere else. Beneath this apparent discord there is a great and\n",

      "\n",
      "Thanks to the traveller’s fifty-seven francs, Thénardier had been able\n",
      "to avoid a protest and to honor his signature. On the following month\n",
      "they were again in need of money. The woman took Cosette’s outfit to\n",
      "Paris, and pawned it at the pawnbroker’s for sixty francs. As soon as\n",
      "that sum was spent, the Thénardiers grew accustomed to look on the\n",
      "little girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity;\n",
      "and they treated her accordingly. As she had no longer any clothes,\n",
      "they dressed her in the cast-off petticoats and chemises of the\n",
      "Thénardier brats; that is to say, in rags. They fed her on what all the\n",
      "rest had left—a little better than the dog, a little worse than the\n",
      "cat. Moreover, the cat and the dog were her habitual table-companions;\n",
      "Cosette ate with them under the table, from a wooden bowl similar to\n",
      "theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mother, who had established herself, as we shall see later on, at\n",
      "M. sur M., wrote, or, more correctly, caused to be written, a letter\n",
      "every month, that she might have news of her child. The Thénardiers\n",
      "replied invariably, “Cosette is doing wonderfully well.”\n",
      "\n",

      "At the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs\n",
      "for the seventh month, and continued her remittances with tolerable\n",
      "regularity from month to month. The year was not completed when\n",
      "Thénardier said: “A fine favor she is doing us, in sooth! What does she\n",

      "francs. The mother, whom they had persuaded into the belief that her\n",
      "child was happy, “and was coming on well,” submitted, and forwarded the\n",
      "twelve francs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on the\n",
      "other. Mother Thénardier loved her two daughters passionately, which\n",
      "caused her to hate the stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous\n",
      "aspects. Little as was the space occupied by Cosette, it seemed to her\n",
      "as though it were taken from her own, and that that little child\n",
      "diminished the air which her daughters breathed. This woman, like many\n",
      "women of her sort, had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and\n",
      "injuries to dispense each day. If she had not had Cosette, it is\n",
      "certain that her daughters, idolized as they were, would have received\n",
      "the whole of it; but the stranger did them the service to divert the\n",
      "blows to herself. Her daughters received nothing but caresses. Cosette\n",
      "could not make a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy\n",
      "shower of violent blows and unmerited chastisement. The sweet, feeble\n",

      "The mother paid the fifteen francs.\n",
      "\n",
      "From year to year the child grew, and so did her wretchedness.\n",

      "\n",
      "If this mother had returned to Montfermeil at the end of these three\n",

      "Injustice had made her peevish, and misery had made her ugly. Nothing\n",

      "\n",
      "After leaving her little Cosette with the Thénardiers, she had\n",
      "continued her journey, and had reached M. sur M.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, it will be remembered, was in 1818.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fantine had quitted her province ten years before. M. sur M. had\n",
      "changed its aspect. While Fantine had been slowly descending from\n",
      "wretchedness to wretchedness, her native town had prospered.\n",
      "\n",
      "About two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the\n",
      "grand events of small districts had taken place.\n",
      "\n",
      "This detail is important, and we regard it as useful to develop it at\n",
      "length; we should almost say, to underline it.\n",
      "\n",
      "From time immemorial, M. sur M. had had for its special industry the\n",
      "imitation of English jet and the black glass trinkets of Germany. This\n",
      "industry had always vegetated, on account of the high price of the raw\n",
      "material, which reacted on the manufacture. At the moment when Fantine\n",
      "returned to M. sur M., an unheard-of transformation had taken place in\n",
      "the production of “black goods.” Towards the close of 1815 a man, a\n",
      "stranger, had established himself in the town, and had been inspired\n",
      "with the idea of substituting, in this manufacture, gum-lac for resin,\n",
      "and, for bracelets in particular, slides of sheet-iron simply laid\n",
      "together, for slides of soldered sheet-iron.\n",
      "\n",
      "This very small change had effected a revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "This very small change had, in fact, prodigiously reduced the cost of\n",
      "the raw material, which had rendered it possible in the first place, to\n",
      "raise the price of manufacture, a benefit to the country; in the second\n",
      "place, to improve the workmanship, an advantage to the consumer; in the\n",
      "third place, to sell at a lower price, while trebling the profit, which\n",
      "was a benefit to the manufacturer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus three results ensued from one idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "In less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich,\n",
      "which is good, and had made every one about him rich, which is better.\n",
      "He was a stranger in the Department. Of his origin, nothing was known;\n",
      "of the beginning of his career, very little. It was rumored that he had\n",
      "come to town with very little money, a few hundred francs at the most.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was from this slender capital, enlisted in the service of an\n",
      "ingenious idea, developed by method and thought, that he had drawn his\n",
      "own fortune, and the fortune of the whole countryside.\n",
      "\n",
      "On his arrival at M. sur M. he had only the garments, the appearance,\n",
      "and the language of a workingman.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into the\n",
      "little town of M. sur M., just at nightfall, on a December evening,\n",
      "knapsack on back and thorn club in hand, a large fire had broken out in\n",
      "the town-hall. This man had rushed into the flames and saved, at the\n",
      "risk of his own life, two children who belonged to the captain of the\n",
      "gendarmerie; this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his\n",

      "He was a man about fifty years of age, who had a preoccupied air, and\n",
      "who was good. That was all that could be said about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirably\n",
      "reconstructed, M. sur M. had become a rather important centre of trade.\n",
      "Spain, which consumes a good deal of black jet, made enormous purchases\n",
      "there each year. M. sur M. almost rivalled London and Berlin in this\n",
      "branch of commerce. Father Madeleine’s profits were such, that at the\n",
      "end of the second year he was able to erect a large factory, in which\n",
      "there were two vast workrooms, one for the men, and the other for\n",
      "women. Any one who was hungry could present himself there, and was sure\n",
      "of finding employment and bread. Father Madeleine required of the men\n",
      "good will, of the women pure morals, and of all, probity. He had\n",
      "separated the work-rooms in order to separate the sexes, and so that\n",
      "the women and girls might remain discreet. On this point he was\n",
      "inflexible. It was the only thing in which he was in a manner\n",
      "intolerant. He was all the more firmly set on this severity, since M.\n",
      "sur M., being a garrison town, opportunities for corruption abounded.\n",
      "However, his coming had been a boon, and his presence was a godsend.\n",
      "Before Father Madeleine’s arrival, everything had languished in the\n",
      "country; now everything lived with a healthy life of toil. A strong\n",
      "circulation warmed everything and penetrated everywhere. Slack seasons\n",
      "and wretchedness were unknown. There was no pocket so obscure that it\n",
      "had not a little money in it; no dwelling so lowly that there was not\n",
      "some little joy within it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Father Madeleine gave employment to every one. He exacted but one\n",
      "thing: Be an honest man. Be an honest woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we have said, in the midst of this activity of which he was the\n",
      "cause and the pivot, Father Madeleine made his fortune; but a singular\n",
      "thing in a simple man of business, it did not seem as though that were\n",
      "his chief care. He appeared to be thinking much of others, and little\n",
      "of himself. In 1820 he was known to have a sum of six hundred and\n",
      "thirty thousand francs lodged in his name with Laffitte; but before\n",
      "reserving these six hundred and thirty thousand francs, he had spent\n",
      "more than a million for the town and its poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hospital was badly endowed; he founded six beds there. M. sur M. is\n",
      "divided into the upper and the lower town. The lower town, in which he\n",
      "lived, had but one school, a miserable hovel, which was falling to\n",
      "ruin: he constructed two, one for girls, the other for boys. He\n",
      "allotted a salary from his own funds to the two instructors, a salary\n",
      "twice as large as their meagre official salary, and one day he said to\n",
      "some one who expressed surprise, “The two prime functionaries of the\n",
      "state are the nurse and the schoolmaster.” He created at his own\n",
      "expense an infant school, a thing then almost unknown in France, and a\n",
      "fund for aiding old and infirm workmen. As his factory was a centre, a\n",
      "new quarter, in which there were a good many indigent families, rose\n",
      "rapidly around him; he established there a free dispensary.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, when they watched his beginnings, the good souls said, “He’s\n",
      "a jolly fellow who means to get rich.” When they saw him enriching the\n",
      "country before he enriched himself, the good souls said, “He is an\n",
      "ambitious man.” This seemed all the more probable since the man was\n",
      "religious, and even practised his religion to a certain degree, a thing\n",
      "which was very favorably viewed at that epoch. He went regularly to low\n",
      "mass every Sunday. The local deputy, who nosed out all rivalry\n",
      "everywhere, soon began to grow uneasy over this religion. This deputy\n",
      "had been a member of the legislative body of the Empire, and shared the\n",
      "religious ideas of a father of the Oratoire, known under the name of\n",
      "Fouché, Duc d’Otrante, whose creature and friend he had been. He\n",
      "indulged in gentle raillery at God with closed doors. But when he\n",
      "beheld the wealthy manufacturer Madeleine going to low mass at seven\n",
      "o’clock, he perceived in him a possible candidate, and resolved to\n",
      "outdo him; he took a Jesuit confessor, and went to high mass and to\n",
      "vespers. Ambition was at that time, in the direct acceptation of the\n",
      "word, a race to the steeple. The poor profited by this terror as well\n",
      "as the good God, for the honorable deputy also founded two beds in the\n",
      "hospital, which made twelve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, in 1819 a rumor one morning circulated through the town\n",
      "to the effect that, on the representations of the prefect and in\n",
      "consideration of the services rendered by him to the country, Father\n",
      "Madeleine was to be appointed by the King, mayor of M. sur M. Those who\n",
      "had pronounced this newcomer to be “an ambitious fellow,” seized with\n",
      "delight on this opportunity which all men desire, to exclaim, “There!\n",
      "what did we say!” All M. sur M. was in an uproar. The rumor was well\n",
      "founded. Several days later the appointment appeared in the _Moniteur_.\n",
      "On the following day Father Madeleine refused.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this same year of 1819 the products of the new process invented by\n",
      "Madeleine figured in the industrial exhibition; when the jury made\n",
      "their report, the King appointed the inventor a chevalier of the Legion\n",
      "of Honor. A fresh excitement in the little town. Well, so it was the\n",
      "cross that he wanted! Father Madeleine refused the cross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decidedly this man was an enigma. The good souls got out of their\n",
      "predicament by saying, “After all, he is some sort of an adventurer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have seen that the country owed much to him; the poor owed him\n",
      "everything; he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had been\n",
      "obliged to honor and respect him. His workmen, in particular, adored\n",
      "him, and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity.\n",
      "When he was known to be rich, “people in society” bowed to him, and he\n",
      "received invitations in the town; he was called, in town, Monsieur\n",
      "Madeleine; his workmen and the children continued to call him Father\n",
      "Madeleine, and that was what was most adapted to make him smile. In\n",
      "proportion as he mounted, throve, invitations rained down upon him.\n",
      "“Society” claimed him for its own. The prim little drawing-rooms on M.\n",
      "sur M., which, of course, had at first been closed to the artisan,\n",
      "opened both leaves of their folding-doors to the millionnaire. They\n",
      "made a thousand advances to him. He refused.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time the good gossips had no trouble. “He is an ignorant man, of\n",
      "no education. No one knows where he came from. He would not know how to\n",
      "behave in society. It has not been absolutely proved that he knows how\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When they saw him making money, they said, “He is a man of business.”\n",
      "When they saw him scattering his money about, they said, “He is an\n",
      "ambitious man.” When he was seen to decline honors, they said, “He is\n",
      "an adventurer.” When they saw him repulse society, they said, “He is a\n",
      "brute.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1820, five years after his arrival in M. sur M., the services which\n",
      "he had rendered to the district were so dazzling, the opinion of the\n",
      "whole country round about was so unanimous, that the King again\n",
      "appointed him mayor of the town. He again declined; but the prefect\n",
      "resisted his refusal, all the notabilities of the place came to implore\n",
      "him, the people in the street besought him; the urging was so vigorous\n",
      "that he ended by accepting. It was noticed that the thing which seemed\n",
      "chiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe\n",
      "addressed to him by an old woman of the people, who called to him from\n",

      "On the other hand, he remained as simple as on the first day. He had\n",
      "gray hair, a serious eye, the sunburned complexion of a laborer, the\n",
      "thoughtful visage of a philosopher. He habitually wore a hat with a\n",
      "wide brim, and a long coat of coarse cloth, buttoned to the chin. He\n",
      "fulfilled his duties as mayor; but, with that exception, he lived in\n",
      "solitude. He spoke to but few people. He avoided polite attentions; he\n",
      "escaped quickly; he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity of\n",
      "talking; he gave, in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling. The\n",
      "women said of him, “What a good-natured bear!” His pleasure consisted\n",
      "in strolling in the fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "He always took his meals alone, with an open book before him, which he\n",
      "read. He had a well-selected little library. He loved books; books are\n",
      "cold but safe friends. In proportion as leisure came to him with\n",
      "fortune, he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate his mind. It\n",
      "had been observed that, ever since his arrival at M. sur M., his\n",
      "language had grown more polished, more choice, and more gentle with\n",
      "every passing year. He liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls,\n",
      "but he rarely made use of it. When he did happen to do so, his shooting\n",
      "was something so infallible as to inspire terror. He never killed an\n",
      "inoffensive animal. He never shot at a little bird.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although he was no longer young, it was thought that he was still\n",
      "prodigiously strong. He offered his assistance to any one who was in\n",
      "need of it, lifted a horse, released a wheel clogged in the mud, or\n",
      "stopped a runaway bull by the horns. He always had his pockets full of\n",
      "money when he went out; but they were empty on his return. When he\n",
      "passed through a village, the ragged brats ran joyously after him, and\n",
      "surrounded him like a swarm of gnats.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was thought that he must, in the past, have lived a country life,\n",
      "since he knew all sorts of useful secrets, which he taught to the\n",
      "peasants. He taught them how to destroy scurf on wheat, by sprinkling\n",
      "it and the granary and inundating the cracks in the floor with a\n",
      "solution of common salt; and how to chase away weevils by hanging up\n",
      "orviot in bloom everywhere, on the walls and the ceilings, among the\n",
      "grass and in the houses.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had “recipes” for exterminating from a field, blight, tares,\n",
      "foxtail, and all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat. He defended\n",
      "a rabbit warren against rats, simply by the odor of a guinea-pig which\n",
      "he placed in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day he saw some country people busily engaged in pulling up\n",
      "nettles; he examined the plants, which were uprooted and already dried,\n",
      "and said: “They are dead. Nevertheless, it would be a good thing to\n",
      "know how to make use of them. When the nettle is young, the leaf makes\n",
      "an excellent vegetable; when it is older, it has filaments and fibres\n",
      "like hemp and flax. Nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth. Chopped up,\n",
      "nettles are good for poultry; pounded, they are good for horned cattle.\n",
      "The seed of the nettle, mixed with fodder, gives gloss to the hair of\n",
      "animals; the root, mixed with salt, produces a beautiful yellow\n",
      "coloring-matter. Moreover, it is an excellent hay, which can be cut\n",
      "twice. And what is required for the nettle? A little soil, no care, no\n",
      "culture. Only the seed falls as it is ripe, and it is difficult to\n",
      "collect it. That is all. With the exercise of a little care, the nettle\n",
      "could be made useful; it is neglected and it becomes hurtful. It is\n",
      "exterminated. How many men resemble the nettle!” He added, after a\n",
      "pause: “Remember this, my friends: there are no such things as bad\n",
      "plants or bad men. There are only bad cultivators.”\n",

      "When he saw the door of a church hung in black, he entered: he sought\n",
      "out funerals as other men seek christenings. Widowhood and the grief of\n",
      "others attracted him, because of his great gentleness; he mingled with\n",
      "the friends clad in mourning, with families dressed in black, with the\n",
      "priests groaning around a coffin. He seemed to like to give to his\n",
      "thoughts for text these funereal psalmodies filled with the vision of\n",
      "the other world. With his eyes fixed on heaven, he listened with a sort\n",
      "of aspiration towards all the mysteries of the infinite, those sad\n",
      "voices which sing on the verge of the obscure abyss of death.\n",
      "\n",
      "He performed a multitude of good actions, concealing his agency in them\n",
      "as a man conceals himself because of evil actions. He penetrated houses\n",
      "privately, at night; he ascended staircases furtively. A poor wretch on\n",
      "returning to his attic would find that his door had been opened,\n",
      "sometimes even forced, during his absence. The poor man made a clamor\n",
      "over it: some malefactor had been there! He entered, and the first\n",
      "thing he beheld was a piece of gold lying forgotten on some piece of\n",
      "furniture. The “malefactor” who had been there was Father Madeleine.\n",
      "\n",

      "earth, where nothing is complete. To have continually at one’s side a\n",
      "woman, a daughter, a sister, a charming being, who is there because you\n",

      "\n",
      "At M. sur M. he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of an\n",

      "them to us in order to induce us to reflect. Only since animals are\n",
      "mere shadows, God has not made them capable of education in the full\n",
      "sense of the word; what is the use? On the contrary, our souls being\n",
      "realities and having a goal which is appropriate to them, God has\n",
      "bestowed on them intelligence; that is to say, the possibility of\n",
      "education. Social education, when well done, can always draw from a\n",

      "This, be it said, is of course from the restricted point of view of the\n",

      "\n",
      "Give to this dog-son of a wolf a human face, and the result will be\n",
      "Javert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert had been born in prison, of a fortune-teller, whose husband was\n",
      "in the galleys. As he grew up, he thought that he was outside the pale\n",
      "of society, and he despaired of ever re-entering it. He observed that\n",
      "society unpardoningly excludes two classes of men,—those who attack it\n",
      "and those who guard it; he had no choice except between these two\n",
      "classes; at the same time, he was conscious of an indescribable\n",
      "foundation of rigidity, regularity, and probity, complicated with an\n",
      "inexpressible hatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung. He\n",
      "entered the police; he succeeded there. At forty years of age he was an\n",

      "Before proceeding further, let us come to an understanding as to the\n",
      "words, “human face,” which we have just applied to Javert.\n",
      "\n",
      "The human face of Javert consisted of a flat nose, with two deep\n",
      "nostrils, towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks. One\n",
      "felt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns\n",
      "for the first time. When Javert laughed,—and his laugh was rare and\n",
      "terrible,—his thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth,\n",
      "but his gums, and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage\n",
      "fold, as on the muzzle of a wild beast. Javert, serious, was a\n",
      "watchdog; when he laughed, he was a tiger. As for the rest, he had very\n",
      "little skull and a great deal of jaw; his hair concealed his forehead\n",
      "and fell over his eyebrows; between his eyes there was a permanent,\n",
      "central frown, like an imprint of wrath; his gaze was obscure; his\n",
      "mouth pursed up and terrible; his air that of ferocious command.\n",
      "\n",
      "This man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments,\n",
      "comparatively; but he rendered them almost bad, by dint of exaggerating\n",
      "them,—respect for authority, hatred of rebellion; and in his eyes,\n",
      "murder, robbery, all crimes, are only forms of rebellion. He enveloped\n",
      "in a blind and profound faith every one who had a function in the\n",
      "state, from the prime minister to the rural policeman. He covered with\n",
      "scorn, aversion, and disgust every one who had once crossed the legal\n",
      "threshold of evil. He was absolute, and admitted no exceptions. On the\n",
      "one hand, he said, “The functionary can make no mistake; the magistrate\n",
      "is never the wrong.” On the other hand, he said, “These men are\n",
      "irremediably lost. Nothing good can come from them.” He fully shared\n",
      "the opinion of those extreme minds which attribute to human law I know\n",
      "not what power of making, or, if the reader will have it so, of\n",
      "authenticating, demons, and who place a Styx at the base of society. He\n",
      "was stoical, serious, austere; a melancholy dreamer, humble and\n",
      "haughty, like fanatics. His glance was like a gimlet, cold and\n",
      "piercing. His whole life hung on these two words: watchfulness and\n",
      "supervision. He had introduced a straight line into what is the most\n",
      "crooked thing in the world; he possessed the conscience of his\n",
      "usefulness, the religion of his functions, and he was a spy as other\n",
      "men are priests. Woe to the man who fell into his hands! He would have\n",
      "arrested his own father, if the latter had escaped from the galleys,\n",
      "and would have denounced his mother, if she had broken her ban. And he\n",
      "would have done it with that sort of inward satisfaction which is\n",
      "conferred by virtue. And, withal, a life of privation, isolation,\n",
      "abnegation, chastity, with never a diversion. It was implacable duty;\n",
      "the police understood, as the Spartans understood Sparta, a pitiless\n",
      "lying in wait, a ferocious honesty, a marble informer, Brutus in\n",
      "Vidocq.\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert’s whole person was expressive of the man who spies and who\n",
      "withdraws himself from observation. The mystical school of Joseph de\n",
      "Maistre, which at that epoch seasoned with lofty cosmogony those things\n",
      "which were called the ultra newspapers, would not have failed to\n",
      "declare that Javert was a symbol. His brow was not visible; it\n",
      "disappeared beneath his hat: his eyes were not visible, since they were\n",
      "lost under his eyebrows: his chin was not visible, for it was plunged\n",
      "in his cravat: his hands were not visible; they were drawn up in his\n",
      "sleeves: and his cane was not visible; he carried it under his coat.\n",
      "But when the occasion presented itself, there was suddenly seen to\n",
      "emerge from all this shadow, as from an ambuscade, a narrow and angular\n",
      "forehead, a baleful glance, a threatening chin, enormous hands, and a\n",
      "monstrous cudgel.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his leisure moments, which were far from frequent, he read, although\n",
      "he hated books; this caused him to be not wholly illiterate. This could\n",
      "be recognized by some emphasis in his speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we have said, he had no vices. When he was pleased with himself, he\n",
      "permitted himself a pinch of snuff. Therein lay his connection with\n",
      "humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reader will have no difficulty in understanding that Javert was the\n",
      "terror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the Ministry\n",
      "of Justice designates under the rubric, Vagrants. The name of Javert\n",
      "routed them by its mere utterance; the face of Javert petrified them at\n",
      "sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was this formidable man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert was like an eye constantly fixed on M. Madeleine. An eye full of\n",
      "suspicion and conjecture. M. Madeleine had finally perceived the fact;\n",
      "but it seemed to be of no importance to him. He did not even put a\n",
      "question to Javert; he neither sought nor avoided him; he bore that\n",
      "embarrassing and almost oppressive gaze without appearing to notice it.\n",
      "He treated Javert with ease and courtesy, as he did all the rest of the\n",
      "world.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was divined, from some words which escaped Javert, that he had\n",
      "secretly investigated, with that curiosity which belongs to the race,\n",
      "and into which there enters as much instinct as will, all the anterior\n",
      "traces which Father Madeleine might have left elsewhere. He seemed to\n",
      "know, and he sometimes said in covert words, that some one had gleaned\n",
      "certain information in a certain district about a family which had\n",
      "disappeared. Once he chanced to say, as he was talking to himself, “I\n",
      "think I have him!” Then he remained pensive for three days, and uttered\n",
      "not a word. It seemed that the thread which he thought he held had\n",
      "broken.\n",

      "Moreover, and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the too\n",
      "absolute sense which certain words might present, there can be nothing\n",
      "really infallible in a human creature, and the peculiarity of instinct\n",
      "is that it can become confused, thrown off the track, and defeated.\n",

      "One morning M. Madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of M. sur\n",

      "approached. An old man named Father Fauchelevent had just fallen\n",

      "\n",
      "This Fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom M. Madeleine had at\n",
      "that time. When Madeleine arrived in the neighborhood, Fauchelevent, an\n",
      "ex-notary and a peasant who was almost educated, had a business which\n",
      "was beginning to be in a bad way. Fauchelevent had seen this simple\n",
      "workman grow rich, while he, a lawyer, was being ruined. This had\n",
      "filled him with jealousy, and he had done all he could, on every\n",
      "occasion, to injure Madeleine. Then bankruptcy had come; and as the old\n",
      "man had nothing left but a cart and a horse, and neither family nor\n",
      "children, he had turned carter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horse had two broken legs and could not rise. The old man was\n",

      "lamentable manner. They had tried, but in vain, to drag him out. An\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment, and crushing\n",

      "\n",
      "“Listen,” resumed Madeleine; “there is still room enough under the cart\n",
      "to allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back. Only\n",
      "half a minute, and the poor man can be taken out. Is there any one here\n",
      "who has stout loins and heart? There are five louis d’or to be earned!”\n",

      "Javert went on:—\n",

      "\n",
      "“He was a convict.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! It is crushing me!” cried the old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madeleine raised his head, met Javert’s falcon eye still fixed upon\n",
      "him, looked at the motionless peasants, and smiled sadly. Then, without\n",
      "saying a word, he fell on his knees, and before the crowd had even had\n",
      "time to utter a cry, he was underneath the vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "A terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued.\n",
      "\n",
      "They beheld Madeleine, almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible\n",

      "together. They shouted to him, “Father Madeleine, come out!” Old\n",
      "Fauchelevent himself said to him, “Monsieur Madeleine, go away! You see\n",

      "it had become almost impossible for Madeleine to make his way from\n",
      "under the vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver, the cart rose slowly,\n",

      "effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "They rushed forwards. The devotion of a single man had given force and\n",

      "\n",
      "Madeleine rose. He was pale, though dripping with perspiration. His\n",

      "with the floor, and knocks you on the head every instant. The poor\n",

      "other corner was a butter-pot to hold water, which froze in winter, and\n",
      "in which the various levels of the water remained long marked by these\n",
      "circles of ice. She had lost her shame; she lost her coquetry. A final\n",
      "sign. She went out, with dirty caps. Whether from lack of time or from\n",
      "indifference, she no longer mended her linen. As the heels wore out,\n",
      "she dragged her stockings down into her shoes. This was evident from\n",
      "the perpendicular wrinkles. She patched her bodice, which was old and\n",
      "worn out, with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest movement.\n",
      "The people to whom she was indebted made “scenes” and gave her no\n",
      "peace. She found them in the street, she found them again on her\n",
      "staircase. She passed many a night weeping and thinking. Her eyes were\n",
      "very bright, and she felt a steady pain in her shoulder towards the top\n",
      "of the left shoulder-blade. She coughed a great deal. She deeply hated\n",
      "Father Madeleine, but made no complaint. She sewed seventeen hours a\n",
      "day; but a contractor for the work of prisons, who made the prisoners\n",
      "work at a discount, suddenly made prices fall, which reduced the daily\n",
      "earnings of working-women to nine sous. Seventeen hours of toil, and\n",
      "nine sous a day! Her creditors were more pitiless than ever. The\n",
      "second-hand dealer, who had taken back nearly all his furniture, said\n",
      "to her incessantly, “When will you pay me, you hussy?” What did they\n",
      "want of her, good God! She felt that she was being hunted, and\n",
      "something of the wild beast developed in her. About the same time,\n",
      "Thénardier wrote to her that he had waited with decidedly too much\n",
      "amiability and that he must have a hundred francs at once; otherwise he\n",
      "would turn little Cosette out of doors, convalescent as she was from\n",
      "her heavy illness, into the cold and the streets, and that she might do\n",

      "he was conscious that his police agent’s stool was a tribunal. He was\n",
      "entering judgment. He judged and condemned. He summoned all the ideas\n",
      "which could possibly exist in his mind, around the great thing which he\n",

      "society, in the person of a freeholder and an elector, insulted and\n",
      "attacked by a creature who was outside all pales. A prostitute had made\n",

      "cannot be done at that age. I am not a bad woman at bottom. It is not\n",

      "\n",
      "At the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunate\n",
      "woman, who would not rise, he emerged from the shadow, and said:—\n",

      "thrust aside the soldiers with both arms, walked straight up to M.\n",
      "Madeleine before any one could prevent her, and gazing intently at him,\n",
      "with a bewildered air, she cried:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! so it is you who are M. le Maire!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she burst into a laugh, and spit in his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Madeleine wiped his face, and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Inspector Javert, set this woman at liberty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad. He experienced at\n",
      "that moment, blow upon blow and almost simultaneously, the most violent\n",
      "emotions which he had ever undergone in all his life. To see a woman of\n",
      "the town spit in the mayor’s face was a thing so monstrous that, in his\n",
      "most daring flights of fancy, he would have regarded it as a sacrilege\n",
      "to believe it possible. On the other hand, at the very bottom of his\n",
      "thought, he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was, and as\n",
      "to what this mayor might be; and then he, with horror, caught a glimpse\n",
      "of I know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack. But\n",
      "when he beheld that mayor, that magistrate, calmly wipe his face and\n",
      "say, _“Set this woman at liberty,”_ he underwent a sort of intoxication\n",
      "of amazement; thought and word failed him equally; the sum total of\n",
      "possible astonishment had been exceeded in his case. He remained mute.\n",
      "\n",
      "The words had produced no less strange an effect on Fantine. She raised\n",
      "her bare arm, and clung to the damper of the stove, like a person who\n",
      "is reeling. Nevertheless, she glanced about her, and began to speak in\n",
      "a low voice, as though talking to herself:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“At liberty! I am to be allowed to go! I am not to go to prison for six\n",
      "months! Who said that? It is not possible that any one could have said\n",
      "that. I did not hear aright. It cannot have been that monster of a\n",
      "mayor! Was it you, my good Monsieur Javert, who said that I was to be\n",
      "set free? Oh, see here! I will tell you about it, and you will let me\n",
      "go. That monster of a mayor, that old blackguard of a mayor, is the\n",
      "cause of all. Just imagine, Monsieur Javert, he turned me out! all\n",
      "because of a pack of rascally women, who gossip in the workroom. If\n",
      "that is not a horror, what is? To dismiss a poor girl who is doing her\n",
      "work honestly! Then I could no longer earn enough, and all this misery\n",
      "followed. In the first place, there is one improvement which these\n",
      "gentlemen of the police ought to make, and that is, to prevent prison\n",
      "contractors from wronging poor people. I will explain it to you, you\n",
      "see: you are earning twelve sous at shirt-making, the price falls to\n",
      "nine sous; and it is not enough to live on. Then one has to become\n",
      "whatever one can. As for me, I had my little Cosette, and I was\n",
      "actually forced to become a bad woman. Now you understand how it is\n",
      "that that blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief. After that I\n",
      "stamped on that gentleman’s hat in front of the officers’ café; but he\n",
      "had spoiled my whole dress with snow. We women have but one silk dress\n",
      "for evening wear. You see that I did not do wrong deliberately—truly,\n",
      "Monsieur Javert; and everywhere I behold women who are far more wicked\n",
      "than I, and who are much happier. O Monsieur Javert! it was you who\n",
      "gave orders that I am to be set free, was it not? Make inquiries, speak\n",
      "to my landlord; I am paying my rent now; they will tell you that I am\n",
      "perfectly honest. Ah! my God! I beg your pardon; I have unintentionally\n",
      "touched the damper of the stove, and it has made it smoke.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Madeleine listened to her with profound attention. While she was\n",
      "speaking, he fumbled in his waistcoat, drew out his purse and opened\n",
      "it. It was empty. He put it back in his pocket. He said to Fantine,\n",
      "“How much did you say that you owed?”\n",

      "“Heed this well; she will not serve a single day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At this decisive word, Javert ventured to fix a searching look on the\n",
      "mayor and to say, but in a tone of voice that was still profoundly\n",
      "respectful:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sorry to oppose Monsieur le Maire; it is for the first time in my\n",
      "life, but he will permit me to remark that I am within the bounds of my\n",
      "authority. I confine myself, since Monsieur le Maire desires it, to the\n",
      "question of the gentleman. I was present. This woman flung herself on\n",
      "Monsieur Bamatabois, who is an elector and the proprietor of that\n",
      "handsome house with a balcony, which forms the corner of the esplanade,\n",
      "three stories high and entirely of cut stone. Such things as there are\n",
      "in the world! In any case, Monsieur le Maire, this is a question of\n",

      "this woman Fantine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then M. Madeleine folded his arms, and said in a severe voice which no\n",
      "one in the town had heard hitherto:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal\n",
      "police. According to the terms of articles nine, eleven, fifteen, and\n",
      "sixty-six of the code of criminal examination, I am the judge. I order\n",
      "that this woman shall be set at liberty.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I refer you to article eighty-one of the law of the 13th of December,\n",
      "1799, in regard to arbitrary detention.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur le Maire, permit me—”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Leave the room,” said M. Madeleine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert received the blow erect, full in the face, in his breast, like a\n",
      "Russian soldier. He bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left\n",
      "the room.\n",
      "\n",

      "passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, she also was the prey to a strange confusion. She had\n",
      "just seen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers. She\n",
      "had seen two men who held in their hands her liberty, her life, her\n",
      "soul, her child, in combat before her very eyes; one of these men was\n",
      "drawing her towards darkness, the other was leading her back towards\n",
      "the light. In this conflict, viewed through the exaggerations of\n",
      "terror, these two men had appeared to her like two giants; the one\n",
      "spoke like her demon, the other like her good angel. The angel had\n",
      "conquered the demon, and, strange to say, that which made her shudder\n",
      "from head to foot was the fact that this angel, this liberator, was the\n",
      "very man whom she abhorred, that mayor whom she had so long regarded as\n",
      "the author of all her woes, that Madeleine! And at the very moment when\n",
      "she had insulted him in so hideous a fashion, he had saved her! Had\n",
      "she, then, been mistaken? Must she change her whole soul? She did not\n",
      "know; she trembled. She listened in bewilderment, she looked on in\n",
      "affright, and at every word uttered by M. Madeleine she felt the\n",
      "frightful shades of hatred crumble and melt within her, and something\n",
      "warm and ineffable, indescribable, which was both joy, confidence and\n",
      "love, dawn in her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Javert had taken his departure, M. Madeleine turned to her and\n",
      "said to her in a deliberate voice, like a serious man who does not wish\n",
      "to weep and who finds some difficulty in speaking:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have heard you. I knew nothing about what you have mentioned. I\n",
      "believe that it is true, and I feel that it is true. I was even\n",
      "ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop. Why did you not apply\n",
      "to me? But here; I will pay your debts, I will send for your child, or\n",
      "you shall go to her. You shall live here, in Paris, or where you\n",
      "please. I undertake the care of your child and yourself. You shall not\n",
      "work any longer if you do not like. I will give all the money you\n",
      "require. You shall be honest and happy once more. And listen! I declare\n",
      "to you that if all is as you say,—and I do not doubt it,—you have never\n",
      "ceased to be virtuous and holy in the sight of God. Oh! poor woman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was more than Fantine could bear. To have Cosette! To leave this\n",
      "life of infamy. To live free, rich, happy, respectable with Cosette; to\n",
      "see all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of\n",
      "her misery. She stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her, and\n",
      "could only give vent to two or three sobs, “Oh! Oh! Oh!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Her limbs gave way beneath her, she knelt in front of M. Madeleine, and\n",

      "\n",
      "On the morrow, towards midday, Fantine awoke. She heard some one\n",
      "breathing close to her bed; she drew aside the curtain and saw M.\n",
      "Madeleine standing there and looking at something over her head. His\n",
      "gaze was full of pity, anguish, and supplication. She followed its\n",

      "“How do you feel?”\n",

      "“I was praying to the martyr there on high.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries.\n",
      "He knew all now. He knew Fantine’s history in all its heart-rending\n",
      "details. He went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have suffered much, poor mother. Oh! do not complain; you now have\n",
      "the dowry of the elect. It is thus that men are transformed into\n",
      "angels. It is not their fault they do not know how to go to work\n",

      "which two teeth were lacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "That same night, Javert wrote a letter. The next morning be posted it\n",
      "himself at the office of M. sur M. It was addressed to Paris, and the\n",
      "superscription ran: _To Monsieur Chabouillet, Secretary of Monsieur le\n",
      "Préfet of Police_. As the affair in the station-house had been bruited\n",
      "about, the post-mistress and some other persons who saw the letter\n",

      "cover, thought that he was sending in his resignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Madeleine made haste to write to the Thénardiers. Fantine owed them\n",
      "one hundred and twenty francs. He sent them three hundred francs,\n",

      "instantly to M. sur M., where her sick mother required her presence.\n",
      "\n",

      "He replied with a very well drawn-up bill for five hundred and some odd\n",

      "hundred francs,—one for the doctor, the other for the apothecary who\n",
      "had attended and physicked Éponine and Azelma through two long\n",
      "illnesses. Cosette, as we have already said, had not been ill. It was\n",
      "only a question of a trifling substitution of names. At the foot of the\n",

      "The sisters had at first only received and nursed “that woman” with\n",

      "foolish virgins. The ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajæ is\n",
      "one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity; the sisters\n",
      "felt it with the double force contributed by religion. But in a few\n",
      "days Fantine disarmed them. She said all kinds of humble and gentle\n",
      "things, and the mother in her provoked tenderness. One day the sisters\n",
      "heard her say amid her fever: “I have been a sinner; but when I have my\n",
      "child beside me, it will be a sign that God has pardoned me. While I\n",
      "was leading a bad life, I should not have liked to have my Cosette with\n",
      "me; I could not have borne her sad, astonished eyes. It was for her\n",
      "sake that I did evil, and that is why God pardons me. I shall feel the\n",
      "benediction of the good God when Cosette is here. I shall gaze at her;\n",
      "it will do me good to see that innocent creature. She knows nothing at\n",
      "all. She is an angel, you see, my sisters. At that age the wings have\n",

      "\n",
      "M. Madeleine went to see her twice a day, and each time she asked him:—\n",

      "“Shall I see my Cosette soon?”\n",
      "\n",

      "had brought about a sudden suppression of perspiration, as a\n",
      "consequence of which the malady which had been smouldering within her\n",
      "for many years was violently developed at last. At that time people\n",
      "were beginning to follow the fine Laënnec’s fine suggestions in the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” she rejoined, “he is right! But what do those Thénardiers mean by\n",

      "happiness close beside me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime Thénardier did not “let go of the child,” and gave a\n",

      "to take a journey in the winter. And then, there still remained some\n",
      "petty but pressing debts in the neighborhood, and they were collecting\n",
      "the bills for them, etc., etc.\n",

      "of police regulations. He did not disturb himself on Javert’s account.\n",
      "He could not help thinking of poor Fantine, and it suited him to be\n",

      "Javert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor, whose back was turned\n",

      "acquainted with that clear, upright, sincere, honest, austere, and\n",
      "ferocious conscience, that Javert had but just gone through some great\n",
      "interior struggle. Javert had nothing in his soul which he had not also\n",
      "in his countenance. Like violent people in general, he was subject to\n",
      "abrupt changes of opinion. His physiognomy had never been more peculiar\n",

      "paces in the rear of the mayor’s armchair, and there he stood,\n",
      "perfectly erect, in an attitude almost of discipline, with the cold,\n",
      "ingenuous roughness of a man who has never been gentle and who has\n",
      "always been patient; he waited without uttering a word, without making\n",
      "a movement, in genuine humility and tranquil resignation, calm,\n",
      "serious, hat in hand, with eyes cast down, and an expression which was\n",
      "half-way between that of a soldier in the presence of his officer and a\n",
      "criminal in the presence of his judge, until it should please the mayor\n",

      "\n",
      "“You will say that I might have handed in my resignation, but that does\n",
      "not suffice. Handing in one’s resignation is honorable. I have failed\n",
      "in my duty; I ought to be punished; I must be turned out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And after a pause he added:—\n",

      "\n",
      "“Mr. Mayor, six weeks ago, in consequence of the scene over that woman,\n",

      "“As a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“As an ex-convict.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The mayor turned livid.\n",

      "Javert, who had not raised his eyes, went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought it was so. I had had an idea for a long time; a resemblance;\n",
      "inquiries which you had caused to be made at Faverolles; the strength\n",
      "of your loins; the adventure with old Fauchelevant; your skill in\n",
      "marksmanship; your leg, which you drag a little;—I hardly know what\n",
      "all,—absurdities! But, at all events, I took you for a certain Jean\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“A certain—What did you say the name was?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jean Valjean. He was a convict whom I was in the habit of seeing\n",
      "twenty years ago, when I was adjutant-guard of convicts at Toulon. On\n",
      "leaving the galleys, this Jean Valjean, as it appears, robbed a bishop;\n",
      "then he committed another theft, accompanied with violence, on a public\n",
      "highway on the person of a little Savoyard. He disappeared eight years\n",
      "ago, no one knows how, and he has been sought, I fancied. In short, I\n",
      "did this thing! Wrath impelled me; I denounced you at the Prefecture!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Madeleine, who had taken up the docket again several moments before\n",

      "“And what reply did you receive?”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am forced to do so, since the real Jean Valjean has been found.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The sheet of paper which M. Madeleine was holding dropped from his\n",
      "hand; he raised his head, gazed fixedly at Javert, and said with his\n",
      "indescribable accent:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert continued:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is the way it is, Mr. Mayor. It seems that there was in the\n",
      "neighborhood near Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher an old fellow who was called\n",
      "Father Champmathieu. He was a very wretched creature. No one paid any\n",
      "attention to him. No one knows what such people subsist on. Lately,\n",
      "last autumn, Father Champmathieu was arrested for the theft of some\n",
      "cider apples from—Well, no matter, a theft had been committed, a wall\n",
      "scaled, branches of trees broken. My Champmathieu was arrested. He\n",
      "still had the branch of apple-tree in his hand. The scamp is locked up.\n",
      "Up to this point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor. But here is\n",
      "where Providence intervened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The jail being in a bad condition, the examining magistrate finds it\n",
      "convenient to transfer Champmathieu to Arras, where the departmental\n",
      "prison is situated. In this prison at Arras there is an ex-convict\n",
      "named Brevet, who is detained for I know not what, and who has been\n",
      "appointed turnkey of the house, because of good behavior. Mr. Mayor, no\n",
      "sooner had Champmathieu arrived than Brevet exclaims: ‘Eh! Why, I know\n",
      "that man! He is a _fagot!_4 Take a good look at me, my good man! You\n",
      "are Jean Valjean!’ ‘Jean Valjean! who’s Jean Valjean?’ Champmathieu\n",
      "feigns astonishment. ‘Don’t play the innocent dodge,’ says Brevet. ‘You\n",
      "are Jean Valjean! You have been in the galleys of Toulon; it was twenty\n",
      "years ago; we were there together.’ Champmathieu denies it. Parbleu!\n",
      "You understand. The case is investigated. The thing was well ventilated\n",
      "for me. This is what they discovered: This Champmathieu had been,\n",
      "thirty years ago, a pruner of trees in various localities, notably at\n",
      "Faverolles. There all trace of him was lost. A long time afterwards he\n",
      "was seen again in Auvergne; then in Paris, where he is said to have\n",
      "been a wheelwright, and to have had a daughter, who was a laundress;\n",
      "but that has not been proved. Now, before going to the galleys for\n",
      "theft, what was Jean Valjean? A pruner of trees. Where? At Faverolles.\n",
      "Another fact. This Valjean’s Christian name was Jean, and his mother’s\n",
      "surname was Mathieu. What more natural to suppose than that, on\n",
      "emerging from the galleys, he should have taken his mother’s name for\n",
      "the purpose of concealing himself, and have called himself Jean\n",
      "Mathieu? He goes to Auvergne. The local pronunciation turns _Jean_ into\n",
      "_Chan_—he is called Chan Mathieu. Our man offers no opposition, and\n",
      "behold him transformed into Champmathieu. You follow me, do you not?\n",
      "Inquiries were made at Faverolles. The family of Jean Valjean is no\n",
      "longer there. It is not known where they have gone. You know that among\n",
      "those classes a family often disappears. Search was made, and nothing\n",
      "was found. When such people are not mud, they are dust. And then, as\n",
      "the beginning of the story dates thirty years back, there is no longer\n",
      "any one at Faverolles who knew Jean Valjean. Inquiries were made at\n",
      "Toulon. Besides Brevet, there are only two convicts in existence who\n",
      "have seen Jean Valjean; they are Cochepaille and Chenildieu, and are\n",
      "sentenced for life. They are taken from the galleys and confronted with\n",
      "the pretended Champmathieu. They do not hesitate; he is Jean Valjean\n",
      "for them as well as for Brevet. The same age,—he is fifty-four,—the\n",
      "same height, the same air, the same man; in short, it is he. It was\n",
      "precisely at this moment that I forwarded my denunciation to the\n",
      "Prefecture in Paris. I was told that I had lost my reason, and that\n",
      "Jean Valjean is at Arras, in the power of the authorities. You can\n",
      "imagine whether this surprised me, when I thought that I had that same\n",
      "Jean Valjean here. I write to the examining judge; he sends for me;\n",
      "Champmathieu is conducted to me—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?” interposed M. Madeleine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert replied, his face incorruptible, and as melancholy as ever:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Mayor, the truth is the truth. I am sorry; but that man is Jean\n",
      "Valjean. I recognized him also.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Madeleine resumed in, a very low voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are sure?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert began to laugh, with that mournful laugh which comes from\n",
      "profound conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O! Sure!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood there thoughtfully for a moment, mechanically taking pinches\n",
      "of powdered wood for blotting ink from the wooden bowl which stood on\n",
      "the table, and he added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“And even now that I have seen the real Jean Valjean, I do not see how\n",
      "I could have thought otherwise. I beg your pardon, Mr. Mayor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert, as he addressed these grave and supplicating words to the man,\n",
      "who six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the whole\n",
      "station-house, and bade him “leave the room,”—Javert, that haughty man,\n",
      "was unconsciously full of simplicity and dignity,—M. Madeleine made no\n",
      "other reply to his prayer than the abrupt question:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what does this man say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! Indeed, Mr. Mayor, it’s a bad business. If he is Jean Valjean, he\n",
      "has his previous conviction against him. To climb a wall, to break a\n",
      "branch, to purloin apples, is a mischievous trick in a child; for a man\n",
      "it is a misdemeanor; for a convict it is a crime. Robbing and\n",
      "housebreaking—it is all there. It is no longer a question of\n",
      "correctional police; it is a matter for the Court of Assizes. It is no\n",
      "longer a matter of a few days in prison; it is the galleys for life.\n",
      "And then, there is the affair with the little Savoyard, who will\n",
      "return, I hope. The deuce! there is plenty to dispute in the matter, is\n",
      "there not? Yes, for any one but Jean Valjean. But Jean Valjean is a sly\n",
      "dog. That is the way I recognized him. Any other man would have felt\n",
      "that things were getting hot for him; he would struggle, he would cry\n",
      "out—the kettle sings before the fire; he would not be Jean Valjean, _et\n",
      "cetera_. But he has not the appearance of understanding; he says, ‘I am\n",
      "Champmathieu, and I won’t depart from that!’ He has an astonished air,\n",
      "he pretends to be stupid; it is far better. Oh! the rogue is clever!\n",
      "But it makes no difference. The proofs are there. He has been\n",
      "recognized by four persons; the old scamp will be condemned. The case\n",
      "has been taken to the Assizes at Arras. I shall go there to give my\n",
      "testimony. I have been summoned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Madeleine had turned to his desk again, and taken up his docket, and\n",
      "was turning over the leaves tranquilly, reading and writing by turns,\n",
      "like a busy man. He turned to Javert:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“That will do, Javert. In truth, all these details interest me but\n",
      "little. We are wasting our time, and we have pressing business on hand.\n",
      "Javert, you will betake yourself at once to the house of the woman\n",
      "Buseaupied, who sells herbs at the corner of the Rue Saint-Saulve. You\n",
      "will tell her that she must enter her complaint against carter Pierre\n",
      "Chesnelong. The man is a brute, who came near crushing this woman and\n",
      "her child. He must be punished. You will then go to M. Charcellay, Rue\n",
      "Montre-de-Champigny. He complained that there is a gutter on the\n",
      "adjoining house which discharges rain-water on his premises, and is\n",
      "undermining the foundations of his house. After that, you will verify\n",
      "the infractions of police regulations which have been reported to me in\n",
      "the Rue Guibourg, at Widow Doris’s, and Rue du Garraud-Blanc, at Madame\n",
      "Renée le Bossé’s, and you will prepare documents. But I am giving you a\n",
      "great deal of work. Are you not to be absent? Did you not tell me that\n",
      "you were going to Arras on that matter in a week or ten days?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sooner than that, Mr. Mayor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“On what day, then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, I thought that I had said to Monsieur le Maire that the case was\n",
      "to be tried to-morrow, and that I am to set out by diligence to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Madeleine made an imperceptible movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how long will the case last?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“One day, at the most. The judgment will be pronounced to-morrow\n",
      "evening at latest. But I shall not wait for the sentence, which is\n",
      "certain; I shall return here as soon as my deposition has been taken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is well,” said M. Madeleine.\n",

      "Javert did not withdraw.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me, Mr. Mayor,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it now?” demanded M. Madeleine.\n",

      "“Mr. Mayor, there is still something of which I must remind you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I must be dismissed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Madeleine rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Javert, you are a man of honor, and I esteem you. You exaggerate your\n",
      "fault. Moreover, this is an offence which concerns me. Javert, you\n",
      "deserve promotion instead of degradation. I wish you to retain your\n",
      "post.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert gazed at M. Madeleine with his candid eyes, in whose depths his\n",
      "not very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible, and\n",
      "said in a tranquil voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Mayor, I cannot grant you that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I repeat,” replied M. Madeleine, “that the matter concerns me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But Javert, heeding his own thought only, continued:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“So far as exaggeration is concerned, I am not exaggerating. This is\n",
      "the way I reason: I have suspected you unjustly. That is nothing. It is\n",
      "our right to cherish suspicion, although suspicion directed above\n",
      "ourselves is an abuse. But without proofs, in a fit of rage, with the\n",
      "object of wreaking my vengeance, I have denounced you as a convict,\n",
      "you, a respectable man, a mayor, a magistrate! That is serious, very\n",
      "serious. I have insulted authority in your person, I, an agent of the\n",
      "authorities! If one of my subordinates had done what I have done, I\n",
      "should have declared him unworthy of the service, and have expelled\n",
      "him. Well? Stop, Mr. Mayor; one word more. I have often been severe in\n",
      "the course of my life towards others. That is just. I have done well.\n",
      "Now, if I were not severe towards myself, all the justice that I have\n",
      "done would become injustice. Ought I to spare myself more than others?\n",
      "No! What! I should be good for nothing but to chastise others, and not\n",
      "myself! Why, I should be a blackguard! Those who say, ‘That blackguard\n",
      "of a Javert!’ would be in the right. Mr. Mayor, I do not desire that\n",
      "you should treat me kindly; your kindness roused sufficient bad blood\n",
      "in me when it was directed to others. I want none of it for myself. The\n",
      "kindness which consists in upholding a woman of the town against a\n",
      "citizen, the police agent against the mayor, the man who is down\n",
      "against the man who is up in the world, is what I call false kindness.\n",
      "That is the sort of kindness which disorganizes society. Good God! it\n",
      "is very easy to be kind; the difficulty lies in being just. Come! if\n",
      "you had been what I thought you, I should not have been kind to you,\n",
      "not I! You would have seen! Mr. Mayor, I must treat myself as I would\n",
      "treat any other man. When I have subdued malefactors, when I have\n",
      "proceeded with vigor against rascals, I have often said to myself, ‘If\n",
      "you flinch, if I ever catch you in fault, you may rest at your ease!’ I\n",
      "have flinched, I have caught myself in a fault. So much the worse!\n",
      "Come, discharged, cashiered, expelled! That is well. I have arms. I\n",
      "will till the soil; it makes no difference to me. Mr. Mayor, the good\n",
      "of the service demands an example. I simply require the discharge of\n",
      "Inspector Javert.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All this was uttered in a proud, humble, despairing, yet convinced\n",
      "tone, which lent indescribable grandeur to this singular, honest man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We shall see,” said M. Madeleine.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he offered him his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert recoiled, and said in a wild voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but this must not be. A mayor does not offer his\n",
      "hand to a police spy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He added between his teeth:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“A police spy, yes; from the moment when I have misused the police. I\n",
      "am no more than a police spy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he bowed profoundly, and directed his steps towards the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "There he wheeled round, and with eyes still downcast:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Mayor,” he said, “I shall continue to serve until I am\n",
      "superseded.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He withdrew. M. Madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm,\n",

      "Sister Simplice was white, with a waxen pallor. Beside Sister Perpétue,\n",
      "she was the taper beside the candle. Vincent de Paul has divinely\n",
      "traced the features of the Sister of Charity in these admirable words,\n",
      "in which he mingles as much freedom as servitude: “They shall have for\n",
      "their convent only the house of the sick; for cell only a hired room;\n",
      "for chapel only their parish church; for cloister only the streets of\n",
      "the town and the wards of the hospitals; for enclosure only obedience;\n",
      "for gratings only the fear of God; for veil only modesty.” This ideal\n",
      "was realized in the living person of Sister Simplice: she had never\n",
      "been young, and it seemed as though she would never grow old. No one\n",
      "could have told Sister Simplice’s age. She was a person—we dare not say\n",
      "a woman—who was gentle, austere, well-bred, cold, and who had never\n",
      "lied. She was so gentle that she appeared fragile; but she was more\n",
      "solid than granite. She touched the unhappy with fingers that were\n",
      "charmingly pure and fine. There was, so to speak, silence in her\n",
      "speech; she said just what was necessary, and she possessed a tone of\n",
      "voice which would have equally edified a confessional or enchanted a\n",
      "drawing-room. This delicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown,\n",
      "finding in this harsh contact a continual reminder of heaven and of\n",

      "said, for any interest whatever, even in indifference, any single thing\n",
      "which was not the truth, the sacred truth, was Sister Simplice’s\n",
      "distinctive trait; it was the accent of her virtue. She was almost\n",

      "However pure and sincere we may be, we all bear upon our candor the\n",

      "lie—does such a thing exist? To lie is the absolute form of evil. To\n",
      "lie a little is not possible: he who lies, lies the whole lie. To lie\n",
      "is the very face of the demon. Satan has two names; he is called Satan\n",
      "and Lying. That is what she thought; and as she thought, so she did.\n",
      "The result was the whiteness which we have mentioned—a whiteness which\n",
      "covered even her lips and her eyes with radiance. Her smile was white,\n",
      "her glance was white. There was not a single spider’s web, not a grain\n",
      "of dust, on the glass window of that conscience. On entering the order\n",
      "of Saint Vincent de Paul, she had taken the name of Simplice by special\n",

      "Sister Simplice, on her entrance into the order, had had two faults\n",

      "priest’s house he halted, stood motionless, then turned about, and\n",
      "retraced his steps to the door of the parsonage, which had an iron\n",
      "knocker. He laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it; then he\n",
      "paused again and stopped short, as though in thought, and after the\n",
      "lapse of a few seconds, instead of allowing the knocker to fall\n",
      "abruptly, he placed it gently, and resumed his way with a sort of haste\n",

      "been a temptation for him, and he had wished to avoid it. He ascended\n",
      "to his room, and there he shut himself up, which was a very simple act,\n",
      "since he liked to go to bed early. Nevertheless, the portress of the\n",
      "factory, who was, at the same time, M. Madeleine’s only servant,\n",
      "noticed that the latter’s light was extinguished at half-past eight,\n",

      "to sleep. Towards midnight he woke up with a start; in his sleep he had\n",
      "heard a noise above his head. He listened; it was a footstep pacing\n",
      "back and forth, as though some one were walking in the room above him.\n",
      "He listened more attentively, and recognized M. Madeleine’s step. This\n",
      "struck him as strange; usually, there was no noise in M. Madeleine’s\n",
      "chamber until he rose in the morning. A moment later the cashier heard\n",
      "a noise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened, and then shut\n",
      "again; then a piece of furniture was disarranged; then a pause ensued;\n",
      "then the step began again. The cashier sat up in bed, quite awake now,\n",
      "and staring; and through his window-panes he saw the reddish gleam of a\n",
      "lighted window reflected on the opposite wall; from the direction of\n",
      "the rays, it could only come from the window of M. Madeleine’s chamber.\n",
      "The reflection wavered, as though it came rather from a fire which had\n",
      "been lighted than from a candle. The shadow of the window-frame was not\n",
      "shown, which indicated that the window was wide open. The fact that\n",
      "this window was open in such cold weather was surprising. The cashier\n",
      "fell asleep again. An hour or two later he waked again. The same step\n",
      "was still passing slowly and regularly back and forth overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reflection was still visible on the wall, but now it was pale and\n",

      "M., happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past and the first\n",
      "half of his existence belied by the last, he lived in peace, reassured\n",
      "and hopeful, having henceforth only two thoughts,—to conceal his name\n",
      "and to sanctify his life; to escape men and to return to God.\n",
      "\n",
      "These two thoughts were so closely intertwined in his mind that they\n",
      "formed but a single one there; both were equally absorbing and\n",
      "imperative and ruled his slightest actions. In general, they conspired\n",
      "to regulate the conduct of his life; they turned him towards the gloom;\n",
      "they rendered him kindly and simple; they counselled him to the same\n",
      "things. Sometimes, however, they conflicted. In that case, as the\n",
      "reader will remember, the man whom all the country of M. sur M. called\n",
      "M. Madeleine did not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second—his\n",
      "security to his virtue. Thus, in spite of all his reserve and all his\n",
      "prudence, he had preserved the Bishop’s candlesticks, worn mourning for\n",
      "him, summoned and interrogated all the little Savoyards who passed that\n",
      "way, collected information regarding the families at Faverolles, and\n",
      "saved old Fauchelevent’s life, despite the disquieting insinuations of\n",

      "At the same time, it must be confessed, nothing just like this had yet\n",

      "\n",
      "Never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferings\n",
      "we are narrating, engaged in so serious a struggle. He understood this\n",
      "confusedly but profoundly at the very first words pronounced by Javert,\n",
      "when the latter entered his study. At the moment when that name, which\n",
      "he had buried beneath so many layers, was so strangely articulated, he\n",
      "was struck with stupor, and as though intoxicated with the sinister\n",
      "eccentricity of his destiny; and through this stupor he felt that\n",
      "shudder which precedes great shocks. He bent like an oak at the\n",
      "approach of a storm, like a soldier at the approach of an assault. He\n",
      "felt shadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending upon his\n",
      "head. As he listened to Javert, the first thought which occurred to him\n",
      "was to go, to run and denounce himself, to take that Champmathieu out\n",
      "of prison and place himself there; this was as painful and as poignant\n",
      "as an incision in the living flesh. Then it passed away, and he said to\n",
      "himself, “We will see! We will see!” He repressed this first, generous\n",
      "instinct, and recoiled before heroism.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be beautiful, no doubt, after the Bishop’s holy words, after\n",
      "so many years of repentance and abnegation, in the midst of a penitence\n",
      "admirably begun, if this man had not flinched for an instant, even in\n",
      "the presence of so terrible a conjecture, but had continued to walk\n",
      "with the same step towards this yawning precipice, at the bottom of\n",
      "which lay heaven; that would have been beautiful; but it was not thus.\n",
      "We must render an account of the things which went on in this soul, and\n",
      "we can only tell what there was there. He was carried away, at first,\n",
      "by the instinct of self-preservation; he rallied all his ideas in\n",
      "haste, stifled his emotions, took into consideration Javert’s presence,\n",
      "that great danger, postponed all decision with the firmness of terror,\n",
      "shook off thought as to what he had to do, and resumed his calmness as\n",
      "a warrior picks up his buckler.\n",
      "\n",
      "He remained in this state during the rest of the day, a whirlwind\n",
      "within, a profound tranquillity without. He took no “preservative\n",
      "measures,” as they may be called. Everything was still confused, and\n",
      "jostling together in his brain. His trouble was so great that he could\n",
      "not perceive the form of a single idea distinctly, and he could have\n",
      "told nothing about himself, except that he had received a great blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "He repaired to Fantine’s bed of suffering, as usual, and prolonged his\n",
      "visit, through a kindly instinct, telling himself that he must behave\n",
      "thus, and recommend her well to the sisters, in case he should be\n",
      "obliged to be absent himself. He had a vague feeling that he might be\n",
      "obliged to go to Arras; and without having the least in the world made\n",
      "up his mind to this trip, he said to himself that being, as he was,\n",
      "beyond the shadow of any suspicion, there could be nothing out of the\n",
      "way in being a witness to what was to take place, and he engaged the\n",
      "tilbury from Scaufflaire in order to be prepared in any event.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "On returning to his room, he communed with himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He examined the situation, and found it unprecedented; so unprecedented\n",
      "that in the midst of his reverie he rose from his chair, moved by some\n",
      "inexplicable impulse of anxiety, and bolted his door. He feared lest\n",
      "something more should enter. He was barricading himself against\n",

      "\n",
      "His conscience; that is to say, God.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, he deluded himself at first; he had a feeling of security\n",
      "and of solitude; the bolt once drawn, he thought himself impregnable;\n",
      "the candle extinguished, he felt himself invisible. Then he took\n",
      "possession of himself: he set his elbows on the table, leaned his head\n",
      "on his hand, and began to meditate in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where do I stand? Am not I dreaming? What have I heard? Is it really\n",
      "true that I have seen that Javert, and that he spoke to me in that\n",
      "manner? Who can that Champmathieu be? So he resembles me! Is it\n",
      "possible? When I reflect that yesterday I was so tranquil, and so far\n",
      "from suspecting anything! What was I doing yesterday at this hour? What\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the torment in which he found himself. His brain had lost its\n",

      "brow in both hands to arrest them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which\n",
      "overwhelmed his will and his reason, and from which he sought to draw\n",
      "proof and resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "His head was burning. He went to the window and threw it wide open.\n",
      "There were no stars in the sky. He returned and seated himself at the\n",

      "\n",
      "The first hour passed in this manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gradually, however, vague outlines began to take form and to fix\n",
      "themselves in his meditation, and he was able to catch a glimpse with\n",
      "precision of the reality,—not the whole situation, but some of the\n",
      "details. He began by recognizing the fact that, critical and\n",
      "extraordinary as was this situation, he was completely master of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This only caused an increase of his stupor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Independently of the severe and religious aim which he had assigned to\n",
      "his actions, all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but a\n",
      "hole in which to bury his name. That which he had always feared most of\n",
      "all in his hours of self-communion, during his sleepless nights, was to\n",
      "ever hear that name pronounced; he had said to himself, that that would\n",
      "be the end of all things for him; that on the day when that name made\n",
      "its reappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from about him,\n",
      "and—who knows?—perhaps even his new soul within him, also. He shuddered\n",
      "at the very thought that this was possible. Assuredly, if any one had\n",
      "said to him at such moments that the hour would come when that name\n",
      "would ring in his ears, when the hideous words, Jean Valjean, would\n",
      "suddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him, when that\n",
      "formidable light, capable of dissipating the mystery in which he had\n",
      "enveloped himself, would suddenly blaze forth above his head, and that\n",
      "that name would not menace him, that that light would but produce an\n",
      "obscurity more dense, that this rent veil would but increase the\n",
      "mystery, that this earthquake would solidify his edifice, that this\n",
      "prodigious incident would have no other result, so far as he was\n",
      "concerned, if so it seemed good to him, than that of rendering his\n",
      "existence at once clearer and more impenetrable, and that, out of his\n",
      "confrontation with the phantom of Jean Valjean, the good and worthy\n",
      "citizen Monsieur Madeleine would emerge more honored, more peaceful,\n",
      "and more respected than ever—if any one had told him that, he would\n",
      "have tossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman. Well,\n",
      "all this was precisely what had just come to pass; all that\n",
      "accumulation of impossibilities was a fact, and God had permitted these\n",
      "wild fancies to become real things!\n",
      "\n",
      "His reverie continued to grow clearer. He came more and more to an\n",
      "understanding of his position.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to him that he had but just waked up from some inexplicable\n",
      "dream, and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the\n",
      "middle of the night, erect, shivering, holding back all in vain, on the\n",
      "very brink of the abyss. He distinctly perceived in the darkness a\n",
      "stranger, a man unknown to him, whom destiny had mistaken for him, and\n",
      "whom she was thrusting into the gulf in his stead; in order that the\n",
      "gulf might close once more, it was necessary that some one, himself or\n",
      "that other man, should fall into it: he had only let things take their\n",
      "course.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light became complete, and he acknowledged this to himself: That\n",
      "his place was empty in the galleys; that do what he would, it was still\n",
      "awaiting him; that the theft from little Gervais had led him back to\n",
      "it; that this vacant place would await him, and draw him on until he\n",
      "filled it; that this was inevitable and fatal; and then he said to\n",
      "himself, “that, at this moment, he had a substitute; that it appeared\n",
      "that a certain Champmathieu had that ill luck, and that, as regards\n",
      "himself, being present in the galleys in the person of that\n",
      "Champmathieu, present in society under the name of M. Madeleine, he had\n",
      "nothing more to fear, provided that he did not prevent men from sealing\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All this was so strange and so violent, that there suddenly took place\n",

      "conscience which stirs up all that there is doubtful in the heart,\n",
      "which is composed of irony, of joy, and of despair, and which may be\n",
      "called an outburst of inward laughter.\n",
      "\n",

      "everywhere; that frightful hunting-dog, always making a point at me, is\n",
      "thrown off the scent, engaged elsewhere, absolutely turned from the\n",
      "trail: henceforth he is satisfied; he will leave me in peace; he has\n",
      "his Jean Valjean. Who knows? it is even probable that he will wish to\n",
      "leave town! And all this has been brought about without any aid from\n",
      "me, and I count for nothing in it! Ah! but where is the misfortune in\n",
      "this? Upon my honor, people would think, to see me, that some\n",
      "catastrophe had happened to me! After all, if it does bring harm to\n",
      "some one, that is not my fault in the least: it is Providence which has\n",
      "done it all; it is because it wishes it so to be, evidently. Have I the\n",
      "right to disarrange what it has arranged? What do I ask now? Why should\n",
      "I meddle? It does not concern me; what! I am not satisfied: but what\n",
      "more do I want? The goal to which I have aspired for so many years, the\n",
      "dream of my nights, the object of my prayers to Heaven,—security,—I\n",
      "have now attained; it is God who wills it; I can do nothing against the\n",

      "what I have begun, that I may do good, that I may one day be a grand\n",

      "happiness has been attached to the penance which I have undergone, and\n",
      "to that virtue to which I have returned. Really, I do not understand\n",
      "why I was afraid, a little while ago, to enter the house of that good\n",
      "curé, and to ask his advice; this is evidently what he would have said\n",

      "good once more; to be a just man? Was it not that above all, that\n",
      "alone, which he had always desired, which the Bishop had enjoined upon\n",
      "him—to shut the door on his past? But he was not shutting it! great\n",

      "sunshine. He was becoming an assassin. He was murdering, morally\n",
      "murdering, a wretched man. He was inflicting on him that frightful\n",

      "truth, to achieve his resurrection, and to close forever that hell\n",

      "that henceforth Mayor Madeleine, with all his virtues, would be\n",
      "abominable to him, and that the convict Jean Valjean would be pure and\n",
      "admirable in his sight; that men beheld his mask, but that the Bishop\n",

      "midst of the darkness and the lights, a goddess and a giant contending.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was filled with terror; but it seemed to him that the good thought\n",
      "was getting the upper hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of his\n",
      "conscience and of his destiny; that the Bishop had marked the first\n",
      "phase of his new life, and that Champmathieu marked the second. After\n",
      "the grand crisis, the grand test.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the fever, allayed for an instant, gradually resumed possession of\n",
      "him. A thousand thoughts traversed his mind, but they continued to\n",
      "fortify him in his resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "One moment he said to himself that he was, perhaps, taking the matter\n",
      "too keenly; that, after all, this Champmathieu was not interesting, and\n",
      "that he had actually been guilty of theft.\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered himself: “If this man has, indeed, stolen a few apples,\n",
      "that means a month in prison. It is a long way from that to the\n",
      "galleys. And who knows? Did he steal? Has it been proved? The name of\n",
      "Jean Valjean overwhelms him, and seems to dispense with proofs. Do not\n",
      "the attorneys for the Crown always proceed in this manner? He is\n",
      "supposed to be a thief because he is known to be a convict.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In another instant the thought had occurred to him that, when he\n",
      "denounced himself, the heroism of his deed might, perhaps, be taken\n",
      "into consideration, and his honest life for the last seven years, and\n",
      "what he had done for the district, and that they would have mercy on\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this supposition vanished very quickly, and he smiled bitterly as\n",
      "he remembered that the theft of the forty sous from little Gervais put\n",
      "him in the position of a man guilty of a second offence after\n",
      "conviction, that this affair would certainly come up, and, according to\n",
      "the precise terms of the law, would render him liable to penal\n",
      "servitude for life.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned aside from all illusions, detached himself more and more from\n",
      "earth, and sought strength and consolation elsewhere. He told himself\n",
      "that he must do his duty; that perhaps he should not be more unhappy\n",
      "after doing his duty than after having avoided it; that if he _allowed\n",
      "things to take their own course_, if he remained at M. sur M., his\n",
      "consideration, his good name, his good works, the deference and\n",
      "veneration paid to him, his charity, his wealth, his popularity, his\n",
      "virtue, would be seasoned with a crime. And what would be the taste of\n",
      "all these holy things when bound up with this hideous thing? while, if\n",
      "he accomplished his sacrifice, a celestial idea would be mingled with\n",
      "the galleys, the post, the iron necklet, the green cap, unceasing toil,\n",
      "and pitiless shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length he told himself that it must be so, that his destiny was thus\n",
      "allotted, that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made on\n",
      "high, that, in any case, he must make his choice: virtue without and\n",
      "abomination within, or holiness within and infamy without.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his courage to\n",
      "fail, but his brain grow weary. He began to think of other things, of\n",
      "indifferent matters, in spite of himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The veins in his temples throbbed violently; he still paced to and fro;\n",
      "midnight sounded first from the parish church, then from the town-hall;\n",
      "he counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks, and compared the\n",
      "sounds of the two bells; he recalled in this connection the fact that,\n",
      "a few days previously, he had seen in an ironmonger’s shop an ancient\n",

      "Romainville_.\n",

      "the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor; he was obliged to make\n",
      "a tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the subject of his\n",
      "thoughts before midnight had struck; he finally succeeded in doing\n",
      "this.\n",

      "\n",
      "Fantine, by appearing thus abruptly in his reverie, produced the effect\n",
      "of an unexpected ray of light; it seemed to him as though everything\n",

      "\n",
      "“Ah! but I have hitherto considered no one but myself; it is proper for\n",
      "me to hold my tongue or to denounce myself, to conceal my person or to\n",
      "save my soul, to be a despicable and respected magistrate, or an\n",
      "infamous and venerable convict; it is I, it is always I and nothing but\n",
      "I: but, good God! all this is egotism; these are diverse forms of\n",
      "egotism, but it is egotism all the same. What if I were to think a\n",
      "little about others? The highest holiness is to think of others; come,\n",
      "let us examine the matter. The _I_ excepted, the _I_ effaced, the _I_\n",
      "forgotten, what would be the result of all this? What if I denounce\n",
      "myself? I am arrested; this Champmathieu is released; I am put back in\n",
      "the galleys; that is well—and what then? What is going on here? Ah!\n",
      "here is a country, a town, here are factories, an industry, workers,\n",
      "both men and women, aged grandsires, children, poor people! All this I\n",
      "have created; all these I provide with their living; everywhere where\n",
      "there is a smoking chimney, it is I who have placed the brand on the\n",
      "hearth and meat in the pot; I have created ease, circulation, credit;\n",
      "before me there was nothing; I have elevated, vivified, informed with\n",

      "of her fall; the cause of all whose misery I have unwittingly been! And\n",

      "“Well, this man is going to the galleys; it is true, but what the\n",

      "guilty of theft, for he has! I remain here; I go on: in ten years I\n",

      "a whole country rich and honest! Ah! I was a fool! I was absurd! what\n",
      "was that I was saying about denouncing myself? I really must pay\n",
      "attention and not be precipitate about anything. What! because it would\n",
      "have pleased me to play the grand and generous; this is melodrama,\n",
      "after all; because I should have thought of no one but myself, the\n",
      "idea! for the sake of saving from a punishment, a trifle exaggerated,\n",
      "perhaps, but just at bottom, no one knows whom, a thief, a\n",
      "good-for-nothing, evidently, a whole country-side must perish! a poor\n",

      "\n",
      "“Is there any one here?” he demanded aloud, in utter bewilderment.\n",

      "by change of place. After the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knew\n",
      "his position.\n",
      "\n",
      "He now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which he\n",

      "equally fatal. What a fatality! What conjunction that that Champmathieu\n",
      "should have been taken for him; to be overwhelmed by precisely the\n",
      "means which Providence seemed to have employed, at first, to strengthen\n",
      "his position!\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a moment when he reflected on the future. Denounce himself,\n",
      "great God! Deliver himself up! With immense despair he faced all that\n",

      "once more. He should have to bid farewell to that existence which was\n",
      "so good, so pure, so radiant, to the respect of all, to honor, to\n",
      "liberty. He should never more stroll in the fields; he should never\n",
      "more hear the birds sing in the month of May; he should never more\n",
      "bestow alms on the little children; he should never more experience the\n",
      "sweetness of having glances of gratitude and love fixed upon him; he\n",
      "should quit that house which he had built, that little chamber!\n",
      "Everything seemed charming to him at that moment. Never again should he\n",
      "read those books; never more should he write on that little table of\n",
      "white wood; his old portress, the only servant whom he kept, would\n",
      "never more bring him his coffee in the morning. Great God! instead of\n",
      "that, the convict gang, the iron necklet, the red waistcoat, the chain\n",
      "on his ankle, fatigue, the cell, the camp bed all those horrors which\n",
      "he knew so well! At his age, after having been what he was! If he were\n",
      "only young again! but to be addressed in his old age as “thou” by any\n",
      "one who pleased; to be searched by the convict-guard; to receive the\n",
      "galley-sergeant’s cudgellings; to wear iron-bound shoes on his bare\n",
      "feet; to have to stretch out his leg night and morning to the hammer of\n",

      "The posting service from Arras to M. sur M. was still operated at this\n",
      "period by small mail-wagons of the time of the Empire. These\n",
      "mail-wagons were two-wheeled cabriolets, upholstered inside with\n",
      "fawn-colored leather, hung on springs, and having but two seats, one\n",
      "for the postboy, the other for the traveller. The wheels were armed\n",
      "with those long, offensive axles which keep other vehicles at a\n",
      "distance, and which may still be seen on the road in Germany. The\n",
      "despatch box, an immense oblong coffer, was placed behind the vehicle\n",
      "and formed a part of it. This coffer was painted black, and the\n",
      "cabriolet yellow.\n",
      "\n",
      "These vehicles, which have no counterparts nowadays, had something\n",
      "distorted and hunchbacked about them; and when one saw them passing in\n",
      "the distance, and climbing up some road to the horizon, they resembled\n",
      "the insects which are called, I think, termites, and which, though with\n",
      "but little corselet, drag a great train behind them. But they travelled\n",
      "at a very rapid rate. The post-wagon which set out from Arras at one\n",
      "o’clock every night, after the mail from Paris had passed, arrived at\n",
      "M. sur M. a little before five o’clock in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night the wagon which was descending to M. sur M. by the Hesdin\n",
      "road, collided at the corner of a street, just as it was entering the\n",
      "town, with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse, which was going\n",
      "in the opposite direction, and in which there was but one person, a man\n",
      "enveloped in a mantle. The wheel of the tilbury received quite a\n",
      "violent shock. The postman shouted to the man to stop, but the\n",
      "traveller paid no heed and pursued his road at full gallop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That man is in a devilish hurry!” said the postman.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling\n",
      "in convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whither was he going? He could not have told. Why was he hastening? He\n",
      "did not know. He was driving at random, straight ahead. Whither? To\n",
      "Arras, no doubt; but he might have been going elsewhere as well. At\n",
      "times he was conscious of it, and he shuddered. He plunged into the\n",
      "night as into a gulf. Something urged him forward; something drew him\n",
      "on. No one could have told what was taking place within him; every one\n",
      "will understand it. What man is there who has not entered, at least\n",
      "once in his life, into that obscure cavern of the unknown?\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he had resolved on nothing, decided nothing, formed no plan,\n",
      "done nothing. None of the actions of his conscience had been decisive.\n",
      "He was, more than ever, as he had been at the first moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why was he going to Arras?\n",
      "\n",
      "He repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hired\n",
      "Scaufflaire’s cabriolet: that, whatever the result was to be, there was\n",
      "no reason why he should not see with his own eyes, and judge of matters\n",
      "for himself; that this was even prudent; that he must know what took\n",
      "place; that no decision could be arrived at without having observed and\n",
      "scrutinized; that one made mountains out of everything from a distance;\n",
      "that, at any rate, when he should have seen that Champmathieu, some\n",
      "wretch, his conscience would probably be greatly relieved to allow him\n",
      "to go to the galleys in his stead; that Javert would indeed be there;\n",
      "and that Brevet, that Chenildieu, that Cochepaille, old convicts who\n",
      "had known him; but they certainly would not recognize him;—bah! what an\n",
      "idea! that Javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth; that\n",
      "all conjectures and all suppositions were fixed on Champmathieu, and\n",
      "that there is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures;\n",
      "that accordingly there was no danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "That it was, no doubt, a dark moment, but that he should emerge from\n",
      "it; that, after all, he held his destiny, however bad it might be, in\n",
      "his own hand; that he was master of it. He clung to this thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "At bottom, to tell the whole truth, he would have preferred not to go\n",
      "to Arras.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, he was going thither.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he meditated, he whipped up his horse, which was proceeding at that\n",
      "fine, regular, and even trot which accomplishes two leagues and a half\n",
      "an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "In proportion as the cabriolet advanced, he felt something within him\n",
      "draw back.\n",
      "\n",
      "At daybreak he was in the open country; the town of M. sur M. lay far\n",
      "behind him. He watched the horizon grow white; he stared at all the\n",
      "chilly figures of a winter’s dawn as they passed before his eyes, but\n",
      "without seeing them. The morning has its spectres as well as the\n",
      "evening. He did not see them; but without his being aware of it, and by\n",
      "means of a sort of penetration which was almost physical, these black\n",
      "silhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and sinister\n",
      "quality to the violent state of his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which\n",
      "sometimes border on the highway, he said to himself, “And yet there are\n",
      "people there within who are sleeping!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The trot of the horse, the bells on the harness, the wheels on the\n",
      "road, produced a gentle, monotonous noise. These things are charming\n",
      "when one is joyous, and lugubrious when one is sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was broad daylight when he arrived at Hesdin. He halted in front of\n",
      "the inn, to allow the horse a breathing spell, and to have him given\n",
      "some oats.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horse belonged, as Scaufflaire had said, to that small race of the\n",
      "Boulonnais, which has too much head, too much belly, and not enough\n",
      "neck and shoulders, but which has a broad chest, a large crupper, thin,\n",
      "fine legs, and solid hoofs—a homely, but a robust and healthy race. The\n",
      "excellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours, and had not a\n",
      "drop of sweat on his loins.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not get out of the tilbury. The stableman who brought the oats\n",
      "suddenly bent down and examined the left wheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you going far in this condition?” said the man.\n",
      "\n",

      "fixed on the wheel; then he rose erect and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because, though this wheel has travelled five leagues, it certainly\n",
      "will not travel another quarter of a league.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He sprang out of the tilbury.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that you say, my friend?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagues\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The wheel really had suffered serious damage. The shock administered by\n",

      "He had not yielded to this sort of first summons; he had just made\n",
      "every possible effort to continue the journey; he had loyally and\n",
      "scrupulously exhausted all means; he had been deterred neither by the\n",
      "season, nor fatigue, nor by the expense; he had nothing with which to\n",
      "reproach himself. If he went no further, that was no fault of his. It\n",

      "act of his own conscience, but the act of Providence.\n",
      "\n",
      "He breathed again. He breathed freely and to the full extent of his\n",
      "lungs for the first time since Javert’s visit. It seemed to him that\n",
      "the hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last\n",
      "twenty hours had just released him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to him that God was for him now, and was manifesting Himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said to himself that he had done all he could, and that now he had\n",
      "nothing to do but retrace his steps quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "If his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber\n",

      "him, things would have rested there, and it is probable that we should\n",
      "not have had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about\n",
      "to peruse; but this conversation had taken place in the street. Any\n",
      "colloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd. There are always\n",
      "people who ask nothing better than to become spectators. While he was\n",
      "questioning the wheelwright, some people who were passing back and\n",
      "forth halted around them. After listening for a few minutes, a young\n",
      "lad, to whom no one had paid any heed, detached himself from the group\n",
      "and ran off.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment when the traveller, after the inward deliberation which\n",

      "\n",
      "“Monsieur,” said the woman, “my boy tells me that you wish to hire a\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the\n",
      "perspiration trickle down his limbs. He thought that he beheld the hand\n",
      "which had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him, ready\n",
      "to seize him once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, my good woman; I am in search of a cabriolet which I can hire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he hastened to add:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“But there is none in the place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly there is,” said the old woman.\n",

      "“Where?” interpolated the wheelwright.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At my house,” replied the old woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shuddered. The fatal hand had grasped him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring-cart. The\n",
      "wheelwright and the stable-man, in despair at the prospect of the\n",
      "traveller escaping their clutches, interfered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a frightful old trap; it rests flat on the axle; it is an\n",
      "actual fact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs;\n",
      "the rain came into it; the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture;\n",
      "it would not go much further than the tilbury; a regular ramshackle old\n",
      "stage-wagon; the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted\n",
      "himself to it,” etc., etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this was true; but this trap, this ramshackle old vehicle, this\n",
      "thing, whatever it was, ran on its two wheels and could go to Arras.\n",
      "\n",
      "He paid what was asked, left the tilbury with the wheelwright to be\n",
      "repaired, intending to reclaim it on his return, had the white horse\n",
      "put to the cart, climbed into it, and resumed the road which he had\n",
      "been travelling since morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment when the cart moved off, he admitted that he had felt, a\n",
      "moment previously, a certain joy in the thought that he should not go\n",
      "whither he was now proceeding. He examined this joy with a sort of\n",
      "wrath, and found it absurd. Why should he feel joy at turning back?\n",
      "After all, he was taking this trip of his own free will. No one was\n",
      "forcing him to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he left Hesdin, he heard a voice shouting to him: “Stop! Stop!” He\n",
      "halted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish and\n",
      "convulsive element resembling hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the old woman’s little boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur,” said the latter, “it was I who got the cart for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have not given me anything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He who gave to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almost\n",
      "odious.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! it’s you, you scamp?” said he; “you shall have nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He whipped up his horse and set off at full speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had lost a great deal of time at Hesdin. He wanted to make it good.\n",
      "The little horse was courageous, and pulled for two; but it was the\n",
      "month of February, there had been rain; the roads were bad. And then,\n",
      "it was no longer the tilbury. The cart was very heavy, and in addition,\n",
      "there were many ascents.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took nearly four hours to go from Hesdin to Saint-Pol; four hours\n",
      "for five leagues.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Saint-Pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came to\n",
      "and led to the stable; as he had promised Scaufflaire, he stood beside\n",
      "the manger while the horse was eating; he thought of sad and confusing\n",
      "things.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inn-keeper’s wife came to the stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does not Monsieur wish to breakfast?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, that is true; I even have a good appetite.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He followed the woman, who had a rosy, cheerful face; she led him to\n",
      "the public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Make haste!” said he; “I must start again; I am in a hurry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A big Flemish servant-maid placed his knife and fork in all haste; he\n",
      "looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is what ailed me,” he thought; “I had not breakfasted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "His breakfast was served; he seized the bread, took a mouthful, and\n",
      "then slowly replaced it on the table, and did not touch it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "A carter was eating at another table; he said to this man:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why is their bread so bitter here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The carter was a German and did not understand him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He returned to the stable and remained near the horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "An hour later he had quitted Saint-Pol and was directing his course\n",
      "towards Tinques, which is only five leagues from Arras.\n",
      "\n",
      "What did he do during this journey? Of what was he thinking? As in the\n",
      "morning, he watched the trees, the thatched roofs, the tilled fields\n",
      "pass by, and the way in which the landscape, broken at every turn of\n",
      "the road, vanished; this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes\n",
      "suffices to the soul, and almost relieves it from thought. What is more\n",
      "melancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for the\n",
      "first and the last time? To travel is to be born and to die at every\n",
      "instant; perhaps, in the vaguest region of his mind, he did make\n",
      "comparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence: all\n",
      "the things of life are perpetually fleeing before us; the dark and\n",
      "bright intervals are intermingled; after a dazzling moment, an eclipse;\n",
      "we look, we hasten, we stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing;\n",
      "each event is a turn in the road, and, all at once, we are old; we feel\n",
      "a shock; all is black; we distinguish an obscure door; the gloomy horse\n",
      "of life, which has been drawing us halts, and we see a veiled and\n",
      "unknown person unharnessing amid the shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school\n",
      "beheld this traveller enter Tinques; it is true that the days were\n",
      "still short; he did not halt at Tinques; as he emerged from the\n",
      "village, a laborer, who was mending the road with stones, raised his\n",
      "head and said to him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“That horse is very much fatigued.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor beast was, in fact, going at a walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you going to Arras?” added the road-mender.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped his horse, and asked the laborer:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“How far is it from here to Arras?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nearly seven good leagues.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“How is that? the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” returned the road-mender, “so you don’t know that the road is\n",
      "under repair? You will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on;\n",
      "there is no way to proceed further.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will take the road on the left, leading to Carency; you will cross\n",
      "the river; when you reach Camblin, you will turn to the right; that is\n",
      "the road to Mont-Saint-Éloy which leads to Arras.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is night, and I shall lose my way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You do not belong in these parts?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And, besides, it is all crossroads; stop! sir,” resumed the\n",
      "road-mender; “shall I give you a piece of advice? your horse is tired;\n",

      "“I must be there this evening.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is different; but go to the inn all the same, and get an extra\n",
      "horse; the stable-boy will guide you through the crossroads.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He followed the road-mender’s advice, retraced his steps, and, half an\n",
      "hour later, he passed the same spot again, but this time at full speed,\n",
      "with a good horse to aid; a stable-boy, who called himself a postilion,\n",
      "was seated on the shaft of the cariole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, he felt that he had lost time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Night had fully come.\n",
      "\n",
      "They turned into the crossroad; the way became frightfully bad; the\n",
      "cart lurched from one rut to the other; he said to the postilion:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep at a trot, and you shall have a double fee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In one of the jolts, the whiffle-tree broke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s the whiffle-tree broken, sir,” said the postilion; “I don’t\n",
      "know how to harness my horse now; this road is very bad at night; if\n",
      "you wish to return and sleep at Tinques, we could be in Arras early\n",
      "to-morrow morning.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“The stableman says that Monsieur’s horse is extremely fatigued.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here he broke his silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will not the horse be in a condition to set out again to-morrow\n",
      "morning?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Monsieur! he must rest for two days at least.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He inquired:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is not the posting-station located here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hostess conducted him to the office; he showed his passport, and\n",
      "inquired whether there was any way of returning that same night to M.\n",
      "sur M. by the mail-wagon; the seat beside the post-boy chanced to be\n",
      "vacant; he engaged it and paid for it. “Monsieur,” said the clerk, “do\n",
      "not fail to be here ready to start at precisely one o’clock in the\n",
      "morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This done, he left the hotel and began to wander about the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not acquainted with Arras; the streets were dark, and he walked\n",
      "on at random; but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of the\n",
      "passers-by. He crossed the little river Crinchon, and found himself in\n",
      "a labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way. A citizen was\n",
      "passing along with a lantern. After some hesitation, he decided to\n",
      "apply to this man, not without having first glanced behind and in front\n",
      "of him, as though he feared lest some one should hear the question\n",
      "which he was about to put.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur,” said he, “where is the court-house, if you please.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You do not belong in town, sir?” replied the bourgeois, who was an\n",
      "oldish man; “well, follow me. I happen to be going in the direction of\n",
      "the court-house, that is to say, in the direction of the hotel of the\n",
      "prefecture; for the court-house is undergoing repairs just at this\n",
      "moment, and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the\n",
      "prefecture.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it there that the Assizes are held?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly, sir; you see, the prefecture of to-day was the bishop’s\n",
      "palace before the Revolution. M. de Conzié, who was bishop in ’82,\n",
      "built a grand hall there. It is in this grand hall that the court is\n",
      "held.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the way, the bourgeois said to him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“If Monsieur desires to witness a case, it is rather late. The sittings\n",
      "generally close at six o’clock.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When they arrived on the grand square, however, the man pointed out to\n",
      "him four long windows all lighted up, in the front of a vast and gloomy\n",
      "building.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word, sir, you are in luck; you have arrived in season. Do you\n",
      "see those four windows? That is the Court of Assizes. There is light\n",
      "there, so they are not through. The matter must have been greatly\n",
      "protracted, and they are holding an evening session. Do you take an\n",
      "interest in this affair? Is it a criminal case? Are you a witness?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He replied:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not come on any business; I only wish to speak to one of the\n",
      "lawyers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is different,” said the bourgeois. “Stop, sir; here is the door\n",
      "where the sentry stands. You have only to ascend the grand staircase.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He conformed to the bourgeois’s directions, and a few minutes later he\n",
      "was in a hall containing many people, and where groups, intermingled\n",
      "with lawyers in their gowns, were whispering together here and there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is always a heart-breaking thing to see these congregations of men\n",
      "robed in black, murmuring together in low voices, on the threshold of\n",
      "the halls of justice. It is rare that charity and pity are the outcome\n",
      "of these words. Condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely to\n",
      "be the result. All these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful\n",
      "observer so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in\n",
      "concert all sorts of dark edifices.\n",
      "\n",
      "This spacious hall, illuminated by a single lamp, was the old hall of\n",
      "the episcopal palace, and served as the large hall of the palace of\n",
      "justice. A double-leaved door, which was closed at that moment,\n",
      "separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer\n",
      "whom he met.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What stage have they reached, sir?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is finished,” said the lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Finished!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me sir; perhaps you are a relative?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; I know no one here. Has judgment been pronounced?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course. Nothing else was possible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“To penal servitude?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“For life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He continued, in a voice so weak that it was barely audible:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then his identity was established?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What identity?” replied the lawyer. “There was no identity to be\n",
      "established. The matter was very simple. The woman had murdered her\n",
      "child; the infanticide was proved; the jury threw out the question of\n",
      "premeditation, and she was condemned for life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“So it was a woman?” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, certainly. The Limosin woman. Of what are you speaking?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing. But since it is all over, how comes it that the hall is still\n",
      "lighted?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“For another case, which was begun about two hours ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What other case?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! this one is a clear case also. It is about a sort of blackguard; a\n",
      "man arrested for a second offence; a convict who has been guilty of\n",
      "theft. I don’t know his name exactly. There’s a bandit’s phiz for you!\n",
      "I’d send him to the galleys on the strength of his face alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there any way of getting into the court-room, sir?” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I really think that there is not. There is a great crowd. However, the\n",
      "hearing has been suspended. Some people have gone out, and when the\n",
      "hearing is resumed, you might make an effort.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is the entrance?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Through yonder large door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer left him. In the course of a few moments he had experienced,\n",
      "almost simultaneously, almost intermingled with each other, all\n",
      "possible emotions. The words of this indifferent spectator had, in\n",
      "turn, pierced his heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire.\n",
      "When he saw that nothing was settled, he breathed freely once more; but\n",
      "he could not have told whether what he felt was pain or pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying. The\n",
      "docket of the session was very heavy; the president had appointed for\n",
      "the same day two short and simple cases. They had begun with the\n",
      "infanticide, and now they had reached the convict, the old offender,\n",
      "the “return horse.” This man had stolen apples, but that did not appear\n",
      "to be entirely proved; what had been proved was, that he had already\n",
      "been in the galleys at Toulon. It was that which lent a bad aspect to\n",
      "his case. However, the man’s examination and the depositions of the\n",
      "witnesses had been completed, but the lawyer’s plea, and the speech of\n",
      "the public prosecutor were still to come; it could not be finished\n",
      "before midnight. The man would probably be condemned; the\n",
      "attorney-general was very clever, and never _missed_ his culprits; he\n",
      "was a brilliant fellow who wrote verses.\n",
      "\n",
      "An usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the Assizes.\n",
      "He inquired of this usher:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will the door be opened soon, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will not be opened at all,” replied the usher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed? Is not the\n",
      "hearing suspended?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The hearing has just been begun again,” replied the usher, “but the\n",
      "door will not be opened again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because the hall is full.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! There is not room for one more?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not another one. The door is closed. No one can enter now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The usher added after a pause: “There are, to tell the truth, two or\n",
      "three extra places behind Monsieur le Président, but Monsieur le\n",
      "Président only admits public functionaries to them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, the usher turned his back.\n",
      "\n",
      "He retired with bowed head, traversed the antechamber, and slowly\n",
      "descended the stairs, as though hesitating at every step. It is\n",
      "probable that he was holding counsel with himself. The violent conflict\n",
      "which had been going on within him since the preceding evening was not\n",
      "yet ended; and every moment he encountered some new phase of it. On\n",
      "reaching the landing-place, he leaned his back against the balusters\n",
      "and folded his arms. All at once he opened his coat, drew out his\n",
      "pocket-book, took from it a pencil, tore out a leaf, and upon that leaf\n",
      "he wrote rapidly, by the light of the street lantern, this line: _M.\n",
      "Madeleine, Mayor of M. sur M._; then he ascended the stairs once more\n",
      "with great strides, made his way through the crowd, walked straight up\n",
      "to the usher, handed him the paper, and said in an authoritative\n",
      "manner:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take this to Monsieur le Président.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The usher took the paper, cast a glance upon it, and obeyed.\n",

      "CHAPTER VIII—AN ENTRANCE BY FAVOR\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although he did not suspect the fact, the mayor of M. sur M. enjoyed a\n",
      "sort of celebrity. For the space of seven years his reputation for\n",
      "virtue had filled the whole of Bas Boulonnais; it had eventually passed\n",
      "the confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through two\n",
      "or three neighboring departments. Besides the service which he had\n",
      "rendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry,\n",
      "there was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of the\n",
      "arrondissement of M. sur M. which was not indebted to him for some\n",
      "benefit. He had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the\n",
      "industries of other arrondissements. It was thus that he had, when\n",
      "occasion offered, supported with his credit and his funds the linen\n",
      "factory at Boulogne, the flax-spinning industry at Frévent, and the\n",
      "hydraulic manufacture of cloth at Boubers-sur-Canche. Everywhere the\n",
      "name of M. Madeleine was pronounced with veneration. Arras and Douai\n",
      "envied the happy little town of M. sur M. its mayor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Councillor of the Royal Court of Douai, who was presiding over this\n",
      "session of the Assizes at Arras, was acquainted, in common with the\n",
      "rest of the world, with this name which was so profoundly and\n",
      "universally honored. When the usher, discreetly opening the door which\n",
      "connected the council-chamber with the court-room, bent over the back\n",
      "of the President’s armchair and handed him the paper on which was\n",
      "inscribed the line which we have just perused, adding: “The gentleman\n",
      "desires to be present at the trial,” the President, with a quick and\n",
      "deferential movement, seized a pen and wrote a few words at the bottom\n",
      "of the paper and returned it to the usher, saying, “Admit him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the\n",
      "door of the hall, in the same place and the same attitude in which the\n",
      "usher had left him. In the midst of his reverie he heard some one\n",
      "saying to him, “Will Monsieur do me the honor to follow me?” It was the\n",
      "same usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously,\n",
      "and who was now bowing to the earth before him. At the same time, the\n",
      "usher handed him the paper. He unfolded it, and as he chanced to be\n",
      "near the light, he could read it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The President of the Court of Assizes presents his respects to M.\n",
      "Madeleine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained for\n",
      "him a strange and bitter aftertaste.\n",
      "\n",
      "He followed the usher.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscoted\n",
      "cabinet of severe aspect, lighted by two wax candles, placed upon a\n",
      "table with a green cloth. The last words of the usher who had just\n",
      "quitted him still rang in his ears: “Monsieur, you are now in the\n",
      "council-chamber; you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder\n",
      "door, and you will find yourself in the court-room, behind the\n",
      "President’s chair.” These words were mingled in his thoughts with a\n",
      "vague memory of narrow corridors and dark staircases which he had\n",
      "recently traversed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The usher had left him alone. The supreme moment had arrived. He sought\n",
      "to collect his faculties, but could not. It is chiefly at the moment\n",
      "when there is the greatest need for attaching them to the painful\n",
      "realities of life, that the threads of thought snap within the brain.\n",
      "He was in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned.\n",
      "With stupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible\n",
      "apartment, where so many lives had been broken, which was soon to ring\n",
      "with his name, and which his fate was at that moment traversing. He\n",
      "stared at the wall, then he looked at himself, wondering that it should\n",
      "be that chamber and that it should be he.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours; he was worn out by the\n",
      "jolts of the cart, but he was not conscious of it. It seemed to him\n",
      "that he felt nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall, and which\n",
      "contained, under glass, an ancient autograph letter of Jean Nicolas\n",
      "Pache, mayor of Paris and minister, and dated, through an error, no\n",
      "doubt, the _9th of June_, of the year II., and in which Pache forwarded\n",
      "to the commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by\n",
      "them. Any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment, and who\n",
      "had watched him, would have imagined, doubtless, that this letter\n",
      "struck him as very curious, for he did not take his eyes from it, and\n",
      "he read it two or three times. He read it without paying any attention\n",
      "to it, and unconsciously. He was thinking of Fantine and Cosette.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he dreamed, he turned round, and his eyes fell upon the brass knob\n",
      "of the door which separated him from the Court of Assizes. He had\n",
      "almost forgotten that door. His glance, calm at first, paused there,\n",
      "remained fixed on that brass handle, then grew terrified, and little by\n",
      "little became impregnated with fear. Beads of perspiration burst forth\n",
      "among his hair and trickled down upon his temples.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort of\n",
      "authority mingled with rebellion, which is intended to convey, and\n",
      "which does so well convey, _“Pardieu! who compels me to this?”_ Then he\n",
      "wheeled briskly round, caught sight of the door through which he had\n",
      "entered in front of him, went to it, opened it, and passed out. He was\n",
      "no longer in that chamber; he was outside in a corridor, a long, narrow\n",
      "corridor, broken by steps and gratings, making all sorts of angles,\n",
      "lighted here and there by lanterns similar to the night taper of\n",
      "invalids, the corridor through which he had approached. He breathed, he\n",
      "listened; not a sound in front, not a sound behind him, and he fled as\n",
      "though pursued.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had turned many angles in this corridor, he still listened. The\n",
      "same silence reigned, and there was the same darkness around him. He\n",
      "was out of breath; he staggered; he leaned against the wall. The stone\n",
      "was cold; the perspiration lay ice-cold on his brow; he straightened\n",
      "himself up with a shiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, there alone in the darkness, trembling with cold and with\n",
      "something else, too, perchance, he meditated.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had meditated all night long; he had meditated all the day: he heard\n",
      "within him but one voice, which said, “Alas!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A quarter of an hour passed thus. At length he bowed his head, sighed\n",
      "with agony, dropped his arms, and retraced his steps. He walked slowly,\n",
      "and as though crushed. It seemed as though some one had overtaken him\n",
      "in his flight and was leading him back.\n",
      "\n",
      "He re-entered the council-chamber. The first thing he caught sight of\n",
      "was the knob of the door. This knob, which was round and of polished\n",
      "brass, shone like a terrible star for him. He gazed at it as a lamb\n",
      "might gaze into the eye of a tiger.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not take his eyes from it. From time to time he advanced a\n",
      "step and approached the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had he listened, he would have heard the sound of the adjoining hall\n",
      "like a sort of confused murmur; but he did not listen, and he did not\n",
      "hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, without himself knowing how it happened, he found himself\n",
      "near the door; he grasped the knob convulsively; the door opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was in the court-room.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He advanced a pace, closed the door mechanically behind him, and\n",
      "remained standing, contemplating what he saw.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a vast and badly lighted apartment, now full of uproar, now full\n",
      "of silence, where all the apparatus of a criminal case, with its petty\n",
      "and mournful gravity in the midst of the throng, was in process of\n",
      "development.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the one end of the hall, the one where he was, were judges, with\n",
      "abstracted air, in threadbare robes, who were gnawing their nails or\n",
      "closing their eyelids; at the other end, a ragged crowd; lawyers in all\n",
      "sorts of attitudes; soldiers with hard but honest faces; ancient,\n",
      "spotted woodwork, a dirty ceiling, tables covered with serge that was\n",
      "yellow rather than green; doors blackened by handmarks; tap-room lamps\n",
      "which emitted more smoke than light, suspended from nails in the\n",
      "wainscot; on the tables candles in brass candlesticks; darkness,\n",
      "ugliness, sadness; and from all this there was disengaged an austere\n",

      "\n",
      "No one in all that throng paid any attention to him; all glances were\n",

      "and like a stranger in the midst of this society which was seizing fast\n",
      "upon him; nevertheless, it was a question of the most menacing future\n",
      "for him; the likeness increased every moment, and the entire crowd\n",
      "surveyed, with more anxiety than he did himself, that sentence\n",
      "freighted with calamity, which descended ever closer over his head;\n",
      "there was even a glimpse of a possibility afforded; besides the\n",

      "The counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well, in that\n",

      "at Romorantin or at Montbrison, and which to-day, having become\n",
      "classic, is no longer spoken except by the official orators of\n",
      "magistracy, to whom it is suited on account of its grave sonorousness\n",
      "and its majestic stride; a tongue in which a husband is called _a\n",

      "civilization_; the king, _the monarch_; Monseigneur the Bishop, _a\n",

      "seminary, _these tender levities_; errors imputed to newspapers, _the\n",
      "imposture which distills its venom through the columns of those\n",
      "organs_; etc. The lawyer had, accordingly, begun with an explanation as\n",
      "to the theft of the apples,—an awkward matter couched in fine style;\n",
      "but Bénigne Bossuet himself was obliged to allude to a chicken in the\n",
      "midst of a funeral oration, and he extricated himself from the\n",
      "situation in stately fashion. The lawyer established the fact that the\n",
      "theft of the apples had not been circumstantially proved. His client,\n",
      "whom he, in his character of counsel, persisted in calling\n",
      "Champmathieu, had not been seen scaling that wall nor breaking that\n",
      "branch by any one. He had been taken with that branch (which the lawyer\n",
      "preferred to call a _bough_) in his possession; but he said that he had\n",
      "found it broken off and lying on the ground, and had picked it up.\n",
      "Where was there any proof to the contrary? No doubt that branch had\n",
      "been broken off and concealed after the scaling of the wall, then\n",
      "thrown away by the alarmed marauder; there was no doubt that there had\n",
      "been a thief in the case. But what proof was there that that thief had\n",
      "been Champmathieu? One thing only. His character as an ex-convict. The\n",
      "lawyer did not deny that that character appeared to be, unhappily, well\n",
      "attested; the accused had resided at Faverolles; the accused had\n",
      "exercised the calling of a tree-pruner there; the name of Champmathieu\n",
      "might well have had its origin in Jean Mathieu; all that was true,—in\n",
      "short, four witnesses recognize Champmathieu, positively and without\n",
      "hesitation, as that convict, Jean Valjean; to these signs, to this\n",
      "testimony, the counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of his\n",
      "client, the denial of an interested party; but supposing that he was\n",
      "the convict Jean Valjean, did that prove that he was the thief of the\n",
      "apples? that was a presumption at the most, not a proof. The prisoner,\n",
      "it was true, and his counsel, “in good faith,” was obliged to admit it,\n",
      "had adopted “a bad system of defence.” He obstinately denied\n",
      "everything, the theft and his character of convict. An admission upon\n",
      "this last point would certainly have been better, and would have won\n",
      "for him the indulgence of his judges; the counsel had advised him to do\n",
      "this; but the accused had obstinately refused, thinking, no doubt, that\n",
      "he would save everything by admitting nothing. It was an error; but\n",
      "ought not the paucity of this intelligence to be taken into\n",
      "consideration? This man was visibly stupid. Long-continued wretchedness\n",
      "in the galleys, long misery outside the galleys, had brutalized him,\n",
      "etc. He defended himself badly; was that a reason for condemning him?\n",
      "As for the affair with Little Gervais, the counsel need not discuss it;\n",
      "it did not enter into the case. The lawyer wound up by beseeching the\n",
      "jury and the court, if the identity of Jean Valjean appeared to them to\n",
      "be evident, to apply to him the police penalties which are provided for\n",
      "a criminal who has broken his ban, and not the frightful chastisement\n",
      "which descends upon the convict guilty of a second offence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The district-attorney answered the counsel for the defence. He was\n",
      "violent and florid, as district-attorneys usually are.\n",
      "\n",
      "He congratulated the counsel for the defence on his “loyalty,” and\n",
      "skilfully took advantage of this loyalty. He reached the accused\n",
      "through all the concessions made by his lawyer. The advocate had seemed\n",
      "to admit that the prisoner was Jean Valjean. He took note of this. So\n",
      "this man was Jean Valjean. This point had been conceded to the\n",
      "accusation and could no longer be disputed. Here, by means of a clever\n",
      "autonomasia which went back to the sources and causes of crime, the\n",
      "district-attorney thundered against the immorality of the romantic\n",
      "school, then dawning under the name of _the Satanic school_, which had\n",
      "been bestowed upon it by the critics of the _Quotidienne_ and the\n",
      "_Oriflamme_; he attributed, not without some probability, to the\n",
      "influence of this perverse literature the crime of Champmathieu, or\n",
      "rather, to speak more correctly, of Jean Valjean. Having exhausted\n",
      "these considerations, he passed on to Jean Valjean himself. Who was\n",
      "this Jean Valjean? Description of Jean Valjean: a monster spewed forth,\n",
      "etc. The model for this sort of description is contained in the tale of\n",
      "Théramène, which is not useful to tragedy, but which every day renders\n",
      "great services to judicial eloquence. The audience and the jury\n",
      "“shuddered.” The description finished, the district-attorney resumed\n",
      "with an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the\n",
      "journal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day:\n",
      "And it is such a man, etc., etc., etc., vagabond, beggar, without means\n",
      "of existence, etc., etc., inured by his past life to culpable deeds,\n",
      "and but little reformed by his sojourn in the galleys, as was proved by\n",
      "the crime committed against Little Gervais, etc., etc.; it is such a\n",
      "man, caught upon the highway in the very act of theft, a few paces from\n",
      "a wall that had been scaled, still holding in his hand the object\n",
      "stolen, who denies the crime, the theft, the climbing the wall; denies\n",
      "everything; denies even his own identity! In addition to a hundred\n",
      "other proofs, to which we will not recur, four witnesses recognize\n",
      "him—Javert, the upright inspector of police; Javert, and three of his\n",
      "former companions in infamy, the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu, and\n",
      "Cochepaille. What does he offer in opposition to this overwhelming\n",
      "unanimity? His denial. What obduracy! You will do justice, gentlemen of\n",
      "the jury, etc., etc. While the district-attorney was speaking, the\n",
      "accused listened to him open-mouthed, with a sort of amazement in which\n",
      "some admiration was assuredly blended. He was evidently surprised that\n",
      "a man could talk like that. From time to time, at those “energetic”\n",
      "moments of the prosecutor’s speech, when eloquence which cannot contain\n",
      "itself overflows in a flood of withering epithets and envelops the\n",
      "accused like a storm, he moved his head slowly from right to left and\n",
      "from left to right in the sort of mute and melancholy protest with\n",
      "which he had contented himself since the beginning of the argument. Two\n",
      "or three times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say in\n",
      "a low voice, “That is what comes of not having asked M. Baloup.” The\n",
      "district-attorney directed the attention of the jury to this stupid\n",
      "attitude, evidently deliberate, which denoted not imbecility, but\n",
      "craft, skill, a habit of deceiving justice, and which set forth in all\n",
      "its nakedness the “profound perversity” of this man. He ended by making\n",
      "his reserves on the affair of Little Gervais and demanding a severe\n",
      "sentence.\n",

      "\n",
      "“This is what I have to say. That I have been a wheelwright in Paris,\n",
      "and that it was with Monsieur Baloup. It is a hard trade. In the\n",
      "wheelwright’s trade one works always in the open air, in courtyards,\n",
      "under sheds when the masters are good, never in closed workshops,\n",
      "because space is required, you see. In winter one gets so cold that one\n",
      "beats one’s arms together to warm one’s self; but the masters don’t\n",
      "like it; they say it wastes time. Handling iron when there is ice\n",
      "between the paving-stones is hard work. That wears a man out quickly.\n",
      "One is old while he is still quite young in that trade. At forty a man\n",
      "is done for. I was fifty-three. I was in a bad state. And then, workmen\n",

      "an old bird, old beast! I was not earning more than thirty sous a day.\n",
      "They paid me as little as possible. The masters took advantage of my\n",
      "age—and then I had my daughter, who was a laundress at the river. She\n",
      "earned a little also. It sufficed for us two. She had trouble, also;\n",
      "all day long up to her waist in a tub, in rain, in snow. When the wind\n",
      "cuts your face, when it freezes, it is all the same; you must still\n",
      "wash. There are people who have not much linen, and wait until late; if\n",
      "you do not wash, you lose your custom. The planks are badly joined, and\n",
      "water drops on you from everywhere; you have your petticoats all damp\n",
      "above and below. That penetrates. She has also worked at the laundry of\n",
      "the Enfants-Rouges, where the water comes through faucets. You are not\n",
      "in the tub there; you wash at the faucet in front of you, and rinse in\n",
      "a basin behind you. As it is enclosed, you are not so cold; but there\n",
      "is that hot steam, which is terrible, and which ruins your eyes. She\n",
      "came home at seven o’clock in the evening, and went to bed at once, she\n",
      "was so tired. Her husband beat her. She is dead. We have not been very\n",

      "very peaceable. I remember one Shrove-Tuesday when she went to bed at\n",
      "eight o’clock. There, I am telling the truth; you have only to ask. Ah,\n",

      "The prisoner had finally resumed his seat; he arose abruptly when the\n",
      "district-attorney had finished, and exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are very wicked; that you are! This what I wanted to say; I could\n",
      "not find words for it at first. I have stolen nothing. I am a man who\n",
      "does not have something to eat every day. I was coming from Ailly; I\n",
      "was walking through the country after a shower, which had made the\n",
      "whole country yellow: even the ponds were overflowed, and nothing\n",
      "sprang from the sand any more but the little blades of grass at the\n",
      "wayside. I found a broken branch with apples on the ground; I picked up\n",
      "the branch without knowing that it would get me into trouble. I have\n",
      "been in prison, and they have been dragging me about for the last three\n",
      "months; more than that I cannot say; people talk against me, they tell\n",
      "me, ‘Answer!’ The gendarme, who is a good fellow, nudges my elbow, and\n",
      "says to me in a low voice, ‘Come, answer!’ I don’t know how to explain;\n",
      "I have no education; I am a poor man; that is where they wrong me,\n",
      "because they do not see this. I have not stolen; I picked up from the\n",
      "ground things that were lying there. You say, Jean Valjean, Jean\n",
      "Mathieu! I don’t know those persons; they are villagers. I worked for\n",
      "M. Baloup, Boulevard de l’Hôpital; my name is Champmathieu. You are\n",
      "very clever to tell me where I was born; I don’t know myself: it’s not\n",
      "everybody who has a house in which to come into the world; that would\n",
      "be too convenient. I think that my father and mother were people who\n",
      "strolled along the highways; I know nothing different. When I was a\n",
      "child, they called me _young fellow_; now they call me _old Fellow_;\n",
      "those are my baptismal names; take that as you like. I have been in\n",
      "Auvergne; I have been at Faverolles. Pardi. Well! can’t a man have been\n",
      "in Auvergne, or at Faverolles, without having been in the galleys? I\n",
      "tell you that I have not stolen, and that I am Father Champmathieu; I\n",
      "have been with M. Baloup; I have had a settled residence. You worry me\n",
      "with your nonsense, there! Why is everybody pursuing me so furiously?”\n",

      "The district-attorney had remained standing; he addressed the\n",
      "President:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur le Président, in view of the confused but exceedingly clever\n",
      "denials of the prisoner, who would like to pass himself off as an\n",
      "idiot, but who will not succeed in so doing,—we shall attend to\n",
      "that,—we demand that it shall please you and that it shall please the\n",
      "court to summon once more into this place the convicts Brevet,\n",
      "Cochepaille, and Chenildieu, and Police-Inspector Javert, and question\n",
      "them for the last time as to the identity of the prisoner with the\n",
      "convict Jean Valjean.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would remind the district-attorney,” said the President, “that\n",
      "Police-Inspector Javert, recalled by his duties to the capital of a\n",
      "neighboring arrondissement, left the court-room and the town as soon as\n",
      "he had made his deposition; we have accorded him permission, with the\n",
      "consent of the district-attorney and of the counsel for the prisoner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true, Mr. President,” responded the district-attorney. “In the\n",
      "absence of sieur Javert, I think it my duty to remind the gentlemen of\n",
      "the jury of what he said here a few hours ago. Javert is an estimable\n",
      "man, who does honor by his rigorous and strict probity to inferior but\n",
      "important functions. These are the terms of his deposition: ‘I do not\n",
      "even stand in need of circumstantial proofs and moral presumptions to\n",
      "give the lie to the prisoner’s denial. I recognize him perfectly. The\n",
      "name of this man is not Champmathieu; he is an ex-convict named Jean\n",
      "Valjean, and is very vicious and much to be feared. It is only with\n",
      "extreme regret that he was released at the expiration of his term. He\n",
      "underwent nineteen years of penal servitude for theft. He made five or\n",
      "six attempts to escape. Besides the theft from Little Gervais, and from\n",
      "the Pierron orchard, I suspect him of a theft committed in the house of\n",
      "His Grace the late Bishop of D—— I often saw him at the time when I was\n",
      "adjutant of the galley-guard at the prison in Toulon. I repeat that I\n",
      "recognize him perfectly.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This extremely precise statement appeared to produce a vivid impression\n",
      "on the public and on the jury. The district-attorney concluded by\n",
      "insisting, that in default of Javert, the three witnesses Brevet,\n",
      "Chenildieu, and Cochepaille should be heard once more and solemnly\n",
      "interrogated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President transmitted the order to an usher, and, a moment later,\n",
      "the door of the witnesses’ room opened. The usher, accompanied by a\n",
      "gendarme ready to lend him armed assistance, introduced the convict\n",
      "Brevet. The audience was in suspense; and all breasts heaved as though\n",
      "they had contained but one soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ex-convict Brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the central\n",
      "prisons. Brevet was a person sixty years of age, who had a sort of\n",
      "business man’s face, and the air of a rascal. The two sometimes go\n",
      "together. In prison, whither fresh misdeeds had led him, he had become\n",
      "something in the nature of a turnkey. He was a man of whom his\n",
      "superiors said, “He tries to make himself of use.” The chaplains bore\n",
      "good testimony as to his religious habits. It must not be forgotten\n",
      "that this passed under the Restoration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Brevet,” said the President, “you have undergone an ignominious\n",
      "sentence, and you cannot take an oath.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Brevet dropped his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nevertheless,” continued the President, “even in the man whom the law\n",
      "has degraded, there may remain, when the divine mercy permits it, a\n",
      "sentiment of honor and of equity. It is to this sentiment that I appeal\n",
      "at this decisive hour. If it still exists in you,—and I hope it\n",
      "does,—reflect before replying to me: consider on the one hand, this\n",
      "man, whom a word from you may ruin; on the other hand, justice, which a\n",
      "word from you may enlighten. The instant is solemn; there is still time\n",
      "to retract if you think you have been mistaken. Rise, prisoner. Brevet,\n",
      "take a good look at the accused, recall your souvenirs, and tell us on\n",
      "your soul and conscience, if you persist in recognizing this man as\n",
      "your former companion in the galleys, Jean Valjean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Brevet looked at the prisoner, then turned towards the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Mr. President, I was the first to recognize him, and I stick to\n",
      "it; that man is Jean Valjean, who entered at Toulon in 1796, and left\n",
      "in 1815. I left a year later. He has the air of a brute now; but it\n",
      "must be because age has brutalized him; he was sly at the galleys: I\n",
      "recognize him positively.”\n",

      "\n",

      "Chenildieu was brought in, a prisoner for life, as was indicated by his\n",
      "red cassock and his green cap. He was serving out his sentence at the\n",
      "galleys of Toulon, whence he had been brought for this case. He was a\n",
      "small man of about fifty, brisk, wrinkled, frail, yellow, brazen-faced,\n",
      "feverish, who had a sort of sickly feebleness about all his limbs and\n",
      "his whole person, and an immense force in his glance. His companions in\n",
      "the galleys had nicknamed him _I-deny-God_ (_Je-nie Dieu_, Chenildieu).\n",
      "\n",
      "The President addressed him in nearly the same words which he had used\n",
      "to Brevet. At the moment when he reminded him of his infamy which\n",
      "deprived him of the right to take an oath, Chenildieu raised his head\n",
      "and looked the crowd in the face. The President invited him to\n",
      "reflection, and asked him as he had asked Brevet, if he persisted in\n",
      "recognition of the prisoner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chenildieu burst out laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardieu, as if I didn’t recognize him! We were attached to the same\n",
      "chain for five years. So you are sulking, old fellow?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go take your seat,” said the President.\n",
      "\n",
      "The usher brought in Cochepaille. He was another convict for life, who\n",
      "had come from the galleys, and was dressed in red, like Chenildieu, was\n",
      "a peasant from Lourdes, and a half-bear of the Pyrenees. He had guarded\n",
      "the flocks among the mountains, and from a shepherd he had slipped into\n",
      "a brigand. Cochepaille was no less savage and seemed even more stupid\n",
      "than the prisoner. He was one of those wretched men whom nature has\n",
      "sketched out for wild beasts, and on whom society puts the finishing\n",
      "touches as convicts in the galleys.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President tried to touch him with some grave and pathetic words,\n",
      "and asked him, as he had asked the other two, if he persisted, without\n",
      "hesitation or trouble, in recognizing the man who was standing before\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is Jean Valjean,” said Cochepaille. “He was even called\n",
      "Jean-the-Screw, because he was so strong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these affirmations from these three men, evidently sincere and\n",
      "in good faith, had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury for\n",
      "the prisoner,—a murmur which increased and lasted longer each time that\n",
      "a fresh declaration was added to the proceeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoner had listened to them, with that astounded face which was,\n",
      "according to the accusation, his principal means of defence; at the\n",
      "first, the gendarmes, his neighbors, had heard him mutter between his\n",
      "teeth: “Ah, well, he’s a nice one!” after the second, he said, a little\n",
      "louder, with an air that was almost that of satisfaction, “Good!” at\n",
      "the third, he cried, “Famous!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The President addressed him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you heard, prisoner? What have you to say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He replied:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say, ‘Famous!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "An uproar broke out among the audience, and was communicated to the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment there was a movement just beside the President; a voice\n",

      "“Brevet! Chenildieu! Cochepaille! look here!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All who heard that voice were chilled, so lamentable and terrible was\n",
      "it; all eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded. A man,\n",
      "placed among the privileged spectators who were seated behind the\n",
      "court, had just risen, had pushed open the half-door which separated\n",
      "the tribunal from the audience, and was standing in the middle of the\n",
      "hall; the President, the district-attorney, M. Bamatabois, twenty\n",
      "persons, recognized him, and exclaimed in concert:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“M. Madeleine!”\n",

      "CHAPTER XI—CHAMPMATHIEU MORE AND MORE ASTONISHED\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was he, in fact. The clerk’s lamp illumined his countenance. He held\n",
      "his hat in his hand; there was no disorder in his clothing; his coat\n",
      "was carefully buttoned; he was very pale, and he trembled slightly; his\n",
      "hair, which had still been gray on his arrival in Arras, was now\n",
      "entirely white: it had turned white during the hour he had sat there.\n",
      "\n",
      "All heads were raised: the sensation was indescribable; there was a\n",
      "momentary hesitation in the audience, the voice had been so\n",
      "heart-rending; the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did\n",
      "not understand at first. They asked themselves whether he had indeed\n",
      "uttered that cry; they could not believe that that tranquil man had\n",
      "been the one to give that terrible outcry.\n",
      "\n",
      "This indecision only lasted a few seconds. Even before the President\n",
      "and the district-attorney could utter a word, before the ushers and the\n",
      "gendarmes could make a gesture, the man whom all still called, at that\n",
      "moment, M. Madeleine, had advanced towards the witnesses Cochepaille,\n",
      "Brevet, and Chenildieu.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you not recognize me?” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "All three remained speechless, and indicated by a sign of the head that\n",
      "they did not know him. Cochepaille, who was intimidated, made a\n",
      "military salute. M. Madeleine turned towards the jury and the court,\n",
      "and said in a gentle voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gentlemen of the jury, order the prisoner to be released! Mr.\n",
      "President, have me arrested. He is not the man whom you are in search\n",
      "of; it is I: I am Jean Valjean.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a mouth breathed; the first commotion of astonishment had been\n",
      "followed by a silence like that of the grave; those within the hall\n",
      "experienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses when\n",
      "something grand has been done.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, the face of the President was stamped with sympathy\n",
      "and sadness; he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district-attorney\n",
      "and a few low-toned words with the assistant judges; he addressed the\n",
      "public, and asked in accents which all understood:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there a physician present?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The district-attorney took the word:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gentlemen of the jury, the very strange and unexpected incident which\n",
      "disturbs the audience inspires us, like yourselves, only with a\n",
      "sentiment which it is unnecessary for us to express. You all know, by\n",
      "reputation at least, the honorable M. Madeleine, mayor of M. sur M.; if\n",
      "there is a physician in the audience, we join the President in\n",
      "requesting him to attend to M. Madeleine, and to conduct him to his\n",
      "home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Madeleine did not allow the district-attorney to finish; he\n",
      "interrupted him in accents full of suavity and authority. These are the\n",
      "words which he uttered; here they are literally, as they were written\n",
      "down, immediately after the trial by one of the witnesses to this\n",
      "scene, and as they now ring in the ears of those who heard them nearly\n",
      "forty years ago:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thank you, Mr. District-Attorney, but I am not mad; you shall see;\n",
      "you were on the point of committing a great error; release this man! I\n",
      "am fulfilling a duty; I am that miserable criminal. I am the only one\n",
      "here who sees the matter clearly, and I am telling you the truth. God,\n",
      "who is on high, looks down on what I am doing at this moment, and that\n",
      "suffices. You can take me, for here I am: but I have done my best; I\n",
      "concealed myself under another name; I have become rich; I have become\n",
      "a mayor; I have tried to re-enter the ranks of the honest. It seems\n",
      "that that is not to be done. In short, there are many things which I\n",
      "cannot tell. I will not narrate the story of my life to you; you will\n",
      "hear it one of these days. I robbed Monseigneur the Bishop, it is true;\n",
      "it is true that I robbed Little Gervais; they were right in telling you\n",
      "that Jean Valjean was a very vicious wretch. Perhaps it was not\n",
      "altogether his fault. Listen, honorable judges! a man who has been so\n",
      "greatly humbled as I have has neither any remonstrances to make to\n",
      "Providence, nor any advice to give to society; but, you see, the infamy\n",
      "from which I have tried to escape is an injurious thing; the galleys\n",
      "make the convict what he is; reflect upon that, if you please. Before\n",
      "going to the galleys, I was a poor peasant, with very little\n",
      "intelligence, a sort of idiot; the galleys wrought a change in me. I\n",
      "was stupid; I became vicious: I was a block of wood; I became a\n",
      "firebrand. Later on, indulgence and kindness saved me, as severity had\n",
      "ruined me. But, pardon me, you cannot understand what I am saying. You\n",
      "will find at my house, among the ashes in the fireplace, the forty-sou\n",
      "piece which I stole, seven years ago, from Little Gervais. I have\n",
      "nothing farther to add; take me. Good God! the district-attorney shakes\n",
      "his head; you say, ‘M. Madeleine has gone mad!’ you do not believe me!\n",
      "that is distressing. Do not, at least, condemn this man! What! these\n",
      "men do not recognize me! I wish Javert were here; he would recognize\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing can reproduce the sombre and kindly melancholy of tone which\n",
      "accompanied these words.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned to the three convicts, and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I recognize you; do you remember, Brevet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, hesitated for an instant, and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you remember the knitted suspenders with a checked pattern which\n",
      "you wore in the galleys?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Brevet gave a start of surprise, and surveyed him from head to foot\n",
      "with a frightened air. He continued:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Chenildieu, you who conferred on yourself the name of ‘Jenie-Dieu,’\n",
      "your whole right shoulder bears a deep burn, because you one day laid\n",
      "your shoulder against the chafing-dish full of coals, in order to\n",
      "efface the three letters T. F. P., which are still visible,\n",
      "nevertheless; answer, is this true?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is true,” said Chenildieu.\n",
      "\n",
      "He addressed himself to Cochepaille:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cochepaille, you have, near the bend in your left arm, a date stamped\n",
      "in blue letters with burnt powder; the date is that of the landing of\n",
      "the Emperor at Cannes, March 1, 1815; pull up your sleeve!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cochepaille pushed up his sleeve; all eyes were focused on him and on\n",
      "his bare arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "A gendarme held a light close to it; there was the date.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unhappy man turned to the spectators and the judges with a smile\n",
      "which still rends the hearts of all who saw it whenever they think of\n",
      "it. It was a smile of triumph; it was also a smile of despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see plainly,” he said, “that I am Jean Valjean.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In that chamber there were no longer either judges, accusers, nor\n",
      "gendarmes; there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts.\n",
      "No one recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon to\n",
      "play; the district-attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of\n",
      "prosecuting, the President that he was there to preside, the counsel\n",
      "for the defence that he was there to defend. It was a striking\n",
      "circumstance that no question was put, that no authority intervened.\n",
      "The peculiarity of sublime spectacles is, that they capture all souls\n",
      "and turn witnesses into spectators. No one, probably, could have\n",
      "explained what he felt; no one, probably, said to himself that he was\n",
      "witnessing the splendid outburst of a grand light: all felt themselves\n",
      "inwardly dazzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was evident that they had Jean Valjean before their eyes. That was\n",
      "clear. The appearance of this man had sufficed to suffuse with light\n",
      "that matter which had been so obscure but a moment previously, without\n",
      "any further explanation: the whole crowd, as by a sort of electric\n",
      "revelation, understood instantly and at a single glance the simple and\n",
      "magnificent history of a man who was delivering himself up so that\n",
      "another man might not be condemned in his stead. The details, the\n",
      "hesitations, little possible oppositions, were swallowed up in that\n",
      "vast and luminous fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an impression which vanished speedily, but which was\n",
      "irresistible at the moment.\n",

      "to those maladies, and which breaks the hearts of mothers when they are\n",
      "watching through the night beside their sleeping child who is condemned\n",
      "to death. But this painful respiration hardly troubled a sort of\n",

      "indescribable unfolding of wings, all ready to open wide and bear her\n",
      "away, which could be felt as they rustled, though they could not be\n",
      "seen. To see her thus, one would never have dreamed that she was an\n",

      "happy. All night long I have seen white things, and persons who smiled\n",

      "stage-setting of mournful scenes. The child—a little girl—was going and\n",
      "coming, running to warm herself, laughing, singing at the top of her\n",

      "stairs with his habitual deliberation. Any one who was thoroughly\n",
      "acquainted with him, and who had examined him attentively at the\n",
      "moment, would have shuddered. The buckle of his leather stock was under\n",
      "his left ear instead of at the nape of his neck. This betrayed unwonted\n",
      "agitation.\n",

      "some slight degree, lost the scent, and of having indulged, for a few\n",
      "moments, in an error with regard to Champmathieu, was effaced by pride\n",
      "at having so well and accurately divined in the first place, and of\n",
      "having for so long cherished a just instinct. Javert’s content shone\n",
      "forth in his sovereign attitude. The deformity of triumph overspread\n",
      "that narrow brow. All the demonstrations of horror which a satisfied\n",
      "face can afford were there.\n",

      "Javert was in heaven at that moment. Without putting the thing clearly\n",
      "to himself, but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his\n",
      "presence and of his success, he, Javert, personified justice, light,\n",
      "and truth in their celestial function of crushing out evil. Behind him\n",
      "and around him, at an infinite distance, he had authority, reason, the\n",
      "case judged, the legal conscience, the public prosecution, all the\n",
      "stars; he was protecting order, he was causing the law to yield up its\n",
      "thunders, he was avenging society, he was lending a helping hand to the\n",
      "absolute, he was standing erect in the midst of a glory. There existed\n",
      "in his victory a remnant of defiance and of combat. Erect, haughty,\n",
      "brilliant, he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of\n",
      "a ferocious archangel. The terrible shadow of the action which he was\n",
      "accomplishing caused the vague flash of the social sword to be visible\n",
      "in his clenched fist; happy and indignant, he held his heel upon crime,\n",
      "vice, rebellion, perdition, hell; he was radiant, he exterminated, he\n",
      "smiled, and there was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous Saint\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fantine raised herself in bed with a bound, supporting herself on her\n",
      "stiffened arms and on both hands: she gazed at Jean Valjean, she gazed\n",
      "at Javert, she gazed at the nun, she opened her mouth as though to\n",
      "speak; a rattle proceeded from the depths of her throat, her teeth\n",
      "chattered; she stretched out her arms in her agony, opening her hands\n",
      "convulsively, and fumbling about her like a drowning person; then\n",
      "suddenly fell back on her pillow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her head struck the head-board of the bed and fell forwards on her\n",

      "march on instantly, or you’ll get the thumb-screws!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the corner of the room stood an old iron bedstead, which was in a\n",
      "decidedly decrepit state, and which served the sisters as a camp-bed\n",
      "when they were watching with the sick. Jean Valjean stepped up to this\n",
      "bed, in a twinkling wrenched off the head-piece, which was already in a\n",
      "dilapidated condition, an easy matter to muscles like his, grasped the\n",
      "principal rod like a bludgeon, and glanced at Javert. Javert retreated\n",
      "towards the door. Jean Valjean, armed with his bar of iron, walked\n",
      "slowly up to Fantine’s couch. When he arrived there he turned and said\n",
      "to Javert, in a voice that was barely audible:—\n",

      "\n",
      "It did occur to him to summon the guard, but Jean Valjean might avail\n",
      "himself of that moment to effect his escape; so he remained, grasped\n",
      "his cane by the small end, and leaned against the door-post, without\n",
      "removing his eyes from Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed, and\n",
      "his brow on his hand, and began to contemplate the motionless body of\n",
      "Fantine, which lay extended there. He remained thus, mute, absorbed,\n",
      "evidently with no further thought of anything connected with this life.\n",
      "Upon his face and in his attitude there was nothing but inexpressible\n",
      "pity. After a few moments of this meditation he bent towards Fantine,\n",
      "and spoke to her in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "What did he say to her? What could this man, who was reproved, say to\n",
      "that woman, who was dead? What words were those? No one on earth heard\n",
      "them. Did the dead woman hear them? There are some touching illusions\n",
      "which are, perhaps, sublime realities. The point as to which there\n",
      "exists no doubt is, that Sister Simplice, the sole witness of the\n",
      "incident, often said that at the moment that Jean Valjean whispered in\n",
      "Fantine’s ear, she distinctly beheld an ineffable smile dawn on those\n",
      "pale lips, and in those dim eyes, filled with the amazement of the\n",
      "tomb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean took Fantine’s head in both his hands, and arranged it on\n",
      "the pillow as a mother might have done for her child; then he tied the\n",
      "string of her chemise, and smoothed her hair back under her cap. That\n",
      "done, he closed her eyes.\n",

      "\n",
      "At that moment the small window in the lodge opened, a hand passed\n",
      "through, seized the key and the candlestick, and lighted the taper at\n",
      "the candle which was burning there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The portress raised her eyes, and stood there with gaping mouth, and a\n",
      "shriek which she confined to her throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew that hand, that arm, the sleeve of that coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was M. Madeleine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was several seconds before she could speak; she had a _seizure_, as\n",
      "she said herself, when she related the adventure afterwards.\n",

      "“Good God, Monsieur le Maire,” she cried at last, “I thought you were—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She stopped; the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking in\n",
      "respect towards the beginning. Jean Valjean was still Monsieur le Maire\n",
      "to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He finished her thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In prison,” said he. “I was there; I broke a bar of one of the\n",
      "windows; I let myself drop from the top of a roof, and here I am. I am\n",
      "going up to my room; go and find Sister Simplice for me. She is with\n",
      "that poor woman, no doubt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The old woman obeyed in all haste.\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave her no orders; he was quite sure that she would guard him\n",
      "better than he should guard himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard\n",
      "without opening the big gates. He had, and always carried about him, a\n",
      "pass-key which opened a little side-door; but he must have been\n",
      "searched, and his latch-key must have been taken from him. This point\n",
      "was never explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "He ascended the staircase leading to his chamber. On arriving at the\n",
      "top, he left his candle on the top step of his stairs, opened his door\n",
      "with very little noise, went and closed his window and his shutters by\n",
      "feeling, then returned for his candle and re-entered his room.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a useful precaution; it will be recollected that his window\n",
      "could be seen from the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "He cast a glance about him, at his table, at his chair, at his bed\n",
      "which had not been disturbed for three days. No trace of the disorder\n",
      "of the night before last remained. The portress had “done up” his room;\n",
      "only she had picked out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the\n",
      "two iron ends of the cudgel and the forty-sou piece which had been\n",
      "blackened by the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took a sheet of paper, on which he wrote: “These are the two tips of\n",
      "my iron-shod cudgel and the forty-sou piece stolen from Little Gervais,\n",
      "which I mentioned at the Court of Assizes,” and he arranged this piece\n",
      "of paper, the bits of iron, and the coin in such a way that they were\n",
      "the first things to be seen on entering the room. From a cupboard he\n",
      "pulled out one of his old shirts, which he tore in pieces. In the\n",
      "strips of linen thus prepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks.\n",
      "He betrayed neither haste nor agitation; and while he was wrapping up\n",
      "the Bishop’s candlesticks, he nibbled at a piece of black bread. It was\n",
      "probably the prison-bread which he had carried with him in his flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the room\n",
      "when the authorities made an examination later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "There came two taps at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come in,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Sister Simplice.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was pale; her eyes were red; the candle which she carried trembled\n",
      "in her hand. The peculiar feature of the violences of destiny is, that\n",
      "however polished or cool we may be, they wring human nature from our\n",
      "very bowels, and force it to reappear on the surface. The emotions of\n",
      "that day had turned the nun into a woman once more. She had wept, and\n",
      "she was trembling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean had just finished writing a few lines on a paper, which he\n",
      "handed to the nun, saying, “Sister, you will give this to Monsieur le\n",
      "Curé.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper was not folded. She cast a glance upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can read it,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "She read:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I beg Monsieur le Curé to keep an eye on all that I leave behind me.\n",
      "He will be so good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial, and of\n",
      "the funeral of the woman who died yesterday. The rest is for the poor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The sister tried to speak, but she only managed to stammer a few\n",
      "inarticulate sounds. She succeeded in saying, however:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does not Monsieur le Maire desire to take a last look at that poor,\n",
      "unhappy woman?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said he; “I am pursued; it would only end in their arresting me\n",
      "in that room, and that would disturb her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible on the\n",
      "staircase. They heard a tumult of ascending footsteps, and the old\n",
      "portress saying in her loudest and most piercing tones:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“My good sir, I swear to you by the good God, that not a soul has\n",
      "entered this house all day, nor all the evening, and that I have not\n",
      "even left the door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A man responded:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“But there is a light in that room, nevertheless.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They recognized Javert’s voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chamber was so arranged that the door in opening masked the corner\n",
      "of the wall on the right. Jean Valjean blew out the light and placed\n",
      "himself in this angle. Sister Simplice fell on her knees near the\n",
      "table.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whispers of many men and the protestations of the portress were\n",
      "audible in the corridor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nun did not raise her eyes. She was praying.\n",
      "\n",
      "The candle was on the chimney-piece, and gave but very little light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert caught sight of the nun and halted in amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will be remembered that the fundamental point in Javert, his\n",
      "element, the very air he breathed, was veneration for all authority.\n",
      "This was impregnable, and admitted of neither objection nor\n",
      "restriction. In his eyes, of course, the ecclesiastical authority was\n",
      "the chief of all; he was religious, superficial and correct on this\n",
      "point as on all others. In his eyes, a priest was a mind, who never\n",
      "makes a mistake; a nun was a creature who never sins; they were souls\n",
      "walled in from this world, with a single door which never opened except\n",
      "to allow the truth to pass through.\n",
      "\n",
      "On perceiving the sister, his first movement was to retire.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was also another duty which bound him and impelled him\n",
      "imperiously in the opposite direction. His second movement was to\n",
      "remain and to venture on at least one question.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was Sister Simplice, who had never told a lie in her life. Javert\n",
      "knew it, and held her in special veneration in consequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sister,” said he, “are you alone in this room?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A terrible moment ensued, during which the poor portress felt as though\n",
      "she should faint.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sister raised her eyes and answered:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then,” resumed Javert, “you will excuse me if I persist; it is my\n",
      "duty; you have not seen a certain person—a man—this evening? He has\n",
      "escaped; we are in search of him—that Jean Valjean; you have not seen\n",
      "him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The sister replied:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She lied. She had lied twice in succession, one after the other,\n",
      "without hesitation, promptly, as a person does when sacrificing\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon me,” said Javert, and he retired with a deep bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "O sainted maid! you left this world many years ago; you have rejoined\n",
      "your sisters, the virgins, and your brothers, the angels, in the light;\n",
      "may this lie be counted to your credit in paradise!\n",
      "\n",
      "The sister’s affirmation was for Javert so decisive a thing that he did\n",
      "not even observe the singularity of that candle which had but just been\n",
      "extinguished, and which was still smoking on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "An hour later, a man, marching amid trees and mists, was rapidly\n",
      "departing from M. sur M. in the direction of Paris. That man was Jean\n",
      "Valjean. It has been established by the testimony of two or three\n",
      "carters who met him, that he was carrying a bundle; that he was dressed\n",
      "in a blouse. Where had he obtained that blouse? No one ever found out.\n",
      "But an aged workman had died in the infirmary of the factory a few days\n",
      "before, leaving behind him nothing but his blouse. Perhaps that was the\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "One last word about Fantine.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all have a mother,—the earth. Fantine was given back to that mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "The curé thought that he was doing right, and perhaps he really was, in\n",
      "reserving as much money as possible from what Jean Valjean had left for\n",
      "the poor. Who was concerned, after all? A convict and a woman of the\n",
      "town. That is why he had a very simple funeral for Fantine, and reduced\n",
      "it to that strictly necessary form known as the pauper’s grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Fantine was buried in the free corner of the cemetery which belongs\n",
      "to anybody and everybody, and where the poor are lost. Fortunately, God\n",
      "knows where to find the soul again. Fantine was laid in the shade,\n",
      "among the first bones that came to hand; she was subjected to the\n",
      "promiscuousness of ashes. She was thrown into the public grave. Her\n",
      "grave resembled her bed.\n",

      "\n",
      "Last year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person\n",
      "who is telling this story, was coming from Nivelles, and directing his\n",
      "course towards La Hulpe. He was on foot. He was pursuing a broad paved\n",
      "road, which undulated between two rows of trees, over the hills which\n",
      "succeed each other, raise the road and let it fall again, and produce\n",
      "something in the nature of enormous waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had passed Lillois and Bois-Seigneur-Isaac. In the west he perceived\n",
      "the slate-roofed tower of Braine-l’Alleud, which has the form of a\n",
      "reversed vase. He had just left behind a wood upon an eminence; and at\n",
      "the angle of the crossroad, by the side of a sort of mouldy gibbet\n",
      "bearing the inscription _Ancient Barrier No. 4_, a public house,\n",
      "bearing on its front this sign: _At the Four Winds_ (Aux Quatre Vents).\n",
      "_Échabeau, Private Café_.\n",
      "\n",
      "A quarter of a league further on, he arrived at the bottom of a little\n",
      "valley, where there is water which passes beneath an arch made through\n",
      "the embankment of the road. The clump of sparsely planted but very\n",
      "green trees, which fills the valley on one side of the road, is\n",
      "dispersed over the meadows on the other, and disappears gracefully and\n",
      "as in order in the direction of Braine-l’Alleud.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the right, close to the road, was an inn, with a four-wheeled cart\n",
      "at the door, a large bundle of hop-poles, a plough, a heap of dried\n",
      "brushwood near a flourishing hedge, lime smoking in a square hole, and\n",
      "a ladder suspended along an old penthouse with straw partitions. A\n",
      "young girl was weeding in a field, where a huge yellow poster, probably\n",
      "of some outside spectacle, such as a parish festival, was fluttering in\n",
      "the wind. At one corner of the inn, beside a pool in which a flotilla\n",
      "of ducks was navigating, a badly paved path plunged into the bushes.\n",
      "The wayfarer struck into this.\n",
      "\n",
      "After traversing a hundred paces, skirting a wall of the fifteenth\n",
      "century, surmounted by a pointed gable, with bricks set in contrast, he\n",
      "found himself before a large door of arched stone, with a rectilinear\n",
      "impost, in the sombre style of Louis XIV., flanked by two flat\n",
      "medallions. A severe façade rose above this door; a wall, perpendicular\n",
      "to the façade, almost touched the door, and flanked it with an abrupt\n",
      "right angle. In the meadow before the door lay three harrows, through\n",
      "which, in disorder, grew all the flowers of May. The door was closed.\n",
      "The two decrepit leaves which barred it were ornamented with an old\n",
      "rusty knocker.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was charming; the branches had that soft shivering of May,\n",
      "which seems to proceed rather from the nests than from the wind. A\n",
      "brave little bird, probably a lover, was carolling in a distracted\n",
      "manner in a large tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wayfarer bent over and examined a rather large circular excavation,\n",
      "resembling the hollow of a sphere, in the stone on the left, at the\n",
      "foot of the pier of the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the leaves of the door parted, and a peasant woman\n",
      "emerged.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw the wayfarer, and perceived what he was looking at.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a French cannon-ball which made that,” she said to him. And she\n",
      "added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“That which you see there, higher up in the door, near a nail, is the\n",
      "hole of a big iron bullet as large as an egg. The bullet did not pierce\n",
      "the wood.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the name of this place?” inquired the wayfarer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hougomont,” said the peasant woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "The traveller straightened himself up. He walked on a few paces, and\n",
      "went off to look over the tops of the hedges. On the horizon through\n",
      "the trees, he perceived a sort of little elevation, and on this\n",
      "elevation something which at that distance resembled a lion.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was on the battle-field of Waterloo.\n",

      "CHAPTER II—HOUGOMONT\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hougomont,—this was a funereal spot, the beginning of the obstacle, the\n",
      "first resistance, which that great wood-cutter of Europe, called\n",
      "Napoleon, encountered at Waterloo, the first knot under the blows of\n",
      "his axe.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a château; it is no longer anything but a farm. For the\n",
      "antiquary, Hougomont is _Hugomons_. This manor was built by Hugo, Sire\n",
      "of Somerel, the same who endowed the sixth chaplaincy of the Abbey of\n",
      "Villiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The traveller pushed open the door, elbowed an ancient calash under the\n",
      "porch, and entered the courtyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of the\n",
      "sixteenth century, which here simulates an arcade, everything else\n",
      "having fallen prostrate around it. A monumental aspect often has its\n",
      "birth in ruin. In a wall near the arcade opens another arched door, of\n",
      "the time of Henry IV., permitting a glimpse of the trees of an orchard;\n",
      "beside this door, a manure-hole, some pickaxes, some shovels, some\n",
      "carts, an old well, with its flagstone and its iron reel, a chicken\n",
      "jumping, and a turkey spreading its tail, a chapel surmounted by a\n",
      "small bell-tower, a blossoming pear-tree trained in espalier against\n",
      "the wall of the chapel—behold the court, the conquest of which was one\n",
      "of Napoleon’s dreams. This corner of earth, could he but have seized\n",
      "it, would, perhaps, have given him the world likewise. Chickens are\n",
      "scattering its dust abroad with their beaks. A growl is audible; it is\n",
      "a huge dog, who shows his teeth and replaces the English.\n",
      "\n",
      "The English behaved admirably there. Cooke’s four companies of guards\n",
      "there held out for seven hours against the fury of an army.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hougomont viewed on the map, as a geometrical plan, comprising\n",
      "buildings and enclosures, presents a sort of irregular rectangle, one\n",
      "angle of which is nicked out. It is this angle which contains the\n",
      "southern door, guarded by this wall, which commands it only a gun’s\n",
      "length away. Hougomont has two doors,—the southern door, that of the\n",
      "château; and the northern door, belonging to the farm. Napoleon sent\n",
      "his brother Jérôme against Hougomont; the divisions of Foy,\n",
      "Guilleminot, and Bachelu hurled themselves against it; nearly the\n",
      "entire corps of Reille was employed against it, and miscarried;\n",
      "Kellermann’s balls were exhausted on this heroic section of wall.\n",
      "Bauduin’s brigade was not strong enough to force Hougomont on the\n",
      "north, and the brigade of Soye could not do more than effect the\n",
      "beginning of a breach on the south, but without taking it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The farm buildings border the courtyard on the south. A bit of the\n",
      "north door, broken by the French, hangs suspended to the wall. It\n",
      "consists of four planks nailed to two cross-beams, on which the scars\n",
      "of the attack are visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The northern door, which was beaten in by the French, and which has had\n",
      "a piece applied to it to replace the panel suspended on the wall,\n",
      "stands half-open at the bottom of the paddock; it is cut squarely in\n",
      "the wall, built of stone below, of brick above which closes in the\n",
      "courtyard on the north. It is a simple door for carts, such as exist in\n",
      "all farms, with the two large leaves made of rustic planks: beyond lie\n",
      "the meadows. The dispute over this entrance was furious. For a long\n",
      "time, all sorts of imprints of bloody hands were visible on the\n",
      "door-posts. It was there that Bauduin was killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The storm of the combat still lingers in this courtyard; its horror is\n",
      "visible there; the confusion of the fray was petrified there; it lives\n",
      "and it dies there; it was only yesterday. The walls are in the death\n",
      "agony, the stones fall; the breaches cry aloud; the holes are wounds;\n",
      "the drooping, quivering trees seem to be making an effort to flee.\n",
      "\n",
      "This courtyard was more built up in 1815 than it is to-day. Buildings\n",
      "which have since been pulled down then formed redans and angles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The English barricaded themselves there; the French made their way in,\n",
      "but could not stand their ground. Beside the chapel, one wing of the\n",
      "château, the only ruin now remaining of the manor of Hougomont, rises\n",
      "in a crumbling state,—disembowelled, one might say. The château served\n",
      "for a dungeon, the chapel for a block-house. There men exterminated\n",
      "each other. The French, fired on from every point,—from behind the\n",
      "walls, from the summits of the garrets, from the depths of the cellars,\n",
      "through all the casements, through all the air-holes, through every\n",
      "crack in the stones,—fetched fagots and set fire to walls and men; the\n",
      "reply to the grape-shot was a conflagration.\n",
      "\n",

      "English guards were in ambush in these rooms; the spiral of the\n",
      "staircase, cracked from the ground floor to the very roof, appears like\n",
      "the inside of a broken shell. The staircase has two stories; the\n",
      "English, besieged on the staircase, and massed on its upper steps, had\n",
      "cut off the lower steps. These consisted of large slabs of blue stone,\n",
      "which form a heap among the nettles. Half a score of steps still cling\n",
      "to the wall; on the first is cut the figure of a trident. These\n",
      "inaccessible steps are solid in their niches. All the rest resembles a\n",

      "carnage. Nevertheless, the altar has been left there—an altar of\n",
      "unpolished wood, placed against a background of roughhewn stone. Four\n",
      "whitewashed walls, a door opposite the altar, two small arched windows;\n",
      "over the door a large wooden crucifix, below the crucifix a square\n",
      "air-hole stopped up with a bundle of hay; on the ground, in one corner,\n",
      "an old window-frame with the glass all broken to pieces—such is the\n",
      "chapel. Near the altar there is nailed up a wooden statue of Saint\n",
      "Anne, of the fifteenth century; the head of the infant Jesus has been\n",
      "carried off by a large ball. The French, who were masters of the chapel\n",
      "for a moment, and were then dislodged, set fire to it. The flames\n",
      "filled this building; it was a perfect furnace; the door was burned,\n",
      "the floor was burned, the wooden Christ was not burned. The fire preyed\n",
      "upon his feet, of which only the blackened stumps are now to be seen;\n",
      "then it stopped,—a miracle, according to the assertion of the people of\n",
      "the neighborhood. The infant Jesus, decapitated, was less fortunate\n",
      "than the Christ.\n",
      "\n",
      "The walls are covered with inscriptions. Near the feet of Christ this\n",
      "name is to be read: _Henquinez_. Then these others: _Conde de Rio Maior\n",
      "Marques y Marquesa de Almagro (Habana)_. There are French names with\n",
      "exclamation points,—a sign of wrath. The wall was freshly whitewashed\n",
      "in 1849. The nations insulted each other there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at the door of this chapel that the corpse was picked up which\n",
      "held an axe in its hand; this corpse was Sub-Lieutenant Legros.\n",

      "On emerging from the chapel, a well is visible on the left. There are\n",
      "two in this courtyard. One inquires, Why is there no bucket and pulley\n",
      "to this? It is because water is no longer drawn there. Why is water not\n",
      "drawn there? Because it is full of skeletons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last person who drew water from the well was named Guillaume van\n",
      "Kylsom. He was a peasant who lived at Hougomont, and was gardener\n",
      "there. On the 18th of June, 1815, his family fled and concealed\n",
      "themselves in the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The forest surrounding the Abbey of Villiers sheltered these\n",
      "unfortunate people who had been scattered abroad, for many days and\n",
      "nights. There are at this day certain traces recognizable, such as old\n",
      "boles of burned trees, which mark the site of these poor bivouacs\n",
      "trembling in the depths of the thickets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guillaume van Kylsom remained at Hougomont, “to guard the château,” and\n",

      "tore him from his hiding-place, and the combatants forced this\n",
      "frightened man to serve them, by administering blows with the flats of\n",
      "their swords. They were thirsty; this Guillaume brought them water. It\n",
      "was from this well that he drew it. Many drank there their last\n",
      "draught. This well where drank so many of the dead was destined to die\n",
      "itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the engagement, they were in haste to bury the dead bodies. Death\n",
      "has a fashion of harassing victory, and she causes the pest to follow\n",
      "glory. The typhus is a concomitant of triumph. This well was deep, and\n",
      "it was turned into a sepulchre. Three hundred dead bodies were cast\n",
      "into it. With too much haste perhaps. Were they all dead? Legend says\n",
      "they were not. It seems that on the night succeeding the interment,\n",
      "feeble voices were heard calling from the well.\n",
      "\n",
      "This well is isolated in the middle of the courtyard. Three walls, part\n",
      "stone, part brick, and simulating a small, square tower, and folded\n",
      "like the leaves of a screen, surround it on all sides. The fourth side\n",
      "is open. It is there that the water was drawn. The wall at the bottom\n",
      "has a sort of shapeless loophole, possibly the hole made by a shell.\n",
      "This little tower had a platform, of which only the beams remain. The\n",
      "iron supports of the well on the right form a cross. On leaning over,\n",
      "the eye is lost in a deep cylinder of brick which is filled with a\n",
      "heaped-up mass of shadows. The base of the walls all about the well is\n",
      "concealed in a growth of nettles.\n",
      "\n",
      "This well has not in front of it that large blue slab which forms the\n",
      "table for all wells in Belgium. The slab has here been replaced by a\n",
      "cross-beam, against which lean five or six shapeless fragments of\n",
      "knotty and petrified wood which resemble huge bones. There is no longer\n",
      "either pail, chain, or pulley; but there is still the stone basin which\n",
      "served the overflow. The rain-water collects there, and from time to\n",
      "time a bird of the neighboring forests comes thither to drink, and then\n",
      "flies away. One house in this ruin, the farmhouse, is still inhabited.\n",
      "The door of this house opens on the courtyard. Upon this door, beside a\n",
      "pretty Gothic lock-plate, there is an iron handle with trefoils placed\n",
      "slanting. At the moment when the Hanoverian lieutenant, Wilda, grasped\n",
      "this handle in order to take refuge in the farm, a French sapper hewed\n",
      "off his hand with an axe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The family who occupy the house had for their grandfather Guillaume van\n",
      "Kylsom, the old gardener, dead long since. A woman with gray hair said\n",
      "to us: “I was there. I was three years old. My sister, who was older,\n",
      "was terrified and wept. They carried us off to the woods. I went there\n",
      "in my mother’s arms. We glued our ears to the earth to hear. I imitated\n",

      "\n",
      "It is in three parts; one might almost say, in three acts. The first\n",
      "part is a garden, the second is an orchard, the third is a wood. These\n",
      "three parts have a common enclosure: on the side of the entrance, the\n",
      "buildings of the château and the farm; on the left, a hedge; on the\n",
      "right, a wall; and at the end, a wall. The wall on the right is of\n",
      "brick, the wall at the bottom is of stone. One enters the garden first.\n",
      "It slopes downwards, is planted with gooseberry bushes, choked with a\n",
      "wild growth of vegetation, and terminated by a monumental terrace of\n",
      "cut stone, with balustrade with a double curve.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a seignorial garden in the first French style which preceded Le\n",
      "Nôtre; to-day it is ruins and briars. The pilasters are surmounted by\n",
      "globes which resemble cannon-balls of stone. Forty-three balusters can\n",
      "still be counted on their sockets; the rest lie prostrate in the grass.\n",
      "Almost all bear scratches of bullets. One broken baluster is placed on\n",
      "the pediment like a fractured leg.\n",

      "light-infantry men of the 1st, having made their way thither, and being\n",
      "unable to escape, hunted down and caught like bears in their dens,\n",
      "accepted the combat with two Hanoverian companies, one of which was\n",
      "armed with carbines. The Hanoverians lined this balustrade and fired\n",
      "from above. The infantry men, replying from below, six against two\n",
      "hundred, intrepid and with no shelter save the currant-bushes, took a\n",
      "quarter of an hour to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "One mounts a few steps and passes from the garden into the orchard,\n",
      "properly speaking. There, within the limits of those few square\n",
      "fathoms, fifteen hundred men fell in less than an hour. The wall seems\n",
      "ready to renew the combat. Thirty-eight loopholes, pierced by the\n",
      "English at irregular heights, are there still. In front of the sixth\n",
      "are placed two English tombs of granite. There are loopholes only in\n",
      "the south wall, as the principal attack came from that quarter. The\n",
      "wall is hidden on the outside by a tall hedge; the French came up,\n",
      "thinking that they had to deal only with a hedge, crossed it, and found\n",
      "the wall both an obstacle and an ambuscade, with the English guards\n",
      "behind it, the thirty-eight loopholes firing at once a shower of\n",
      "grape-shot and balls, and Soye’s brigade was broken against it. Thus\n",
      "Waterloo began.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, the orchard was taken. As they had no ladders, the French\n",
      "scaled it with their nails. They fought hand to hand amid the trees.\n",
      "All this grass has been soaked in blood. A battalion of Nassau, seven\n",
      "hundred strong, was overwhelmed there. The outside of the wall, against\n",
      "which Kellermann’s two batteries were trained, is gnawed by grape-shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "This orchard is sentient, like others, in the month of May. It has its\n",
      "buttercups and its daisies; the grass is tall there; the cart-horses\n",
      "browse there; cords of hair, on which linen is drying, traverse the\n",
      "spaces between the trees and force the passer-by to bend his head; one\n",
      "walks over this uncultivated land, and one’s foot dives into\n",
      "mole-holes. In the middle of the grass one observes an uprooted\n",
      "tree-bole which lies there all verdant. Major Blackmann leaned against\n",
      "it to die. Beneath a great tree in the neighborhood fell the German\n",
      "general, Duplat, descended from a French family which fled on the\n",

      "clayey loam. Nearly all the apple-trees are falling with age. There is\n",
      "not one which has not had its bullet or its biscayan.6 The skeletons of\n",

      "of water, more or less, decided the downfall of Napoleon. All that\n",
      "Providence required in order to make Waterloo the end of Austerlitz was\n",
      "a little more rain, and a cloud traversing the sky out of season\n",
      "sufficed to make a world crumble.\n",
      "\n",
      "The battle of Waterloo could not be begun until half-past eleven\n",

      "before they could manœuvre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Napoleon was an artillery officer, and felt the effects of this. The\n",
      "foundation of this wonderful captain was the man who, in the report to\n",
      "the Directory on Aboukir, said: _Such a one of our balls killed six\n",
      "men_. All his plans of battle were arranged for projectiles. The key to\n",
      "his victory was to make the artillery converge on one point. He treated\n",
      "the strategy of the hostile general like a citadel, and made a breach\n",
      "in it. He overwhelmed the weak point with grape-shot; he joined and\n",
      "dissolved battles with cannon. There was something of the sharpshooter\n",
      "in his genius. To beat in squares, to pulverize regiments, to break\n",
      "lines, to crush and disperse masses,—for him everything lay in this, to\n",
      "strike, strike, strike incessantly,—and he intrusted this task to the\n",
      "cannon-ball. A redoubtable method, and one which, united with genius,\n",

      "\n",
      "On the 18th of June, 1815, he relied all the more on his artillery,\n",
      "because he had numbers on his side. Wellington had only one hundred and\n",

      "of sinister amazement when he could lead his tumultuous legions\n",
      "harnessed to it, to the precipice? Was he seized at the age of\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one is acquainted with the first phase of this battle; a\n",
      "beginning which was troubled, uncertain, hesitating, menacing to both\n",
      "armies, but still more so for the English than for the French.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had rained all night, the earth had been cut up by the downpour, the\n",
      "water had accumulated here and there in the hollows of the plain as if\n",
      "in casks; at some points the gear of the artillery carriages was buried\n",
      "up to the axles, the circingles of the horses were dripping with liquid\n",
      "mud. If the wheat and rye trampled down by this cohort of transports on\n",
      "the march had not filled in the ruts and strewn a litter beneath the\n",
      "wheels, all movement, particularly in the valleys, in the direction of\n",
      "Papelotte would have been impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The affair began late. Napoleon, as we have already explained, was in\n",
      "the habit of keeping all his artillery well in hand, like a pistol,\n",
      "aiming it now at one point, now at another, of the battle; and it had\n",
      "been his wish to wait until the horse batteries could move and gallop\n",
      "freely. In order to do that it was necessary that the sun should come\n",
      "out and dry the soil. But the sun did not make its appearance. It was\n",
      "no longer the rendezvous of Austerlitz. When the first cannon was\n",
      "fired, the English general, Colville, looked at his watch, and noted\n",
      "that it was thirty-five minutes past eleven.\n",
      "\n",
      "The action was begun furiously, with more fury, perhaps, than the\n",
      "Emperor would have wished, by the left wing of the French resting on\n",
      "Hougomont. At the same time Napoleon attacked the centre by hurling\n",
      "Quiot’s brigade on La Haie-Sainte, and Ney pushed forward the right\n",
      "wing of the French against the left wing of the English, which rested\n",
      "on Papelotte.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attack on Hougomont was something of a feint; the plan was to draw\n",
      "Wellington thither, and to make him swerve to the left. This plan would\n",
      "have succeeded if the four companies of the English guards and the\n",
      "brave Belgians of Perponcher’s division had not held the position\n",
      "solidly, and Wellington, instead of massing his troops there, could\n",
      "confine himself to despatching thither, as reinforcements, only four\n",
      "more companies of guards and one battalion from Brunswick.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attack of the right wing of the French on Papelotte was calculated,\n",
      "in fact, to overthrow the English left, to cut off the road to\n",
      "Brussels, to bar the passage against possible Prussians, to force\n",
      "Mont-Saint-Jean, to turn Wellington back on Hougomont, thence on\n",
      "Braine-l’Alleud, thence on Hal; nothing easier. With the exception of a\n",
      "few incidents this attack succeeded. Papelotte was taken; La\n",
      "Haie-Sainte was carried.\n",
      "\n",
      "A detail to be noted. There was in the English infantry, particularly\n",
      "in Kempt’s brigade, a great many raw recruits. These young soldiers\n",
      "were valiant in the presence of our redoubtable infantry; their\n",
      "inexperience extricated them intrepidly from the dilemma; they\n",
      "performed particularly excellent service as skirmishers: the soldier\n",
      "skirmisher, left somewhat to himself, becomes, so to speak, his own\n",
      "general. These recruits displayed some of the French ingenuity and\n",
      "fury. This novice of an infantry had dash. This displeased Wellington.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the taking of La Haie-Sainte the battle wavered.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is in this day an obscure interval, from midday to four o’clock;\n",
      "the middle portion of this battle is almost indistinct, and\n",
      "participates in the sombreness of the hand-to-hand conflict. Twilight\n",
      "reigns over it. We perceive vast fluctuations in that fog, a dizzy\n",
      "mirage, paraphernalia of war almost unknown to-day, pendant colbacks,\n",
      "floating sabre-taches, cross-belts, cartridge-boxes for grenades,\n",
      "hussar dolmans, red boots with a thousand wrinkles, heavy shakos\n",
      "garlanded with torsades, the almost black infantry of Brunswick mingled\n",
      "with the scarlet infantry of England, the English soldiers with great,\n",
      "white circular pads on the slopes of their shoulders for epaulets, the\n",
      "Hanoverian light-horse with their oblong casques of leather, with brass\n",
      "hands and red horse-tails, the Scotch with their bare knees and plaids,\n",
      "the great white gaiters of our grenadiers; pictures, not strategic\n",
      "lines—what Salvator Rosa requires, not what is suited to the needs of\n",
      "Gribeauval.\n",
      "\n",
      "A certain amount of tempest is always mingled with a battle. _Quid\n",
      "obscurum, quid divinum_. Each historian traces, to some extent, the\n",
      "particular feature which pleases him amid this pell-mell. Whatever may\n",
      "be the combinations of the generals, the shock of armed masses has an\n",
      "incalculable ebb. During the action the plans of the two leaders enter\n",
      "into each other and become mutually thrown out of shape. Such a point\n",
      "of the field of battle devours more combatants than such another, just\n",
      "as more or less spongy soils soak up more or less quickly the water\n",
      "which is poured on them. It becomes necessary to pour out more soldiers\n",
      "than one would like; a series of expenditures which are the unforeseen.\n",
      "The line of battle waves and undulates like a thread, the trails of\n",
      "blood gush illogically, the fronts of the armies waver, the regiments\n",
      "form capes and gulfs as they enter and withdraw; all these reefs are\n",
      "continually moving in front of each other. Where the infantry stood the\n",
      "artillery arrives, the cavalry rushes in where the artillery was, the\n",
      "battalions are like smoke. There was something there; seek it. It has\n",
      "disappeared; the open spots change place, the sombre folds advance and\n",
      "retreat, a sort of wind from the sepulchre pushes forward, hurls back,\n",
      "distends, and disperses these tragic multitudes. What is a fray? an\n",
      "oscillation? The immobility of a mathematical plan expresses a minute,\n",
      "not a day. In order to depict a battle, there is required one of those\n",
      "powerful painters who have chaos in their brushes. Rembrandt is better\n",

      "Geometry is deceptive; the hurricane alone is trustworthy. That is what\n",
      "confers on Folard the right to contradict Polybius. Let us add, that\n",
      "there is a certain instant when the battle degenerates into a combat,\n",
      "becomes specialized, and disperses into innumerable detailed feats,\n",
      "which, to borrow the expression of Napoleon himself, “belong rather to\n",
      "the biography of the regiments than to the history of the army.” The\n",
      "historian has, in this case, the evident right to sum up the whole. He\n",

      "Towards four o’clock the condition of the English army was serious. The\n",
      "Prince of Orange was in command of the centre, Hill of the right wing,\n",
      "Picton of the left wing. The Prince of Orange, desperate and intrepid,\n",
      "shouted to the Hollando-Belgians: “Nassau! Brunswick! Never retreat!”\n",
      "Hill, having been weakened, had come up to the support of Wellington;\n",
      "Picton was dead. At the very moment when the English had captured from\n",
      "the French the flag of the 105th of the line, the French had killed the\n",
      "English general, Picton, with a bullet through the head. The battle\n",
      "had, for Wellington, two bases of action, Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte;\n",
      "Hougomont still held out, but was on fire; La Haie-Sainte was taken. Of\n",
      "the German battalion which defended it, only forty-two men survived;\n",
      "all the officers, except five, were either dead or captured. Three\n",
      "thousand combatants had been massacred in that barn. A sergeant of the\n",
      "English Guards, the foremost boxer in England, reputed invulnerable by\n",
      "his companions, had been killed there by a little French drummer-boy.\n",
      "Baring had been dislodged, Alten put to the sword. Many flags had been\n",
      "lost, one from Alten’s division, and one from the battalion of\n",
      "Lunenburg, carried by a prince of the house of Deux-Ponts. The Scotch\n",
      "Grays no longer existed; Ponsonby’s great dragoons had been hacked to\n",
      "pieces. That valiant cavalry had bent beneath the lancers of Bro and\n",
      "beneath the cuirassiers of Travers; out of twelve hundred horses, six\n",
      "hundred remained; out of three lieutenant-colonels, two lay on the\n",
      "earth,—Hamilton wounded, Mater slain. Ponsonby had fallen, riddled by\n",
      "seven lance-thrusts. Gordon was dead. Marsh was dead. Two divisions,\n",
      "the fifth and the sixth, had been annihilated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hougomont injured, La Haie-Sainte taken, there now existed but one\n",
      "rallying-point, the centre. That point still held firm. Wellington\n",
      "reinforced it. He summoned thither Hill, who was at Merle-Braine; he\n",
      "summoned Chassé, who was at Braine-l’Alleud.\n",
      "\n",
      "The centre of the English army, rather concave, very dense, and very\n",
      "compact, was strongly posted. It occupied the plateau of\n",
      "Mont-Saint-Jean, having behind it the village, and in front of it the\n",
      "slope, which was tolerably steep then. It rested on that stout stone\n",
      "dwelling which at that time belonged to the domain of Nivelles, and\n",
      "which marks the intersection of the roads—a pile of the sixteenth\n",
      "century, and so robust that the cannon-balls rebounded from it without\n",
      "injuring it. All about the plateau the English had cut the hedges here\n",
      "and there, made embrasures in the hawthorn-trees, thrust the throat of\n",
      "a cannon between two branches, embattled the shrubs. There artillery\n",
      "was ambushed in the brushwood. This punic labor, incontestably\n",
      "authorized by war, which permits traps, was so well done, that Haxo,\n",
      "who had been despatched by the Emperor at nine o’clock in the morning\n",
      "to reconnoitre the enemy’s batteries, had discovered nothing of it, and\n",
      "had returned and reported to Napoleon that there were no obstacles\n",
      "except the two barricades which barred the road to Nivelles and to\n",
      "Genappe. It was at the season when the grain is tall; on the edge of\n",
      "the plateau a battalion of Kempt’s brigade, the 95th, armed with\n",
      "carabines, was concealed in the tall wheat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus assured and buttressed, the centre of the Anglo-Dutch army was\n",
      "well posted. The peril of this position lay in the forest of Soignes,\n",
      "then adjoining the field of battle, and intersected by the ponds of\n",
      "Groenendael and Boitsfort. An army could not retreat thither without\n",
      "dissolving; the regiments would have broken up immediately there. The\n",
      "artillery would have been lost among the morasses. The retreat,\n",
      "according to many a man versed in the art,—though it is disputed by\n",
      "others,—would have been a disorganized flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this centre, Wellington added one of Chassé’s brigades taken from\n",
      "the right wing, and one of Wincke’s brigades taken from the left wing,\n",
      "plus Clinton’s division. To his English, to the regiments of Halkett,\n",
      "to the brigades of Mitchell, to the guards of Maitland, he gave as\n",
      "reinforcements and aids, the infantry of Brunswick, Nassau’s\n",
      "contingent, Kielmansegg’s Hanoverians, and Ompteda’s Germans. This\n",
      "placed twenty-six battalions under his hand. _The right wing_, as\n",
      "Charras says, _was thrown back on the centre_. An enormous battery was\n",
      "masked by sacks of earth at the spot where there now stands what is\n",
      "called the “Museum of Waterloo.” Besides this, Wellington had, behind a\n",
      "rise in the ground, Somerset’s Dragoon Guards, fourteen hundred horse\n",
      "strong. It was the remaining half of the justly celebrated English\n",
      "cavalry. Ponsonby destroyed, Somerset remained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The battery, which, if completed, would have been almost a redoubt, was\n",
      "ranged behind a very low garden wall, backed up with a coating of bags\n",
      "of sand and a large slope of earth. This work was not finished; there\n",
      "had been no time to make a palisade for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wellington, uneasy but impassive, was on horseback, and there remained\n",
      "the whole day in the same attitude, a little in advance of the old mill\n",
      "of Mont-Saint-Jean, which is still in existence, beneath an elm, which\n",
      "an Englishman, an enthusiastic vandal, purchased later on for two\n",
      "hundred francs, cut down, and carried off. Wellington was coldly\n",
      "heroic. The bullets rained about him. His aide-de-camp, Gordon, fell at\n",
      "his side. Lord Hill, pointing to a shell which had burst, said to him:\n",
      "“My lord, what are your orders in case you are killed?” “To do like\n",
      "me,” replied Wellington. To Clinton he said laconically, “To hold this\n",
      "spot to the last man.” The day was evidently turning out ill.\n",

      "Towards four o’clock, the English line drew back. Suddenly nothing was\n",

      "the shells and the French bullets, retreated into the bottom, now\n",
      "intersected by the back road of the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean; a\n",

      "sometimes a dozen feet in depth, and whose banks, being too steep,\n",

      "which burst upon them, the terrible muddy slope of the table-land of\n",
      "Mont-Saint-Jean. They ascended, grave, threatening, imperturbable; in\n",
      "the intervals between the musketry and the artillery, their colossal\n",
      "trampling was audible. Being two divisions, there were two columns of\n",

      "on the second; the horses reared and fell backward, landed on their\n",
      "haunches, slid down, all four feet in the air, crushing and\n",
      "overwhelming the riders; and there being no means of retreat,—the whole\n",
      "column being no longer anything more than a projectile,—the force which\n",
      "had been acquired to crush the English crushed the French; the\n",
      "inexorable ravine could only yield when filled; horses and riders\n",
      "rolled there pell-mell, grinding each other, forming but one mass of\n",
      "flesh in this gulf: when this trench was full of living men, the rest\n",
      "marched over them and passed on. Almost a third of Dubois’s brigade\n",

      "their guns, the front of the square parted, permitted the passage of an\n",
      "eruption of grape-shot, and closed again. The cuirassiers replied by\n",
      "crushing them. Their great horses reared, strode across the ranks,\n",
      "leaped over the bayonets and fell, gigantic, in the midst of these four\n",
      "living wells. The cannon-balls ploughed furrows in these cuirassiers;\n",
      "the cuirassiers made breaches in the squares. Files of men disappeared,\n",
      "ground to dust under the horses. The bayonets plunged into the bellies\n",
      "of these centaurs; hence a hideousness of wounds which has probably\n",
      "never been seen anywhere else. The squares, wasted by this mad cavalry,\n",
      "closed up their ranks without flinching. Inexhaustible in the matter of\n",

      "Mont-Saint-Jean, at the very point where the four roads from Nivelles,\n",
      "Genappe, La Hulpe, and Brussels meet and intersect each other. This\n",
      "horseman had pierced the English lines. One of the men who picked up\n",
      "the body still lives at Mont-Saint-Jean. His name is Dehaze. He was\n",
      "eighteen years old at that time.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The cuirassiers had not succeeded, since the centre was not broken\n",
      "through. As every one was in possession of the plateau, no one held it,\n",
      "and in fact it remained, to a great extent, with the English.\n",
      "Wellington held the village and the culminating plain; Ney had only the\n",
      "crest and the slope. They seemed rooted in that fatal soil on both\n",
      "sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the weakening of the English seemed irremediable. The bleeding of\n",
      "that army was horrible. Kempt, on the left wing, demanded\n",
      "reinforcements. “There are none,” replied Wellington; “he must let\n",
      "himself be killed!” Almost at that same moment, a singular coincidence\n",
      "which paints the exhaustion of the two armies, Ney demanded infantry\n",
      "from Napoleon, and Napoleon exclaimed, “Infantry! Where does he expect\n",
      "me to get it? Does he think I can make it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, the English army was in the worse case of the two. The\n",
      "furious onsets of those great squadrons with cuirasses of iron and\n",
      "breasts of steel had ground the infantry to nothing. A few men\n",
      "clustered round a flag marked the post of a regiment; such and such a\n",
      "battalion was commanded only by a captain or a lieutenant; Alten’s\n",
      "division, already so roughly handled at La Haie-Sainte, was almost\n",
      "destroyed; the intrepid Belgians of Van Kluze’s brigade strewed the\n",
      "rye-fields all along the Nivelles road; hardly anything was left of\n",
      "those Dutch grenadiers, who, intermingled with Spaniards in our ranks\n",
      "in 1811, fought against Wellington; and who, in 1815, rallied to the\n",
      "English standard, fought against Napoleon. The loss in officers was\n",
      "considerable. Lord Uxbridge, who had his leg buried on the following\n",
      "day, had his knee shattered. If, on the French side, in that tussle of\n",
      "the cuirassiers, Delort, l’Héritier, Colbert, Dnop, Travers, and\n",
      "Blancard were disabled, on the side of the English there was Alten\n",
      "wounded, Barne wounded, Delancey killed, Van Meeren killed, Ompteda\n",
      "killed, the whole of Wellington’s staff decimated, and England had the\n",
      "worse of it in that bloody scale. The second regiment of foot-guards\n",
      "had lost five lieutenant-colonels, four captains, and three ensigns;\n",
      "the first battalion of the 30th infantry had lost 24 officers and 1,200\n",
      "soldiers; the 79th Highlanders had lost 24 officers wounded, 18\n",
      "officers killed, 450 soldiers killed. The Hanoverian hussars of\n",
      "Cumberland, a whole regiment, with Colonel Hacke at its head, who was\n",
      "destined to be tried later on and cashiered, had turned bridle in the\n",
      "presence of the fray, and had fled to the forest of Soignes, sowing\n",
      "defeat all the way to Brussels. The transports, ammunition-wagons, the\n",
      "baggage-wagons, the wagons filled with wounded, on perceiving that the\n",
      "French were gaining ground and approaching the forest, rushed headlong\n",
      "thither. The Dutch, mowed down by the French cavalry, cried, “Alarm!”\n",
      "From Vert-Coucou to Groenendael, for a distance of nearly two leagues\n",
      "in the direction of Brussels, according to the testimony of\n",
      "eye-witnesses who are still alive, the roads were encumbered with\n",
      "fugitives. This panic was such that it attacked the Prince de Condé at\n",

      "flanked the left wing, Wellington had no cavalry left. A number of\n",

      "Pringle, exaggerating the disaster, goes so far as to say that the\n",
      "Anglo-Dutch army was reduced to thirty-four thousand men. The Iron Duke\n",
      "remained calm, but his lips blanched. Vincent, the Austrian\n",
      "commissioner, Alava, the Spanish commissioner, who were present at the\n",

      "French, so the caissons and ammunition-wagons could not pass between\n",

      "\n",
      "A few paces in front of him, in the hollow road, at the point where the\n",

      "attitude, with his back turned to the heap of dead, scanning the\n",
      "horizon on his knees, with the whole upper portion of his body\n",
      "supported on his two forefingers, which rested on the earth, and his\n",
      "head peering above the edge of the hollow road. The jackal’s four paws\n",
      "suit some actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then coming to a decision, he rose to his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, he gave a terrible start. He felt some one clutch him\n",
      "from behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wheeled round; it was the open hand, which had closed, and had\n",
      "seized the skirt of his coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "An honest man would have been terrified; this man burst into a laugh.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "that was in his way, seized the hand, grasped the arm, freed the head,\n",
      "pulled out the body, and a few moments later he was dragging the\n",
      "lifeless, or at least the unconscious, man, through the shadows of\n",
      "hollow road. He was a cuirassier, an officer, and even an officer of\n",
      "considerable rank; a large gold epaulette peeped from beneath the\n",
      "cuirass; this officer no longer possessed a helmet. A furious sword-cut\n",
      "had scarred his face, where nothing was discernible but blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he did not appear to have any broken limbs, and, by some happy\n",
      "chance, if that word is permissible here, the dead had been vaulted\n",
      "above him in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed. His\n",
      "eyes were still closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "On his cuirass he wore the silver cross of the Legion of Honor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prowler tore off this cross, which disappeared into one of the\n",
      "gulfs which he had beneath his great coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he felt of the officer’s fob, discovered a watch there, and took\n",
      "possession of it. Next he searched his waistcoat, found a purse and\n",
      "pocketed it.\n",

      "\n",
      "The abruptness of the movements of the man who was manipulating him,\n",
      "the freshness of the night, the air which he could inhale freely, had\n",

      "\n",
      "The prowler made no reply. He raised his head. A sound of footsteps was\n",
      "audible in the plain; some patrol was probably approaching.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "“There is nothing there.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "the new methods, resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry,\n",
      "the manufacture of jet and of black glass trinkets. He had made his\n",
      "fortune in the business, and that of the arrondissement as well, we\n",
      "will admit. He had been appointed mayor, in recognition of his\n",
      "services. The police discovered that M. Madeleine was no other than an\n",
      "ex-convict who had broken his ban, condemned in 1796 for theft, and\n",
      "named Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean has been recommitted to prison. It\n",
      "appears that previous to his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing\n",
      "from the hands of M. Laffitte, a sum of over half a million which he\n",
      "had lodged there, and which he had, moreover, and by perfectly\n",
      "legitimate means, acquired in his business. No one has been able to\n",

      "The second article, which enters a little more into detail, is an\n",

      "A former convict, who had been liberated, named Jean Valjean, has just\n",
      "appeared before the Court of Assizes of the Var, under circumstances\n",
      "calculated to attract attention. This wretch had succeeded in escaping\n",
      "the vigilance of the police, he had changed his name, and had succeeded\n",
      "in getting himself appointed mayor of one of our small northern towns;\n",
      "in this town he had established a considerable commerce. He has at last\n",
      "been unmasked and arrested, thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the\n",
      "public prosecutor. He had for his concubine a woman of the town, who\n",
      "died of a shock at the moment of his arrest. This scoundrel, who is\n",
      "endowed with Herculean strength, found means to escape; but three or\n",
      "four days after his flight the police laid their hands on him once\n",
      "more, in Paris itself, at the very moment when he was entering one of\n",
      "those little vehicles which run between the capital and the village of\n",
      "Montfermeil (Seine-et-Oise). He is said to have profited by this\n",
      "interval of three or four days of liberty, to withdraw a considerable\n",
      "sum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers. This sum has been\n",
      "estimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs. If the indictment is\n",
      "to be trusted, he has hidden it in some place known to himself alone,\n",
      "and it has not been possible to lay hands on it. However that may be,\n",
      "the said Jean Valjean has just been brought before the Assizes of the\n",
      "Department of the Var as accused of highway robbery accompanied with\n",
      "violence, about eight years ago, on the person of one of those honest\n",
      "children who, as the patriarch of Ferney has said, in immortal verse,\n",

      "\n",
      "This bandit refused to defend himself. It was proved by the skilful and\n",
      "eloquent representative of the public prosecutor, that the theft was\n",
      "committed in complicity with others, and that Jean Valjean was a member\n",
      "of a band of robbers in the south. Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty\n",
      "and was condemned to the death penalty in consequence. This criminal\n",
      "refused to lodge an appeal. The king, in his inexhaustible clemency,\n",
      "has deigned to commute his penalty to that of penal servitude for life.\n",
      "Jean Valjean was immediately taken to the prison at Toulon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reader has not forgotten that Jean Valjean had religious habits at\n",

      "obliged to recur to the subject, the prosperity of M. sur M. vanished\n",
      "with M. Madeleine; all that he had foreseen during his night of fever\n",

      "obscurely, in the human community, and which history has noted only\n",
      "once, because it occurred after the death of Alexander. Lieutenants are\n",
      "crowned kings; superintendents improvise manufacturers out of\n",
      "themselves. Envious rivalries arose. M. Madeleine’s vast workshops were\n",
      "shut; his buildings fell to ruin, his workmen were scattered. Some of\n",
      "them quitted the country, others abandoned the trade. Thenceforth,\n",
      "everything was done on a small scale, instead of on a grand scale; for\n",
      "lucre instead of the general good. There was no longer a centre;\n",
      "everywhere there was competition and animosity. M. Madeleine had\n",
      "reigned over all and directed all. No sooner had he fallen, than each\n",
      "pulled things to himself; the spirit of combat succeeded to the spirit\n",
      "of organization, bitterness to cordiality, hatred of one another to the\n",
      "benevolence of the founder towards all; the threads which M. Madeleine\n",
      "had set were tangled and broken, the methods were adulterated, the\n",

      "Before proceeding further, it will be to the purpose to narrate in some\n",
      "detail, a singular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch,\n",
      "in Montfermeil, and which is not lacking in coincidence with certain\n",
      "conjectures of the indictment.\n",
      "\n",
      "There exists in the region of Montfermeil a very ancient superstition,\n",
      "which is all the more curious and all the more precious, because a\n",
      "popular superstition in the vicinity of Paris is like an aloe in\n",
      "Siberia. We are among those who respect everything which is in the\n",
      "nature of a rare plant. Here, then, is the superstition of Montfermeil:\n",
      "it is thought that the devil, from time immemorial, has selected the\n",
      "forest as a hiding-place for his treasures. Goodwives affirm that it is\n",
      "no rarity to encounter at nightfall, in secluded nooks of the forest, a\n",
      "black man with the air of a carter or a wood-chopper, wearing wooden\n",
      "shoes, clad in trousers and a blouse of linen, and recognizable by the\n",
      "fact, that, instead of a cap or hat, he has two immense horns on his\n",
      "head. This ought, in fact, to render him recognizable. This man is\n",
      "habitually engaged in digging a hole. There are three ways of profiting\n",
      "by such an encounter. The first is to approach the man and speak to\n",
      "him. Then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant, that he appears\n",
      "black because it is nightfall; that he is not digging any hole\n",
      "whatever, but is cutting grass for his cows, and that what had been\n",
      "taken for horns is nothing but a dung-fork which he is carrying on his\n",
      "back, and whose teeth, thanks to the perspective of evening, seemed to\n",
      "spring from his head. The man returns home and dies within the week.\n",
      "The second way is to watch him, to wait until he has dug his hole,\n",
      "until he has filled it and has gone away; then to run with great speed\n",
      "to the trench, to open it once more and to seize the “treasure” which\n",
      "the black man has necessarily placed there. In this case one dies\n",
      "within the month. Finally, the last method is not to speak to the black\n",
      "man, not to look at him, and to flee at the best speed of one’s legs.\n",
      "One then dies within the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "As all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences,\n",
      "the second, which at all events, presents some advantages, among others\n",
      "that of possessing a treasure, if only for a month, is the one most\n",
      "generally adopted. So bold men, who are tempted by every chance, have\n",
      "quite frequently, as we are assured, opened the holes excavated by the\n",
      "black man, and tried to rob the devil. The success of the operation\n",
      "appears to be but moderate. At least, if the tradition is to be\n",
      "believed, and in particular the two enigmatical lines in barbarous\n",
      "Latin, which an evil Norman monk, a bit of a sorcerer, named Tryphon\n",
      "has left on this subject. This Tryphon is buried at the Abbey of\n",
      "Saint-Georges de Bocherville, near Rouen, and toads spawn on his grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, enormous efforts are made. Such trenches are ordinarily\n",
      "extremely deep; a man sweats, digs, toils all night—for it must be done\n",
      "at night; he wets his shirt, burns out his candle, breaks his mattock,\n",
      "and when he arrives at the bottom of the hole, when he lays his hand on\n",
      "the “treasure,” what does he find? What is the devil’s treasure? A sou,\n",
      "sometimes a crown-piece, a stone, a skeleton, a bleeding body,\n",
      "sometimes a spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper in a\n",
      "portfolio, sometimes nothing. This is what Tryphon’s verses seem to\n",
      "announce to the indiscreet and curious:—\n",

      "It seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder-horn with\n",
      "bullets, sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn, which has\n",
      "evidently served the devil. Tryphon does not record these two finds,\n",
      "since Tryphon lived in the twelfth century, and since the devil does\n",
      "not appear to have had the wit to invent powder before Roger Bacon’s\n",
      "time, and cards before the time of Charles VI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, if one plays at cards, one is sure to lose all that one\n",
      "possesses! and as for the powder in the horn, it possesses the property\n",
      "of making your gun burst in your face.\n",

      "inhabitants of the district as too respectful, too humble, too prompt\n",
      "in removing his cap to every one, and trembling and smiling in the\n",
      "presence of the gendarmes,—probably affiliated to robber bands, they\n",

      "This is what people thought they had noticed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "Of late, Boulatruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone-breaking\n",
      "and care of the road at a very early hour, and to betaking himself to\n",
      "the forest with his pickaxe. He was encountered towards evening in the\n",
      "most deserted clearings, in the wildest thickets; and he had the\n",
      "appearance of being in search of something, and sometimes he was\n",
      "digging holes. The goodwives who passed took him at first for\n",
      "Beelzebub; then they recognized Boulatruelle, and were not in the least\n",
      "reassured thereby. These encounters seemed to cause Boulatruelle a\n",
      "lively displeasure. It was evident that he sought to hide, and that\n",
      "there was some mystery in what he was doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was said in the village: “It is clear that the devil has appeared.\n",
      "Boulatruelle has seen him, and is on the search. In sooth, he is\n",
      "cunning enough to pocket Lucifer’s hoard.”\n",

      "\n",
      "In the meantime, Boulatruelle’s manœuvres in the forest ceased; and he\n",

      "something else.\n",

      "Some persons, however, were still curious, surmising that in all this\n",
      "there was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends, but some fine\n",
      "windfall of a more serious and palpable sort than the devil’s\n",
      "bank-bills, and that the road-mender had half discovered the secret.\n",
      "The most “puzzled” were the schoolmaster and Thénardier, the proprietor\n",
      "of the tavern, who was everybody’s friend, and had not disdained to\n",
      "ally himself with Boulatruelle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He has been in the galleys,” said Thénardier. “Eh! Good God! no one\n",

      "\n",
      "One evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law\n",
      "would have instituted an inquiry as to what Boulatruelle did in the\n",
      "forest, and that the latter would have been forced to speak, and that\n",
      "he would have been put to the torture in case of need, and that\n",
      "Boulatruelle would not have resisted the water test, for example. “Let\n",
      "us put him to the wine test,” said Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "They made an effort, and got the old road-mender to drinking.\n",
      "Boulatruelle drank an enormous amount, but said very little. He\n",
      "combined with admirable art, and in masterly proportions, the thirst of\n",
      "a gormandizer with the discretion of a judge. Nevertheless, by dint of\n",
      "returning to the charge and of comparing and putting together the few\n",
      "obscure words which he did allow to escape him, this is what Thénardier\n",
      "and the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out:—\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, when Boulatruelle was on his way to his work, at daybreak,\n",
      "he had been surprised to see, at a nook of the forest in the\n",
      "underbrush, a shovel and a pickaxe, _concealed, as one might say_.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and\n",
      "pick of Father Six-Fours, the water-carrier, and would have thought no\n",
      "more about it. But, on the evening of that day, he saw, without being\n",
      "seen himself, as he was hidden by a large tree, “a person who did not\n",
      "belong in those parts, and whom he, Boulatruelle, knew well,” directing\n",
      "his steps towards the densest part of the wood. Translation by\n",
      "Thénardier: _A comrade of the galleys_. Boulatruelle obstinately\n",
      "refused to reveal his name. This person carried a package—something\n",
      "square, like a large box or a small trunk. Surprise on the part of\n",
      "Boulatruelle. However, it was only after the expiration of seven or\n",
      "eight minutes that the idea of following that “person” had occurred to\n",
      "him. But it was too late; the person was already in the thicket, night\n",
      "had descended, and Boulatruelle had not been able to catch up with him.\n",
      "Then he had adopted the course of watching for him at the edge of the\n",
      "woods. “It was moonlight.” Two or three hours later, Boulatruelle had\n",
      "seen this person emerge from the brushwood, carrying no longer the\n",
      "coffer, but a shovel and pick. Boulatruelle had allowed the person to\n",
      "pass, and had not dreamed of accosting him, because he said to himself\n",
      "that the other man was three times as strong as he was, and armed with\n",
      "a pickaxe, and that he would probably knock him over the head on\n",
      "recognizing him, and on perceiving that he was recognized. Touching\n",
      "effusion of two old comrades on meeting again. But the shovel and pick\n",
      "had served as a ray of light to Boulatruelle; he had hastened to the\n",
      "thicket in the morning, and had found neither shovel nor pick. From\n",
      "this he had drawn the inference that this person, once in the forest,\n",
      "had dug a hole with his pick, buried the coffer, and reclosed the hole\n",
      "with his shovel. Now, the coffer was too small to contain a body;\n",
      "therefore it contained money. Hence his researches. Boulatruelle had\n",
      "explored, sounded, searched the entire forest and the thicket, and had\n",
      "dug wherever the earth appeared to him to have been recently turned up.\n",
      "In vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had “ferreted out” nothing. No one in Montfermeil thought any more\n",

      "had dashed into the rigging: no one noticed, at the instant, with what\n",
      "ease that chain had been broken; it was only later on that the incident\n",
      "was recalled.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a twinkling he was on the yard; he paused for a few seconds and\n",
      "appeared to be measuring it with his eye; these seconds, during which\n",
      "the breeze swayed the topman at the extremity of a thread, seemed\n",
      "centuries to those who were looking on. At last, the convict raised his\n",
      "eyes to heaven and advanced a step: the crowd drew a long breath. He\n",
      "was seen to run out along the yard: on arriving at the point, he\n",
      "fastened the rope which he had brought to it, and allowed the other end\n",
      "to hang down, then he began to descend the rope, hand over hand, and\n",
      "then,—and the anguish was indescribable,—instead of one man suspended\n",
      "over the gulf, there were two.\n",
      "\n",
      "One would have said it was a spider coming to seize a fly, only here\n",
      "the spider brought life, not death. Ten thousand glances were fastened\n",
      "on this group; not a cry, not a word; the same tremor contracted every\n",
      "brow; all mouths held their breath as though they feared to add the\n",
      "slightest puff to the wind which was swaying the two unfortunate men.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, the convict had succeeded in lowering himself to a\n",
      "position near the sailor. It was high time; one minute more, and the\n",
      "exhausted and despairing man would have allowed himself to fall into\n",
      "the abyss. The convict had moored him securely with the cord to which\n",
      "he clung with one hand, while he was working with the other. At last,\n",
      "he was seen to climb back on the yard, and to drag the sailor up after\n",
      "him; he held him there a moment to allow him to recover his strength,\n",
      "then he grasped him in his arms and carried him, walking on the yard\n",
      "himself to the cap, and from there to the main-top, where he left him\n",
      "in the hands of his comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment the crowd broke into applause: old convict-sergeants\n",
      "among them wept, and women embraced each other on the quay, and all\n",
      "voices were heard to cry with a sort of tender rage, “Pardon for that\n",
      "man!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He, in the meantime, had immediately begun to make his descent to\n",
      "rejoin his detachment. In order to reach them the more speedily, he\n",
      "dropped into the rigging, and ran along one of the lower yards; all\n",
      "eyes were following him. At a certain moment fear assailed them;\n",
      "whether it was that he was fatigued, or that his head turned, they\n",
      "thought they saw him hesitate and stagger. All at once the crowd\n",
      "uttered a loud shout: the convict had fallen into the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fall was perilous. The frigate _Algésiras_ was anchored alongside\n",
      "the _Orion_, and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels:\n",
      "it was to be feared that he would slip under one or the other of them.\n",
      "Four men flung themselves hastily into a boat; the crowd cheered them\n",
      "on; anxiety again took possession of all souls; the man had not risen\n",
      "to the surface; he had disappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple,\n",
      "as though he had fallen into a cask of oil: they sounded, they dived.\n",
      "In vain. The search was continued until the evening: they did not even\n",
      "find the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the following day the Toulon newspaper printed these lines:—\n",

      "board of the _Orion_, on his return from rendering assistance to a\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Montfermeil is situated between Livry and Chelles, on the southern edge\n",
      "of that lofty table-land which separates the Ourcq from the Marne. At\n",
      "the present day it is a tolerably large town, ornamented all the year\n",
      "through with plaster villas, and on Sundays with beaming bourgeois. In\n",
      "1823 there were at Montfermeil neither so many white houses nor so many\n",
      "well-satisfied citizens: it was only a village in the forest. Some\n",
      "pleasure-houses of the last century were to be met with there, to be\n",
      "sure, which were recognizable by their grand air, their balconies in\n",
      "twisted iron, and their long windows, whose tiny panes cast all sorts\n",
      "of varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters; but\n",
      "Montfermeil was nonetheless a village. Retired cloth-merchants and\n",
      "rusticating attorneys had not discovered it as yet; it was a peaceful\n",
      "and charming place, which was not on the road to anywhere: there people\n",
      "lived, and cheaply, that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous and\n",
      "so easy; only, water was rare there, on account of the elevation of the\n",
      "plateau.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance; the end of\n",
      "the village towards Gagny drew its water from the magnificent ponds\n",
      "which exist in the woods there. The other end, which surrounds the\n",
      "church and which lies in the direction of Chelles, found drinking-water\n",
      "only at a little spring half-way down the slope, near the road to\n",
      "Chelles, about a quarter of an hour from Montfermeil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water. The\n",
      "large houses, the aristocracy, of which the Thénardier tavern formed a\n",
      "part, paid half a farthing a bucketful to a man who made a business of\n",
      "it, and who earned about eight sous a day in his enterprise of\n",
      "supplying Montfermeil with water; but this good man only worked until\n",
      "seven o’clock in the evening in summer, and five in winter; and night\n",
      "once come and the shutters on the ground floor once closed, he who had\n",
      "no water to drink went to fetch it for himself or did without it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader has\n",
      "probably not forgotten,—little Cosette. It will be remembered that\n",
      "Cosette was useful to the Thénardiers in two ways: they made the mother\n",
      "pay them, and they made the child serve them. So when the mother ceased\n",
      "to pay altogether, the reason for which we have read in preceding\n",
      "chapters, the Thénardiers kept Cosette. She took the place of a servant\n",
      "in their house. In this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water when\n",
      "it was required. So the child, who was greatly terrified at the idea of\n",
      "going to the spring at night, took great care that water should never\n",
      "be lacking in the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Christmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfermeil.\n",
      "The beginning of the winter had been mild; there had been neither snow\n",
      "nor frost up to that time. Some mountebanks from Paris had obtained\n",
      "permission of the mayor to erect their booths in the principal street\n",
      "of the village, and a band of itinerant merchants, under protection of\n",
      "the same tolerance, had constructed their stalls on the Church Square,\n",
      "and even extended them into Boulanger Alley, where, as the reader will\n",
      "perhaps remember, the Thénardiers’ hostelry was situated. These people\n",
      "filled the inns and drinking-shops, and communicated to that tranquil\n",
      "little district a noisy and joyous life. In order to play the part of a\n",
      "faithful historian, we ought even to add that, among the curiosities\n",
      "displayed in the square, there was a menagerie, in which frightful\n",
      "clowns, clad in rags and coming no one knew whence, exhibited to the\n",
      "peasants of Montfermeil in 1823 one of those horrible Brazilian\n",
      "vultures, such as our Royal Museum did not possess until 1845, and\n",
      "which have a tricolored cockade for an eye. I believe that naturalists\n",
      "call this bird Caracara Polyborus; it belongs to the order of the\n",
      "Apicides, and to the family of the vultures. Some good old Bonapartist\n",
      "soldiers, who had retired to the village, went to see this creature\n",
      "with great devotion. The mountebanks gave out that the tricolored\n",
      "cockade was a unique phenomenon made by God expressly for their\n",
      "menagerie.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Christmas eve itself, a number of men, carters, and peddlers, were\n",
      "seated at table, drinking and smoking around four or five candles in\n",
      "the public room of Thénardier’s hostelry. This room resembled all\n",
      "drinking-shop rooms,—tables, pewter jugs, bottles, drinkers, smokers;\n",
      "but little light and a great deal of noise. The date of the year 1823\n",
      "was indicated, nevertheless, by two objects which were then fashionable\n",
      "in the bourgeois class: to wit, a kaleidoscope and a lamp of ribbed\n",
      "tin. The female Thénardier was attending to the supper, which was\n",
      "roasting in front of a clear fire; her husband was drinking with his\n",
      "customers and talking politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides political conversations which had for their principal subjects\n",
      "the Spanish war and M. le Duc d’Angoulême, strictly local parentheses,\n",
      "like the following, were audible amid the uproar:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“About Nanterre and Suresnes the vines have flourished greatly. When\n",
      "ten pieces were reckoned on there have been twelve. They have yielded a\n",
      "great deal of juice under the press.” “But the grapes cannot be ripe?”\n",
      "“In those parts the grapes should not be ripe; the wine turns oily as\n",
      "soon as spring comes.” “Then it is very thin wine?” “There are wines\n",
      "poorer even than these. The grapes must be gathered while green.” Etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or a miller would call out:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are we responsible for what is in the sacks? We find in them a\n",
      "quantity of small seed which we cannot sift out, and which we are\n",
      "obliged to send through the mill-stones; there are tares, fennel,\n",
      "vetches, hempseed, fox-tail, and a host of other weeds, not to mention\n",
      "pebbles, which abound in certain wheat, especially in Breton wheat. I\n",
      "am not fond of grinding Breton wheat, any more than long-sawyers like\n",
      "to saw beams with nails in them. You can judge of the bad dust that\n",
      "makes in grinding. And then people complain of the flour. They are in\n",
      "the wrong. The flour is no fault of ours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In a space between two windows a mower, who was seated at table with a\n",
      "landed proprietor who was fixing on a price for some meadow work to be\n",
      "performed in the spring, was saying:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“It does no harm to have the grass wet. It cuts better. Dew is a good\n",
      "thing, sir. It makes no difference with that grass. Your grass is young\n",
      "and very hard to cut still. It’s terribly tender. It yields before the\n",
      "iron.” Etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette was in her usual place, seated on the cross-bar of the kitchen\n",
      "table near the chimney. She was in rags; her bare feet were thrust into\n",
      "wooden shoes, and by the firelight she was engaged in knitting woollen\n",
      "stockings destined for the young Thénardiers. A very young kitten was\n",
      "playing about among the chairs. Laughter and chatter were audible in\n",
      "the adjoining room, from two fresh children’s voices: it was Éponine\n",
      "and Azelma.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the chimney-corner a cat-o’-nine-tails was hanging on a nail.\n",
      "\n",
      "At intervals the cry of a very young child, which was somewhere in the\n",
      "house, rang through the noise of the dram-shop. It was a little boy who\n",
      "had been born to the Thénardiers during one of the preceding\n",
      "winters,—“she did not know why,” she said, “the result of the\n",
      "cold,”—and who was a little more than three years old. The mother had\n",
      "nursed him, but she did not love him. When the persistent clamor of the\n",
      "brat became too annoying, “Your son is squalling,” Thénardier would\n",
      "say; “do go and see what he wants.” “Bah!” the mother would reply, “he\n",
      "bothers me.” And the neglected child continued to shriek in the dark.\n",

      "So far in this book the Thénardiers have been viewed only in profile;\n",
      "the moment has arrived for making the circuit of this couple, and\n",
      "considering it under all its aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday; Madame Thénardier was\n",
      "approaching her forties, which is equivalent to fifty in a woman; so\n",
      "that there existed a balance of age between husband and wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this\n",
      "Thénardier woman, ever since her first appearance,—tall, blond, red,\n",
      "fat, angular, square, enormous, and agile; she belonged, as we have\n",
      "said, to the race of those colossal wild women, who contort themselves\n",
      "at fairs with paving-stones hanging from their hair. She did everything\n",
      "about the house,—made the beds, did the washing, the cooking, and\n",
      "everything else. Cosette was her only servant; a mouse in the service\n",
      "of an elephant. Everything trembled at the sound of her voice,—window\n",
      "panes, furniture, and people. Her big face, dotted with red blotches,\n",
      "presented the appearance of a skimmer. She had a beard. She was an\n",
      "ideal market-porter dressed in woman’s clothes. She swore splendidly;\n",
      "she boasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist.\n",
      "Except for the romances which she had read, and which made the affected\n",
      "lady peep through the ogress at times, in a very queer way, the idea\n",
      "would never have occurred to any one to say of her, “That is a woman.”\n",
      "This Thénardier female was like the product of a wench engrafted on a\n",
      "fishwife. When one heard her speak, one said, “That is a gendarme”;\n",
      "when one saw her drink, one said, “That is a carter”; when one saw her\n",
      "handle Cosette, one said, “That is the hangman.” One of her teeth\n",
      "projected when her face was in repose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier was a small, thin, pale, angular, bony, feeble man, who had\n",
      "a sickly air and who was wonderfully healthy. His cunning began here;\n",
      "he smiled habitually, by way of precaution, and was almost polite to\n",
      "everybody, even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing. He\n",
      "had the glance of a pole-cat and the bearing of a man of letters. He\n",
      "greatly resembled the portraits of the Abbé Delille. His coquetry\n",
      "consisted in drinking with the carters. No one had ever succeeded in\n",
      "rendering him drunk. He smoked a big pipe. He wore a blouse, and under\n",
      "his blouse an old black coat. He made pretensions to literature and to\n",
      "materialism. There were certain names which he often pronounced to\n",
      "support whatever things he might be saying,—Voltaire, Raynal, Parny,\n",
      "and, singularly enough, Saint Augustine. He declared that he had “a\n",
      "system.” In addition, he was a great swindler. A _filousophe_\n",
      "[philosophe], a scientific thief. The species does exist. It will be\n",
      "remembered that he pretended to have served in the army; he was in the\n",
      "habit of relating with exuberance, how, being a sergeant in the 6th or\n",
      "the 9th light something or other, at Waterloo, he had alone, and in the\n",
      "presence of a squadron of death-dealing hussars, covered with his body\n",
      "and saved from death, in the midst of the grape-shot, “a general, who\n",
      "had been dangerously wounded.” Thence arose for his wall the flaring\n",
      "sign, and for his inn the name which it bore in the neighborhood, of\n",
      "“the cabaret of the Sergeant of Waterloo.” He was a liberal, a classic,\n",
      "and a Bonapartist. He had subscribed for the Champ d’Asile. It was said\n",
      "in the village that he had studied for the priesthood.\n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that he had simply studied in Holland for an inn-keeper.\n",
      "This rascal of composite order was, in all probability, some Fleming\n",
      "from Lille, in Flanders, a Frenchman in Paris, a Belgian at Brussels,\n",
      "being comfortably astride of both frontiers. As for his prowess at\n",
      "Waterloo, the reader is already acquainted with that. It will be\n",
      "perceived that he exaggerated it a trifle. Ebb and flow, wandering,\n",
      "adventure, was the leven of his existence; a tattered conscience\n",
      "entails a fragmentary life, and, apparently at the stormy epoch of June\n",
      "18, 1815, Thénardier belonged to that variety of marauding sutlers of\n",
      "which we have spoken, beating about the country, selling to some,\n",
      "stealing from others, and travelling like a family man, with wife and\n",
      "children, in a rickety cart, in the rear of troops on the march, with\n",
      "an instinct for always attaching himself to the victorious army. This\n",
      "campaign ended, and having, as he said, “some quibus,” he had come to\n",
      "Montfermeil and set up an inn there.\n",
      "\n",
      "This _quibus_, composed of purses and watches, of gold rings and silver\n",
      "crosses, gathered in harvest-time in furrows sown with corpses, did not\n",
      "amount to a large total, and did not carry this sutler turned\n",
      "eating-house-keeper very far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his gestures\n",
      "which, accompanied by an oath, recalls the barracks, and by a sign of\n",
      "the cross, the seminary. He was a fine talker. He allowed it to be\n",
      "thought that he was an educated man. Nevertheless, the schoolmaster had\n",
      "noticed that he pronounced improperly.12\n",
      "\n",
      "He composed the travellers’ tariff card in a superior manner, but\n",
      "practised eyes sometimes spied out orthographical errors in it.\n",
      "Thénardier was cunning, greedy, slothful, and clever. He did not\n",
      "disdain his servants, which caused his wife to dispense with them. This\n",
      "giantess was jealous. It seemed to her that that thin and yellow little\n",
      "man must be an object coveted by all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier, who was, above all, an astute and well-balanced man, was a\n",
      "scamp of a temperate sort. This is the worst species; hypocrisy enters\n",
      "into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not that Thénardier was not, on occasion, capable of wrath to\n",
      "quite the same degree as his wife; but this was very rare, and at such\n",
      "times, since he was enraged with the human race in general, as he bore\n",
      "within him a deep furnace of hatred. And since he was one of those\n",
      "people who are continually avenging their wrongs, who accuse everything\n",
      "that passes before them of everything which has befallen them, and who\n",
      "are always ready to cast upon the first person who comes to hand, as a\n",
      "legitimate grievance, the sum total of the deceptions, the\n",
      "bankruptcies, and the calamities of their lives,—when all this leaven\n",
      "was stirred up in him and boiled forth from his mouth and eyes, he was\n",
      "terrible. Woe to the person who came under his wrath at such a time!\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to his other qualities, Thénardier was attentive and\n",
      "penetrating, silent or talkative, according to circumstances, and\n",
      "always highly intelligent. He had something of the look of sailors, who\n",
      "are accustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses.\n",
      "Thénardier was a statesman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every newcomer who entered the tavern said, on catching sight of Madame\n",
      "Thénardier, “There is the master of the house.” A mistake. She was not\n",
      "even the mistress. The husband was both master and mistress. She\n",
      "worked; he created. He directed everything by a sort of invisible and\n",
      "constant magnetic action. A word was sufficient for him, sometimes a\n",
      "sign; the mastodon obeyed. Thénardier was a sort of special and\n",
      "sovereign being in Madame Thénardier’s eyes, though she did not\n",
      "thoroughly realize it. She was possessed of virtues after her own kind;\n",
      "if she had ever had a disagreement as to any detail with “Monsieur\n",
      "Thénardier,”—which was an inadmissible hypothesis, by the way,—she\n",
      "would not have blamed her husband in public on any subject whatever.\n",
      "She would never have committed “before strangers” that mistake so often\n",
      "committed by women, and which is called in parliamentary language,\n",
      "“exposing the crown.” Although their concord had only evil as its\n",
      "result, there was contemplation in Madame Thénardier’s submission to\n",
      "her husband. That mountain of noise and of flesh moved under the little\n",
      "finger of that frail despot. Viewed on its dwarfed and grotesque side,\n",
      "this was that grand and universal thing, the adoration of mind by\n",
      "matter; for certain ugly features have a cause in the very depths of\n",
      "eternal beauty. There was an unknown quantity about Thénardier; hence\n",
      "the absolute empire of the man over that woman. At certain moments she\n",
      "beheld him like a lighted candle; at others she felt him like a claw.\n",
      "\n",
      "This woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except her\n",
      "children, and who did not fear any one except her husband. She was a\n",
      "mother because she was mammiferous. But her maternity stopped short\n",
      "with her daughters, and, as we shall see, did not extend to boys. The\n",
      "man had but one thought,—how to enrich himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not succeed in this. A theatre worthy of this great talent was\n",
      "lacking. Thénardier was ruining himself at Montfermeil, if ruin is\n",
      "possible to zero; in Switzerland or in the Pyrenees this penniless\n",
      "scamp would have become a millionaire; but an inn-keeper must browse\n",
      "where fate has hitched him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will be understood that the word _inn-keeper_ is here employed in a\n",
      "restricted sense, and does not extend to an entire class.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this same year, 1823, Thénardier was burdened with about fifteen\n",
      "hundred francs’ worth of petty debts, and this rendered him anxious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny in this case,\n",
      "Thénardier was one of those men who understand best, with the most\n",
      "profundity and in the most modern fashion, that thing which is a virtue\n",
      "among barbarous peoples and an object of merchandise among civilized\n",
      "peoples,—hospitality. Besides, he was an admirable poacher, and quoted\n",
      "for his skill in shooting. He had a certain cold and tranquil laugh,\n",
      "which was particularly dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "His theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes.\n",
      "He had professional aphorisms, which he inserted into his wife’s mind.\n",
      "“The duty of the inn-keeper,” he said to her one day, violently, and in\n",
      "a low voice, “is to sell to the first comer, stews, repose, light,\n",
      "fire, dirty sheets, a servant, lice, and a smile; to stop passers-by,\n",
      "to empty small purses, and to honestly lighten heavy ones; to shelter\n",
      "travelling families respectfully: to shave the man, to pluck the woman,\n",
      "to pick the child clean; to quote the window open, the window shut, the\n",
      "chimney-corner, the armchair, the chair, the ottoman, the stool, the\n",
      "feather-bed, the mattress and the truss of straw; to know how much the\n",
      "shadow uses up the mirror, and to put a price on it; and, by five\n",
      "hundred thousand devils, to make the traveller pay for everything, even\n",
      "for the flies which his dog eats!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This man and this woman were ruse and rage wedded—a hideous and\n",
      "terrible team.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the husband pondered and combined, Madame Thénardier thought not\n",
      "of absent creditors, took no heed of yesterday nor of to-morrow, and\n",
      "lived in a fit of anger, all in a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were these two beings. Cosette was between them, subjected to\n",
      "their double pressure, like a creature who is at the same time being\n",
      "ground up in a mill and pulled to pieces with pincers. The man and the\n",
      "woman each had a different method: Cosette was overwhelmed with\n",
      "blows—this was the woman’s; she went barefooted in winter—that was the\n",
      "man’s doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette ran upstairs and down, washed, swept, rubbed, dusted, ran,\n",
      "fluttered about, panted, moved heavy articles, and weak as she was, did\n",
      "the coarse work. There was no mercy for her; a fierce mistress and\n",
      "venomous master. The Thénardier hostelry was like a spider’s web, in\n",
      "which Cosette had been caught, and where she lay trembling. The ideal\n",
      "of oppression was realized by this sinister household. It was something\n",
      "like the fly serving the spiders.\n",

      "What takes place within these souls when they have but just quitted\n",

      "\n",
      "Four new travellers had arrived.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette was meditating sadly; for, although she was only eight years\n",
      "old, she had already suffered so much that she reflected with the\n",
      "lugubrious air of an old woman. Her eye was black in consequence of a\n",
      "blow from Madame Thénardier’s fist, which caused the latter to remark\n",
      "from time to time, “How ugly she is with her fist-blow on her eye!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette was thinking that it was dark, very dark, that the pitchers and\n",
      "caraffes in the chambers of the travellers who had arrived must have\n",
      "been filled and that there was no more water in the cistern.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was somewhat reassured because no one in the Thénardier\n",
      "establishment drank much water. Thirsty people were never lacking\n",
      "there; but their thirst was of the sort which applies to the jug rather\n",
      "than to the pitcher. Any one who had asked for a glass of water among\n",
      "all those glasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all these\n",
      "men. But there came a moment when the child trembled; Madame Thénardier\n",
      "raised the cover of a stew-pan which was boiling on the stove, then\n",
      "seized a glass and briskly approached the cistern. She turned the\n",
      "faucet; the child had raised her head and was following all the woman’s\n",
      "movements. A thin stream of water trickled from the faucet, and half\n",
      "filled the glass. “Well,” said she, “there is no more water!” A\n",
      "momentary silence ensued. The child did not breathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bah!” resumed Madame Thénardier, examining the half-filled glass,\n",
      "“this will be enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette applied herself to her work once more, but for a quarter of an\n",
      "hour she felt her heart leaping in her bosom like a big snow-flake.\n",
      "\n",
      "She counted the minutes that passed in this manner, and wished it were\n",
      "the next morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "From time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street, and\n",
      "exclaimed, “It’s as black as an oven!” or, “One must needs be a cat to\n",
      "go about the streets without a lantern at this hour!” And Cosette\n",
      "trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once one of the pedlers who lodged in the hostelry entered, and\n",
      "said in a harsh voice:—\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Cosette had emerged from under the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes, sir!” said she, “the horse has had a drink; he drank out of a\n",
      "bucket, a whole bucketful, and it was I who took the water to him, and\n",
      "I spoke to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not true; Cosette lied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s a brat as big as my fist who tells lies as big as the house,”\n",
      "exclaimed the pedler. “I tell you that he has not been watered, you\n",
      "little jade! He has a way of blowing when he has had no water, which I\n",
      "know well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette persisted, and added in a voice rendered hoarse with anguish,\n",
      "and which was hardly audible:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“And he drank heartily.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come,” said the pedler, in a rage, “this won’t do at all, let my horse\n",
      "be watered, and let that be the end of it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette crept under the table again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In truth, that is fair!” said Madame Thénardier, “if the beast has not\n",
      "been watered, it must be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then glancing about her:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, now! Where’s that other beast?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She bent down and discovered Cosette cowering at the other end of the\n",
      "table, almost under the drinkers’ feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you coming?” shrieked Madame Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette crawled out of the sort of hole in which she had hidden\n",
      "herself. The Thénardier resumed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mademoiselle Dog-lack-name, go and water that horse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Madame,” said Cosette, feebly, “there is no water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Thénardier threw the street door wide open:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, go and get some, then!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette dropped her head, and went for an empty bucket which stood near\n",
      "the chimney-corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "This bucket was bigger than she was, and the child could have set down\n",
      "in it at her ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Thénardier returned to her stove, and tasted what was in the\n",
      "stewpan, with a wooden spoon, grumbling the while:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s plenty in the spring. There never was such a malicious\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Cosette had a little pocket on one side of her apron; she took the coin\n",
      "without saying a word, and put it in that pocket.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The line of open-air booths starting at the church, extended, as the\n",
      "reader will remember, as far as the hostelry of the Thénardiers. These\n",
      "booths were all illuminated, because the citizens would soon pass on\n",
      "their way to the midnight mass, with candles burning in paper funnels,\n",
      "which, as the schoolmaster, then seated at the table at the\n",
      "Thénardiers’ observed, produced “a magical effect.” In compensation,\n",
      "not a star was visible in the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last of these stalls, established precisely opposite the\n",
      "Thénardiers’ door, was a toy-shop all glittering with tinsel, glass,\n",
      "and magnificent objects of tin. In the first row, and far forwards, the\n",
      "merchant had placed on a background of white napkins, an immense doll,\n",
      "nearly two feet high, who was dressed in a robe of pink crepe, with\n",
      "gold wheat-ears on her head, which had real hair and enamel eyes. All\n",
      "that day, this marvel had been displayed to the wonderment of all\n",
      "passers-by under ten years of age, without a mother being found in\n",
      "Montfermeil sufficiently rich or sufficiently extravagant to give it to\n",
      "her child. Éponine and Azelma had passed hours in contemplating it, and\n",
      "Cosette herself had ventured to cast a glance at it, on the sly, it is\n",
      "true.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment when Cosette emerged, bucket in hand, melancholy and\n",
      "overcome as she was, she could not refrain from lifting her eyes to\n",
      "that wonderful doll, towards _the lady_, as she called it. The poor\n",
      "child paused in amazement. She had not yet beheld that doll close to.\n",
      "The whole shop seemed a palace to her: the doll was not a doll; it was\n",
      "a vision. It was joy, splendor, riches, happiness, which appeared in a\n",
      "sort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly\n",
      "engulfed in gloomy and chilly misery. With the sad and innocent\n",
      "sagacity of childhood, Cosette measured the abyss which separated her\n",
      "from that doll. She said to herself that one must be a queen, or at\n",
      "least a princess, to have a “thing” like that. She gazed at that\n",
      "beautiful pink dress, that beautiful smooth hair, and she thought, “How\n",
      "happy that doll must be!” She could not take her eyes from that\n",
      "fantastic stall. The more she looked, the more dazzled she grew. She\n",
      "thought she was gazing at paradise. There were other dolls behind the\n",
      "large one, which seemed to her to be fairies and genii. The merchant,\n",
      "who was pacing back and forth in front of his shop, produced on her\n",
      "somewhat the effect of being the Eternal Father.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this adoration she forgot everything, even the errand with which she\n",
      "was charged.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once the Thénardier’s coarse voice recalled her to reality:\n",
      "“What, you silly jade! you have not gone? Wait! I’ll give it to you! I\n",
      "want to know what you are doing there! Get along, you little monster!”\n",

      "\n",
      "As the Thénardier hostelry was in that part of the village which is\n",
      "near the church, it was to the spring in the forest in the direction of\n",
      "Chelles that Cosette was obliged to go for her water.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not glance at the display of a single other merchant. So long\n",
      "as she was in Boulanger Lane and in the neighborhood of the church, the\n",
      "lighted stalls illuminated the road; but soon the last light from the\n",
      "last stall vanished. The poor child found herself in the dark. She\n",
      "plunged into it. Only, as a certain emotion overcame her, she made as\n",
      "much motion as possible with the handle of the bucket as she walked\n",
      "along. This made a noise which afforded her company.\n",
      "\n",
      "The further she went, the denser the darkness became. There was no one\n",
      "in the streets. However, she did encounter a woman, who turned around\n",
      "on seeing her, and stood still, muttering between her teeth: “Where can\n",
      "that child be going? Is it a werewolf child?” Then the woman recognized\n",
      "Cosette. “Well,” said she, “it’s the Lark!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In this manner Cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and deserted\n",
      "streets which terminate in the village of Montfermeil on the side of\n",
      "Chelles. So long as she had the houses or even the walls only on both\n",
      "sides of her path, she proceeded with tolerable boldness. From time to\n",
      "time she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of a\n",
      "shutter—this was light and life; there were people there, and it\n",
      "reassured her. But in proportion as she advanced, her pace slackened\n",
      "mechanically, as it were. When she had passed the corner of the last\n",
      "house, Cosette paused. It had been hard to advance further than the\n",
      "last stall; it became impossible to proceed further than the last\n",
      "house. She set her bucket on the ground, thrust her hand into her hair,\n",
      "and began slowly to scratch her head,—a gesture peculiar to children\n",
      "when terrified and undecided what to do. It was no longer Montfermeil;\n",
      "it was the open fields. Black and desert space was before her. She\n",
      "gazed in despair at that darkness, where there was no longer any one,\n",
      "where there were beasts, where there were spectres, possibly. She took\n",
      "a good look, and heard the beasts walking on the grass, and she\n",
      "distinctly saw spectres moving in the trees. Then she seized her bucket\n",
      "again; fear had lent her audacity. “Bah!” said she; “I will tell him\n",
      "that there was no more water!” And she resolutely re-entered\n",
      "Montfermeil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly had she gone a hundred paces when she paused and began to\n",
      "scratch her head again. Now it was the Thénardier who appeared to her,\n",
      "with her hideous, hyena mouth, and wrath flashing in her eyes. The\n",
      "child cast a melancholy glance before her and behind her. What was she\n",
      "to do? What was to become of her? Where was she to go? In front of her\n",
      "was the spectre of the Thénardier; behind her all the phantoms of the\n",
      "night and of the forest. It was before the Thénardier that she\n",
      "recoiled. She resumed her path to the spring, and began to run. She\n",
      "emerged from the village, she entered the forest at a run, no longer\n",
      "looking at or listening to anything. She only paused in her course when\n",
      "her breath failed her; but she did not halt in her advance. She went\n",
      "straight before her in desperation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she ran she felt like crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nocturnal quivering of the forest surrounded her completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "She no longer thought, she no longer saw. The immensity of night was\n",
      "facing this tiny creature. On the one hand, all shadow; on the other,\n",
      "an atom.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only seven or eight minutes’ walk from the edge of the woods to\n",
      "the spring. Cosette knew the way, through having gone over it many\n",
      "times in daylight. Strange to say, she did not get lost. A remnant of\n",
      "instinct guided her vaguely. But she did not turn her eyes either to\n",
      "right or to left, for fear of seeing things in the branches and in the\n",
      "brushwood. In this manner she reached the spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a narrow, natural basin, hollowed out by the water in a clayey\n",
      "soil, about two feet deep, surrounded with moss and with those tall,\n",
      "crimped grasses which are called Henry IV.’s frills, and paved with\n",
      "several large stones. A brook ran out of it, with a tranquil little\n",
      "noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette did not take time to breathe. It was very dark, but she was in\n",
      "the habit of coming to this spring. She felt with her left hand in the\n",
      "dark for a young oak which leaned over the spring, and which usually\n",
      "served to support her, found one of its branches, clung to it, bent\n",
      "down, and plunged the bucket in the water. She was in a state of such\n",
      "violent excitement that her strength was trebled. While thus bent over,\n",
      "she did not notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself into\n",
      "the spring. The fifteen-sou piece fell into the water. Cosette neither\n",
      "saw nor heard it fall. She drew out the bucket nearly full, and set it\n",
      "on the grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "That done, she perceived that she was worn out with fatigue. She would\n",
      "have liked to set out again at once, but the effort required to fill\n",
      "the bucket had been such that she found it impossible to take a step.\n",
      "She was forced to sit down. She dropped on the grass, and remained\n",
      "crouching there.\n",
      "\n",
      "She shut her eyes; then she opened them again, without knowing why, but\n",
      "because she could not do otherwise. The agitated water in the bucket\n",
      "beside her was describing circles which resembled tin serpents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds, which were like\n",
      "masses of smoke. The tragic mask of shadow seemed to bend vaguely over\n",
      "the child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jupiter was setting in the depths.\n",
      "\n",
      "The child stared with bewildered eyes at this great star, with which\n",
      "she was unfamiliar, and which terrified her. The planet was, in fact,\n",
      "very near the horizon and was traversing a dense layer of mist which\n",
      "imparted to it a horrible ruddy hue. The mist, gloomily empurpled,\n",
      "magnified the star. One would have called it a luminous wound.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cold wind was blowing from the plain. The forest was dark, not a leaf\n",
      "was moving; there were none of the vague, fresh gleams of summertide.\n",
      "Great boughs uplifted themselves in frightful wise. Slender and\n",
      "misshapen bushes whistled in the clearings. The tall grasses undulated\n",
      "like eels under the north wind. The nettles seemed to twist long arms\n",
      "furnished with claws in search of prey. Some bits of dry heather,\n",
      "tossed by the breeze, flew rapidly by, and had the air of fleeing in\n",
      "terror before something which was coming after. On all sides there were\n",
      "lugubrious stretches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The darkness was bewildering. Man requires light. Whoever buries\n",
      "himself in the opposite of day feels his heart contract. When the eye\n",
      "sees black, the heart sees trouble. In an eclipse in the night, in the\n",
      "sooty opacity, there is anxiety even for the stoutest of hearts. No one\n",
      "walks alone in the forest at night without trembling. Shadows and\n",
      "trees—two formidable densities. A chimerical reality appears in the\n",
      "indistinct depths. The inconceivable is outlined a few paces distant\n",
      "from you with a spectral clearness. One beholds floating, either in\n",
      "space or in one’s own brain, one knows not what vague and intangible\n",
      "thing, like the dreams of sleeping flowers. There are fierce attitudes\n",
      "on the horizon. One inhales the effluvia of the great black void. One\n",
      "is afraid to glance behind him, yet desirous of doing so. The cavities\n",
      "of night, things grown haggard, taciturn profiles which vanish when one\n",
      "advances, obscure dishevelments, irritated tufts, livid pools, the\n",
      "lugubrious reflected in the funereal, the sepulchral immensity of\n",
      "silence, unknown but possible beings, bendings of mysterious branches,\n",
      "alarming torsos of trees, long handfuls of quivering plants,—against\n",
      "all this one has no protection. There is no hardihood which does not\n",
      "shudder and which does not feel the vicinity of anguish. One is\n",
      "conscious of something hideous, as though one’s soul were becoming\n",
      "amalgamated with the darkness. This penetration of the shadows is\n",
      "indescribably sinister in the case of a child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forests are apocalypses, and the beating of the wings of a tiny soul\n",
      "produces a sound of agony beneath their monstrous vault.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without understanding her sensations, Cosette was conscious that she\n",
      "was seized upon by that black enormity of nature; it was no longer\n",
      "terror alone which was gaining possession of her; it was something more\n",
      "terrible even than terror; she shivered. There are no words to express\n",
      "the strangeness of that shiver which chilled her to the very bottom of\n",
      "her heart; her eye grew wild; she thought she felt that she should not\n",
      "be able to refrain from returning there at the same hour on the morrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, by a sort of instinct, she began to count aloud, one, two, three,\n",
      "four, and so on up to ten, in order to escape from that singular state\n",
      "which she did not understand, but which terrified her, and, when she\n",
      "had finished, she began again; this restored her to a true perception\n",
      "of the things about her. Her hands, which she had wet in drawing the\n",
      "water, felt cold; she rose; her terror, a natural and unconquerable\n",
      "terror, had returned: she had but one thought now,—to flee at full\n",
      "speed through the forest, across the fields to the houses, to the\n",
      "windows, to the lighted candles. Her glance fell upon the water which\n",
      "stood before her; such was the fright which the Thénardier inspired in\n",
      "her, that she dared not flee without that bucket of water: she seized\n",
      "the handle with both hands; she could hardly lift the pail.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this manner she advanced a dozen paces, but the bucket was full; it\n",
      "was heavy; she was forced to set it on the ground once more. She took\n",
      "breath for an instant, then lifted the handle of the bucket again, and\n",
      "resumed her march, proceeding a little further this time, but again she\n",
      "was obliged to pause. After some seconds of repose she set out again.\n",
      "She walked bent forward, with drooping head, like an old woman; the\n",
      "weight of the bucket strained and stiffened her thin arms. The iron\n",
      "handle completed the benumbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands;\n",
      "she was forced to halt from time to time, and each time that she did\n",
      "so, the cold water which splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs.\n",
      "This took place in the depths of a forest, at night, in winter, far\n",
      "from all human sight; she was a child of eight: no one but God saw that\n",
      "sad thing at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "And her mother, no doubt, alas!\n",
      "\n",
      "For there are things that make the dead open their eyes in their\n",
      "graves.\n",
      "\n",
      "She panted with a sort of painful rattle; sobs contracted her throat,\n",
      "but she dared not weep, so afraid was she of the Thénardier, even at a\n",
      "distance: it was her custom to imagine the Thénardier always present.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, she could not make much headway in that manner, and she went\n",
      "on very slowly. In spite of diminishing the length of her stops, and of\n",
      "walking as long as possible between them, she reflected with anguish\n",
      "that it would take her more than an hour to return to Montfermeil in\n",
      "this manner, and that the Thénardier would beat her. This anguish was\n",
      "mingled with her terror at being alone in the woods at night; she was\n",
      "worn out with fatigue, and had not yet emerged from the forest. On\n",
      "arriving near an old chestnut-tree with which she was acquainted, made\n",
      "a last halt, longer than the rest, in order that she might get well\n",
      "rested; then she summoned up all her strength, picked up her bucket\n",
      "again, and courageously resumed her march, but the poor little\n",
      "desperate creature could not refrain from crying, “O my God! my God!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longer\n",
      "weighed anything at all: a hand, which seemed to her enormous, had just\n",
      "seized the handle, and lifted it vigorously. She raised her head. A\n",
      "large black form, straight and erect, was walking beside her through\n",
      "the darkness; it was a man who had come up behind her, and whose\n",
      "approach she had not heard. This man, without uttering a word, had\n",
      "seized the handle of the bucket which she was carrying.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the afternoon of that same Christmas Day, 1823, a man had walked for\n",
      "rather a long time in the most deserted part of the Boulevard de\n",
      "l’Hôpital in Paris. This man had the air of a person who is seeking\n",
      "lodgings, and he seemed to halt, by preference, at the most modest\n",
      "houses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg Saint-Marceau.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shall see further on that this man had, in fact, hired a chamber in\n",
      "that isolated quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "This man, in his attire, as in all his person, realized the type of\n",
      "what may be called the well-bred mendicant,—extreme wretchedness\n",
      "combined with extreme cleanliness. This is a very rare mixture which\n",
      "inspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels\n",
      "for the man who is very poor, and for the man who is very worthy. He\n",
      "wore a very old and very well brushed round hat; a coarse coat, worn\n",
      "perfectly threadbare, of an ochre yellow, a color that was not in the\n",
      "least eccentric at that epoch; a large waistcoat with pockets of a\n",
      "venerable cut; black breeches, worn gray at the knee, stockings of\n",
      "black worsted; and thick shoes with copper buckles. He would have been\n",
      "pronounced a preceptor in some good family, returned from the\n",
      "emigration. He would have been taken for more than sixty years of age,\n",
      "from his perfectly white hair, his wrinkled brow, his livid lips, and\n",
      "his countenance, where everything breathed depression and weariness of\n",
      "life. Judging from his firm tread, from the singular vigor which\n",
      "stamped all his movements, he would have hardly been thought fifty. The\n",
      "wrinkles on his brow were well placed, and would have disposed in his\n",
      "favor any one who observed him attentively. His lip contracted with a\n",
      "strange fold which seemed severe, and which was humble. There was in\n",
      "the depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity. In his\n",
      "left hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief; in his\n",
      "right he leaned on a sort of a cudgel, cut from some hedge. This stick\n",
      "had been carefully trimmed, and had an air that was not too\n",
      "threatening; the most had been made of its knots, and it had received a\n",
      "coral-like head, made from red wax: it was a cudgel, and it seemed to\n",
      "be a cane.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are but few passers-by on that boulevard, particularly in the\n",
      "winter. The man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them, but this\n",
      "without any affectation.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that epoch, King Louis XVIII. went nearly every day to\n",
      "Choisy-le-Roi: it was one of his favorite excursions. Towards two\n",
      "o’clock, almost invariably, the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen\n",
      "to pass at full speed along the Boulevard de l’Hôpital.\n",
      "\n",
      "This served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the\n",
      "quarter who said, “It is two o’clock; there he is returning to the\n",
      "Tuileries.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And some rushed forward, and others drew up in line, for a passing king\n",
      "always creates a tumult; besides, the appearance and disappearance of\n",
      "Louis XVIII. produced a certain effect in the streets of Paris. It was\n",
      "rapid but majestic. This impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop;\n",
      "as he was not able to walk, he wished to run: that cripple would gladly\n",
      "have had himself drawn by the lightning. He passed, pacific and severe,\n",
      "in the midst of naked swords. His massive couch, all covered with\n",
      "gilding, with great branches of lilies painted on the panels, thundered\n",
      "noisily along. There was hardly time to cast a glance upon it. In the\n",
      "rear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of white\n",
      "satin a large, firm, and ruddy face, a brow freshly powdered _à\n",
      "l’oiseau royal_, a proud, hard, crafty eye, the smile of an educated\n",
      "man, two great epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois\n",
      "coat, the Golden Fleece, the cross of Saint Louis, the cross of the\n",
      "Legion of Honor, the silver plaque of the Saint-Esprit, a huge belly,\n",
      "and a wide blue ribbon: it was the king. Outside of Paris, he held his\n",
      "hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high\n",
      "English gaiters; when he re-entered the city, he put on his hat and\n",
      "saluted rarely; he stared coldly at the people, and they returned it in\n",
      "kind. When he appeared for the first time in the Saint-Marceau quarter,\n",
      "the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an\n",
      "inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade, “That big fellow yonder is\n",
      "the government.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This infallible passage of the king at the same hour was, therefore,\n",

      "\n",
      "The promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the\n",
      "quarter, and probably did not belong in Paris, for he was ignorant as\n",
      "to this detail. When, at two o’clock, the royal carriage, surrounded by\n",
      "a squadron of the body-guard all covered with silver lace, debouched on\n",
      "the boulevard, after having made the turn of the Salpêtrière, he\n",
      "appeared surprised and almost alarmed. There was no one but himself in\n",
      "this cross-lane. He drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an\n",
      "enclosure, though this did not prevent M. le Duc de Havré from spying\n",
      "him out.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. le Duc de Havré, as captain of the guard on duty that day, was\n",
      "seated in the carriage, opposite the king. He said to his Majesty,\n",
      "“Yonder is an evil-looking man.” Members of the police, who were\n",
      "clearing the king’s route, took equal note of him: one of them received\n",
      "an order to follow him. But the man plunged into the deserted little\n",
      "streets of the faubourg, and as twilight was beginning to fall, the\n",
      "agent lost trace of him, as is stated in a report addressed that same\n",
      "evening to M. le Comte d’Anglès, Minister of State, Prefect of Police.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track, he\n",
      "redoubled his pace, not without turning round many a time to assure\n",
      "himself that he was not being followed. At a quarter-past four, that is\n",
      "to say, when night was fully come, he passed in front of the theatre of\n",
      "the Porte Saint-Martin, where _The Two Convicts_ was being played that\n",
      "day. This poster, illuminated by the theatre lanterns, struck him; for,\n",
      "although he was walking rapidly, he halted to read it. An instant later\n",
      "he was in the blind alley of La Planchette, and he entered the _Plat\n",
      "d’Etain_ [the Pewter Platter], where the office of the coach for Lagny\n",
      "was then situated. This coach set out at half-past four. The horses\n",
      "were harnessed, and the travellers, summoned by the coachman, were\n",
      "hastily climbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man inquired:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you a place?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only one—beside me on the box,” said the coachman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will take it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Climb up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, before setting out, the coachman cast a glance at the\n",
      "traveller’s shabby dress, at the diminutive size of his bundle, and\n",
      "made him pay his fare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you going as far as Lagny?” demanded the coachman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "The traveller paid to Lagny.\n",
      "\n",
      "They started. When they had passed the barrier, the coachman tried to\n",
      "enter into conversation, but the traveller only replied in\n",
      "monosyllables. The coachman took to whistling and swearing at his\n",
      "horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak. It was cold. The man did\n",
      "not appear to be thinking of that. Thus they passed Gournay and\n",
      "Neuilly-sur-Marne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards six o’clock in the evening they reached Chelles. The coachman\n",
      "drew up in front of the carters’ inn installed in the ancient buildings\n",
      "of the Royal Abbey, to give his horses a breathing spell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I get down here,” said the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "An instant later he had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not enter the inn.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the coach set out for Lagny a few minutes later, it did not\n",
      "encounter him in the principal street of Chelles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coachman turned to the inside travellers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There,” said he, “is a man who does not belong here, for I do not know\n",
      "him. He had not the air of owning a sou, but he does not consider\n",
      "money; he pays to Lagny, and he goes only as far as Chelles. It is\n",
      "night; all the houses are shut; he does not enter the inn, and he is\n",
      "not to be found. So he has dived through the earth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The man had not plunged into the earth, but he had gone with great\n",
      "strides through the dark, down the principal street of Chelles, then he\n",
      "had turned to the right before reaching the church, into the crossroad\n",
      "leading to Montfermeil, like a person who was acquainted with the\n",
      "country and had been there before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He followed this road rapidly. At the spot where it is intersected by\n",
      "the ancient tree-bordered road which runs from Gagny to Lagny, he heard\n",
      "people coming. He concealed himself precipitately in a ditch, and there\n",
      "waited until the passers-by were at a distance. The precaution was\n",
      "nearly superfluous, however; for, as we have already said, it was a\n",
      "very dark December night. Not more than two or three stars were visible\n",
      "in the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins. The man did not\n",
      "return to the road to Montfermeil; he struck across the fields to the\n",
      "right, and entered the forest with long strides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once in the forest he slackened his pace, and began a careful\n",
      "examination of all the trees, advancing, step by step, as though\n",
      "seeking and following a mysterious road known to himself alone. There\n",
      "came a moment when he appeared to lose himself, and he paused in\n",
      "indecision. At last he arrived, by dint of feeling his way inch by\n",
      "inch, at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones. He\n",
      "stepped up briskly to these stones, and examined them attentively\n",
      "through the mists of night, as though he were passing them in review. A\n",
      "large tree, covered with those excrescences which are the warts of\n",
      "vegetation, stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones. He went\n",
      "up to this tree and passed his hand over the bark of the trunk, as\n",
      "though seeking to recognize and count all the warts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opposite this tree, which was an ash, there was a chestnut-tree,\n",
      "suffering from a peeling of the bark, to which a band of zinc had been\n",
      "nailed by way of dressing. He raised himself on tiptoe and touched this\n",
      "band of zinc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the space\n",
      "between the tree and the heap of stones, like a person who is trying to\n",
      "assure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "That done, he took his bearings, and resumed his march through the\n",
      "forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the man who had just met Cosette.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he walked through the thicket in the direction of Montfermeil, he\n",
      "had espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan, depositing a burden on\n",
      "the ground, then taking it up and setting out again. He drew near, and\n",
      "perceived that it was a very young child, laden with an enormous bucket\n",
      "of water. Then he approached the child, and silently grasped the handle\n",

      "“Where do you live, little one?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“At Montfermeil, if you know where that is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is where we are going?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused; then began again:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was Madame Thénardier.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The man resumed, in a voice which he strove to render indifferent, but\n",
      "in which there was, nevertheless, a singular tremor:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What does your Madame Thénardier do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is my mistress,” said the child. “She keeps the inn.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The inn?” said the man. “Well, I am going to lodge there to-night.\n",
      "Show me the way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are on the way there,” said the child.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man walked tolerably fast. Cosette followed him without difficulty.\n",
      "She no longer felt any fatigue. From time to time she raised her eyes\n",
      "towards the man, with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable\n",
      "confidence. She had never been taught to turn to Providence and to\n",
      "pray; nevertheless, she felt within her something which resembled hope\n",
      "and joy, and which mounted towards heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several minutes elapsed. The man resumed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there no servant in Madame Thénardier’s house?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you alone there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another pause ensued. Cosette lifted up her voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is to say, there are two little girls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What little girls?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ponine and Zelma.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to the\n",
      "female Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are Ponine and Zelma?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are Madame Thénardier’s young ladies; her daughters, as you would\n",
      "say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what do those girls do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” said the child, “they have beautiful dolls; things with gold in\n",
      "them, all full of affairs. They play; they amuse themselves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“All day long?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I? I work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“All day long?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The child raised her great eyes, in which hung a tear, which was not\n",
      "visible because of the darkness, and replied gently:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After an interval of silence she went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sometimes, when I have finished my work and they let me, I amuse\n",
      "myself, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you amuse yourself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the best way I can. They let me alone; but I have not many\n",
      "playthings. Ponine and Zelma will not let me play with their dolls. I\n",
      "have only a little lead sword, no longer than that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The child held up her tiny finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And it will not cut?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir,” said the child; “it cuts salad and the heads of flies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They reached the village. Cosette guided the stranger through the\n",
      "streets. They passed the bakeshop, but Cosette did not think of the\n",
      "bread which she had been ordered to fetch. The man had ceased to ply\n",
      "her with questions, and now preserved a gloomy silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had left the church behind them, the man, on perceiving all\n",
      "the open-air booths, asked Cosette:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“So there is a fair going on here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir; it is Christmas.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As they approached the tavern, Cosette timidly touched his arm:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What, my child?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are quite near the house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you let me take my bucket now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“If Madame sees that some one has carried it for me, she will beat me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Cosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big\n",
      "doll, which was still displayed at the toy-merchant’s; then she\n",
      "knocked. The door opened. The Thénardier appeared with a candle in her\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! so it’s you, you little wretch! good mercy, but you’ve taken your\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Madame,” said Cosette, trembling all over, “here’s a gentleman who\n",
      "wants a lodging.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Thénardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace,\n",
      "a change of aspect common to tavern-keepers, and eagerly sought the\n",
      "newcomer with her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is the gentleman?” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Madame,” replied the man, raising his hand to his hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wealthy travellers are not so polite. This gesture, and an inspection\n",
      "of the stranger’s costume and baggage, which the Thénardier passed in\n",
      "review with one glance, caused the amiable grimace to vanish, and the\n",
      "gruff mien to reappear. She resumed dryly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Enter, my good man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The “good man” entered. The Thénardier cast a second glance at him,\n",
      "paid particular attention to his frock-coat, which was absolutely\n",
      "threadbare, and to his hat, which was a little battered, and, tossing\n",
      "her head, wrinkling her nose, and screwing up her eyes, she consulted\n",
      "her husband, who was still drinking with the carters. The husband\n",
      "replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger, which, backed\n",
      "up by an inflation of the lips, signifies in such cases: A regular\n",
      "beggar. Thereupon, the Thénardier exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! see here, my good man; I am very sorry, but I have no room left.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Put me where you like,” said the man; “in the attic, in the stable. I\n",
      "will pay as though I occupied a room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Forty sous.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Forty sous; agreed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well, then!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Forty sous!” said a carter, in a low tone, to the Thénardier woman;\n",
      "“why, the charge is only twenty sous!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is forty in his case,” retorted the Thénardier, in the same tone.\n",
      "“I don’t lodge poor folks for less.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s true,” added her husband, gently; “it ruins a house to have\n",
      "such people in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, the man, laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench,\n",
      "had seated himself at a table, on which Cosette made haste to place a\n",
      "bottle of wine and a glass. The merchant who had demanded the bucket of\n",
      "water took it to his horse himself. Cosette resumed her place under the\n",
      "kitchen table, and her knitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man, who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had\n",
      "poured out for himself, observed the child with peculiar attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette was ugly. If she had been happy, she might have been pretty. We\n",
      "have already given a sketch of that sombre little figure. Cosette was\n",
      "thin and pale; she was nearly eight years old, but she seemed to be\n",
      "hardly six. Her large eyes, sunken in a sort of shadow, were almost put\n",
      "out with weeping. The corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual\n",
      "anguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people.\n",
      "Her hands were, as her mother had divined, “ruined with chilblains.”\n",
      "The fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all\n",
      "the angles of her bones, and rendered her thinness frightfully\n",
      "apparent. As she was always shivering, she had acquired the habit of\n",
      "pressing her knees one against the other. Her entire clothing was but a\n",
      "rag which would have inspired pity in summer, and which inspired horror\n",
      "in winter. All she had on was hole-ridden linen, not a scrap of\n",
      "woollen. Her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and\n",
      "blue spots could be descried, which marked the places where the\n",
      "Thénardier woman had touched her. Her naked legs were thin and red. The\n",
      "hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep. This child’s whole\n",
      "person, her mien, her attitude, the sound of her voice, the intervals\n",
      "which she allowed to elapse between one word and the next, her glance,\n",
      "her silence, her slightest gesture, expressed and betrayed one sole\n",
      "idea,—fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fear was diffused all over her; she was covered with it, so to speak;\n",
      "fear drew her elbows close to her hips, withdrew her heels under her\n",
      "petticoat, made her occupy as little space as possible, allowed her\n",
      "only the breath that was absolutely necessary, and had become what\n",
      "might be called the habit of her body, admitting of no possible\n",
      "variation except an increase. In the depths of her eyes there was an\n",
      "astonished nook where terror lurked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her fear was such, that on her arrival, wet as she was, Cosette did not\n",
      "dare to approach the fire and dry herself, but sat silently down to her\n",
      "work again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The expression in the glance of that child of eight years was\n",
      "habitually so gloomy, and at times so tragic, that it seemed at certain\n",
      "moments as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a\n",
      "demon.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we have stated, she had never known what it is to pray; she had\n",
      "never set foot in a church. “Have I the time?” said the Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from Cosette.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once, the Thénardier exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the way, where’s that bread?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette, according to her custom whenever the Thénardier uplifted her\n",
      "voice, emerged with great haste from beneath the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had completely forgotten the bread. She had recourse to the\n",
      "expedient of children who live in a constant state of fear. She lied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Madame, the baker’s shop was shut.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll find out to-morrow whether that is true,” said the Thénardier;\n",
      "“and if you are telling me a lie, I’ll lead you a pretty dance. In the\n",
      "meantime, give me back my fifteen-sou piece.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron, and turned\n",
      "green. The fifteen-sou piece was not there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, come now,” said Madame Thénardier, “did you hear me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette turned her pocket inside out; there was nothing in it. What\n",
      "could have become of that money? The unhappy little creature could not\n",
      "find a word to say. She was petrified.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you lost that fifteen-sou piece?” screamed the Thénardier,\n",
      "hoarsely, “or do you want to rob me of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, she stretched out her arm towards the\n",
      "cat-o’-nine-tails which hung on a nail in the chimney-corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "This formidable gesture restored to Cosette sufficient strength to\n",
      "shriek:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mercy, Madame, Madame! I will not do so any more!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Thénardier took down the whip.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the\n",
      "fob of his waistcoat, without any one having noticed his movements.\n",
      "Besides, the other travellers were drinking or playing cards, and were\n",
      "not paying attention to anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette contracted herself into a ball, with anguish, within the angle\n",
      "of the chimney, endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half-nude\n",
      "limbs. The Thénardier raised her arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon me, Madame,” said the man, “but just now I caught sight of\n",
      "something which had fallen from this little one’s apron pocket, and\n",
      "rolled aside. Perhaps this is it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor\n",
      "for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly; here it is,” he went on, straightening himself up.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he held out a silver coin to the Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, that’s it,” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not it, for it was a twenty-sou piece; but the Thénardier found\n",
      "it to her advantage. She put the coin in her pocket, and confined\n",
      "herself to casting a fierce glance at the child, accompanied with the\n",
      "remark, “Don’t let this ever happen again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette returned to what the Thénardier called “her kennel,” and her\n",
      "large eyes, which were riveted on the traveller, began to take on an\n",
      "expression such as they had never worn before. Thus far it was only an\n",
      "innocent amazement, but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the way, would you like some supper?” the Thénardier inquired of\n",
      "the traveller.\n",
      "\n",
      "He made no reply. He appeared to be absorbed in thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What sort of a man is that?” she muttered between her teeth. “He’s\n",
      "some frightfully poor wretch. He hasn’t a sou to pay for a supper. Will\n",
      "he even pay me for his lodging? It’s very lucky, all the same, that it\n",
      "did not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, a door had opened, and Éponine and Azelma entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were two really pretty little girls, more bourgeois than peasant\n",
      "in looks, and very charming; the one with shining chestnut tresses, the\n",
      "other with long black braids hanging down her back, both vivacious,\n",
      "neat, plump, rosy, and healthy, and a delight to the eye. They were\n",
      "warmly clad, but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the\n",
      "stuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement. There was a\n",
      "hint of winter, though the springtime was not wholly effaced. Light\n",
      "emanated from these two little beings. Besides this, they were on the\n",
      "throne. In their toilettes, in their gayety, in the noise which they\n",
      "made, there was sovereignty. When they entered, the Thénardier said to\n",
      "them in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration, “Ah! there you\n",
      "are, you children!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then drawing them, one after the other to her knees, smoothing their\n",
      "hair, tying their ribbons afresh, and then releasing them with that\n",
      "gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers, she\n",
      "exclaimed, “What frights they are!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They went and seated themselves in the chimney-corner. They had a doll,\n",
      "which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous\n",
      "chatter. From time to time Cosette raised her eyes from her knitting,\n",
      "and watched their play with a melancholy air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Éponine and Azelma did not look at Cosette. She was the same as a dog\n",
      "to them. These three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty\n",
      "years between them, but they already represented the whole society of\n",
      "man; envy on the one side, disdain on the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doll of the Thénardier sisters was very much faded, very old, and\n",
      "much broken; but it seemed nonetheless admirable to Cosette, who had\n",
      "never had a doll in her life, _a real doll_, to make use of the\n",
      "expression which all children will understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once, the Thénardier, who had been going back and forth in the\n",
      "room, perceived that Cosette’s mind was distracted, and that, instead\n",
      "of working, she was paying attention to the little ones at their play.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! I’ve caught you at it!” she cried. “So that’s the way you work!\n",
      "I’ll make you work to the tune of the whip; that I will.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger turned to the Thénardier, without quitting his chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bah, Madame,” he said, with an almost timid air, “let her play!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton\n",
      "and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper, and who had\n",
      "not the air of being frightfully poor, would have been equivalent to an\n",
      "order. But that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a\n",
      "desire, and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a\n",
      "will, was something which Madame Thénardier did not intend to tolerate.\n",
      "She retorted with acrimony:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“She must work, since she eats. I don’t feed her to do nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is she making?” went on the stranger, in a gentle voice which\n",

      "\n",
      "The man looked at Cosette’s poor little red feet, and continued:—\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Play!” said the Thénardier, in a terrible voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thanks, Madame,” said Cosette.\n",

      "Éponine and Azelma paid no attention to what was going on. They had\n",

      "elder, was swathing the little cat, in spite of its mewing and its\n",
      "contortions, in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps. While\n",
      "performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister\n",
      "in that sweet and adorable language of children, whose grace, like the\n",
      "splendor of the butterfly’s wing, vanishes when one essays to fix it\n",
      "fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see, sister, this doll is more amusing than the other. She twists,\n",
      "she cries, she is warm. See, sister, let us play with her. She shall be\n",
      "my little girl. I will be a lady. I will come to see you, and you shall\n",
      "look at her. Gradually, you will perceive her whiskers, and that will\n",
      "surprise you. And then you will see her ears, and then you will see her\n",
      "tail and it will amaze you. And you will say to me, ‘Ah! Mon Dieu!’ and\n",
      "I will say to you: ‘Yes, Madame, it is my little girl. Little girls are\n",

      "encouraged them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As birds make nests out of everything, so children make a doll out of\n",
      "anything which comes to hand. While Éponine and Azelma were bundling up\n",
      "the cat, Cosette, on her side, had dressed up her sword. That done, she\n",
      "laid it in her arms, and sang to it softly, to lull it to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doll is one of the most imperious needs and, at the same time, one\n",
      "of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood. To care for, to\n",
      "clothe, to deck, to dress, to undress, to redress, to teach, scold a\n",
      "little, to rock, to dandle, to lull to sleep, to imagine that something\n",
      "is some one,—therein lies the whole woman’s future. While dreaming and\n",
      "chattering, making tiny outfits, and baby clothes, while sewing little\n",
      "gowns, and corsages and bodices, the child grows into a young girl, the\n",
      "young girl into a big girl, the big girl into a woman. The first child\n",
      "is the continuation of the last doll.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy, and quite as\n",
      "impossible, as a woman without children.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Thénardier approached _the yellow man_; “My husband is right,”\n",

      "\n",

      "_bonhomme_.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see, sir,” she pursued, assuming a sweetish air that was even more\n",
      "repulsive to behold than her fierce mien, “I am willing that the child\n",
      "should play; I do not oppose it, but it is good for once, because you\n",
      "are generous. You see, she has nothing; she must needs work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then this child is not yours?” demanded the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! mon Dieu! no, sir! she is a little beggar whom we have taken in\n",
      "through charity; a sort of imbecile child. She must have water on the\n",
      "brain; she has a large head, as you see. We do what we can for her, for\n",
      "we are not rich; we have written in vain to her native place, and have\n",
      "received no reply these six months. It must be that her mother is\n",
      "dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” said the man, and fell into his reverie once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her mother didn’t amount to much,” added the Thénardier; “she\n",
      "abandoned her child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "During the whole of this conversation Cosette, as though warned by some\n",
      "instinct that she was under discussion, had not taken her eyes from the\n",
      "Thénardier’s face; she listened vaguely; she caught a few words here\n",
      "and there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the drinkers, all three-quarters intoxicated, were repeating\n",
      "their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety; it was a highly spiced and\n",
      "wanton song, in which the Virgin and the infant Jesus were introduced.\n",
      "The Thénardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter.\n",
      "Cosette, from her post under the table, gazed at the fire, which was\n",
      "reflected from her fixed eyes. She had begun to rock the sort of baby\n",
      "which she had made, and, as she rocked it, she sang in a low voice, “My\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On being urged afresh by the hostess, the yellow man, “the\n",

      "“What does Monsieur wish?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "All at once, Cosette paused; she had just turned round and caught sight\n",
      "of the little Thénardiers’ doll, which they had abandoned for the cat\n",
      "and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she dropped the swaddled sword, which only half met her needs, and\n",
      "cast her eyes slowly round the room. Madame Thénardier was whispering\n",
      "to her husband and counting over some money; Ponine and Zelma were\n",
      "playing with the cat; the travellers were eating or drinking or\n",
      "singing; not a glance was fixed on her. She had not a moment to lose;\n",
      "she crept out from under the table on her hands and knees, made sure\n",
      "once more that no one was watching her; then she slipped quickly up to\n",
      "the doll and seized it. An instant later she was in her place again,\n",
      "seated motionless, and only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll\n",
      "which she held in her arms. The happiness of playing with a doll was so\n",
      "rare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one had seen her, except the traveller, who was slowly devouring his\n",

      "\n",
      "But with all the precautions that Cosette had taken she did not\n",
      "perceive that one of the doll’s legs stuck out and that the fire on the\n",
      "hearth lighted it up very vividly. That pink and shining foot,\n",
      "projecting from the shadow, suddenly struck the eye of Azelma, who said\n",
      "to Éponine, “Look! sister.”\n",
      "\n",

      "their doll!\n",
      "\n",
      "Éponine rose, and, without releasing the cat, she ran to her mother,\n",
      "and began to tug at her skirt.\n",

      "\n",
      "From time to time the Thénardier went to the other end of the room\n",
      "where her husband was, to _relieve her soul_, as she said. She\n",
      "exchanged with her husband words which were all the more furious\n",
      "because she dared not utter them aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Old beast! What has he got in his belly, to come and upset us in this\n",
      "manner! To want that little monster to play! to give away forty-franc\n",
      "dolls to a jade that I would sell for forty sous, so I would! A little\n",
      "more and he will be saying _Your Majesty_ to her, as though to the\n",
      "Duchesse de Berry! Is there any sense in it? Is he mad, then, that\n",
      "mysterious old fellow?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why! it is perfectly simple,” replied Thénardier, “if that amuses him!\n",
      "It amuses you to have the little one work; it amuses him to have her\n",
      "play. He’s all right. A traveller can do what he pleases when he pays\n",
      "for it. If the old fellow is a philanthropist, what is that to you? If\n",
      "he is an imbecile, it does not concern you. What are you worrying for,\n",
      "so long as he has money?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The language of a master, and the reasoning of an innkeeper, neither of\n",
      "which admitted of any reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man had placed his elbows on the table, and resumed his thoughtful\n",
      "attitude. All the other travellers, both pedlers and carters, had\n",
      "withdrawn a little, and had ceased singing. They were staring at him\n",
      "from a distance, with a sort of respectful awe. This poorly dressed\n",
      "man, who drew “hind-wheels” from his pocket with so much ease, and who\n",
      "lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes, was\n",
      "certainly a magnificent fellow, and one to be feared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many hours passed. The midnight mass was over, the chimes had ceased,\n",
      "the drinkers had taken their departure, the drinking-shop was closed,\n",
      "the public room was deserted, the fire extinct, the stranger still\n",
      "remained in the same place and the same attitude. From time to time he\n",
      "changed the elbow on which he leaned. That was all; but he had not said\n",
      "a word since Cosette had left the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Thénardiers alone, out of politeness and curiosity, had remained in\n",
      "the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he going to pass the night in that fashion?” grumbled the\n",
      "Thénardier. When two o’clock in the morning struck, she declared\n",
      "herself vanquished, and said to her husband, “I’m going to bed. Do as\n",
      "you like.” Her husband seated himself at a table in the corner, lighted\n",
      "a candle, and began to read the _Courrier Français_.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good hour passed thus. The worthy inn-keeper had perused the\n",
      "_Courrier Français_ at least three times, from the date of the number\n",
      "to the printer’s name. The stranger did not stir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier fidgeted, coughed, spit, blew his nose, and creaked his\n",
      "chair. Not a movement on the man’s part. “Is he asleep?” thought\n",
      "Thénardier. The man was not asleep, but nothing could arouse him.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Thénardier took off his cap, stepped gently up to him, and\n",
      "ventured to say:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is not Monsieur going to his repose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "_Not going to bed_ would have seemed to him excessive and familiar. _To\n",
      "repose_ smacked of luxury and respect. These words possess the\n",
      "mysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following\n",
      "day. A chamber where one _sleeps_ costs twenty sous; a chamber in which\n",
      "one _reposes_ costs twenty francs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” said the stranger, “you are right. Where is your stable?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir!” exclaimed Thénardier, with a smile, “I will conduct you, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the candle; the man picked up his bundle and cudgel, and\n",
      "Thénardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor, which was of\n",
      "rare splendor, all furnished in mahogany, with a low bedstead,\n",
      "curtained with red calico.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is this?” said the traveller.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is really our bridal chamber,” said the tavern-keeper. “My wife and\n",
      "I occupy another. This is only entered three or four times a year.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should have liked the stable quite as well,” said the man, abruptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "He lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the\n",
      "chimney-piece. A very good fire was flickering on the hearth.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the chimney-piece, under a glass globe, stood a woman’s head-dress\n",
      "in silver wire and orange flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what is this?” resumed the stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That, sir,” said Thénardier, “is my wife’s wedding bonnet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say,\n",
      "“There really was a time, then, when that monster was a maiden?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier lied, however. When he had leased this paltry building for\n",
      "the purpose of converting it into a tavern, he had found this chamber\n",
      "decorated in just this manner, and had purchased the furniture and\n",
      "obtained the orange flowers at second hand, with the idea that this\n",
      "would cast a graceful shadow on “his spouse,” and would result in what\n",
      "the English call respectability for his house.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the traveller turned round, the host had disappeared. Thénardier\n",
      "had withdrawn discreetly, without venturing to wish him a good night,\n",
      "as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he\n",
      "proposed to fleece royally the following morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inn-keeper retired to his room. His wife was in bed, but she was\n",
      "not asleep. When she heard her husband’s step she turned over and said\n",
      "to him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know, I’m going to turn Cosette out of doors to-morrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier replied coldly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“How you do go on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They exchanged no further words, and a few moments later their candle\n",
      "was extinguished.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the traveller, he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a\n",
      "corner. The landlord once gone, he threw himself into an armchair and\n",
      "remained for some time buried in thought. Then he removed his shoes,\n",
      "took one of the two candles, blew out the other, opened the door, and\n",
      "quitted the room, gazing about him like a person who is in search of\n",
      "something. He traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase. There he\n",
      "heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child. He\n",
      "followed this sound, and came to a sort of triangular recess built\n",
      "under the staircase, or rather formed by the staircase itself. This\n",
      "recess was nothing else than the space under the steps. There, in the\n",
      "midst of all sorts of old papers and potsherds, among dust and spiders’\n",
      "webs, was a bed—if one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so\n",
      "full of holes as to display the straw, and a coverlet so tattered as to\n",
      "show the pallet. No sheets. This was placed on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this bed Cosette was sleeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man approached and gazed down upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette was in a profound sleep; she was fully dressed. In the winter\n",
      "she did not undress, in order that she might not be so cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Against her breast was pressed the doll, whose large eyes, wide open,\n",
      "glittered in the dark. From time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh\n",
      "as though she were on the point of waking, and she strained the doll\n",
      "almost convulsively in her arms. Beside her bed there was only one of\n",
      "her wooden shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A door which stood open near Cosette’s pallet permitted a view of a\n",
      "rather large, dark room. The stranger stepped into it. At the further\n",
      "extremity, through a glass door, he saw two small, very white beds.\n",
      "They belonged to Éponine and Azelma. Behind these beds, and half\n",
      "hidden, stood an uncurtained wicker cradle, in which the little boy who\n",
      "had cried all the evening lay asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the\n",
      "Thénardier pair. He was on the point of retreating when his eye fell\n",
      "upon the fireplace—one of those vast tavern chimneys where there is\n",
      "always so little fire when there is any fire at all, and which are so\n",
      "cold to look at. There was no fire in this one, there was not even\n",
      "ashes; but there was something which attracted the stranger’s gaze,\n",
      "nevertheless. It was two tiny children’s shoes, coquettish in shape and\n",
      "unequal in size. The traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial\n",
      "custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the\n",
      "chimney on Christmas eve, there to await in the darkness some sparkling\n",
      "gift from their good fairy. Éponine and Azelma had taken care not to\n",
      "omit this, and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The traveller bent over them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fairy, that is to say, their mother, had already paid her visit,\n",
      "and in each he saw a brand-new and shining ten-sou piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man straightened himself up, and was on the point of withdrawing,\n",
      "when far in, in the darkest corner of the hearth, he caught sight of\n",
      "another object. He looked at it, and recognized a wooden shoe, a\n",
      "frightful shoe of the coarsest description, half dilapidated and all\n",
      "covered with ashes and dried mud. It was Cosette’s sabot. Cosette, with\n",
      "that touching trust of childhood, which can always be deceived yet\n",
      "never discouraged, had placed her shoe on the hearth-stone also.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and\n",
      "touching thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing in this wooden shoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger fumbled in his waistcoat, bent over and placed a louis\n",
      "d’or in Cosette’s shoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf.\n",

      "\n",
      "On the following morning, two hours at least before day-break,\n",
      "Thénardier, seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern,\n",
      "pen in hand, was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow\n",
      "coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "His wife, standing beside him, and half bent over him, was following\n",
      "him with her eyes. They exchanged not a word. On the one hand, there\n",
      "was profound meditation, on the other, the religious admiration with\n",
      "which one watches the birth and development of a marvel of the human\n",
      "mind. A noise was audible in the house; it was the Lark sweeping the\n",
      "stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the lapse of a good quarter of an hour, and some erasures,\n",
      "Thénardier produced the following masterpiece:—\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was written _servisse_.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Twenty-three francs!” cried the woman, with an enthusiasm which was\n",
      "mingled with some hesitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like all great artists, Thénardier was dissatisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peuh!” he exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the accent of Castlereagh auditing France’s bill at the Congress\n",
      "of Vienna.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur Thénardier, you are right; he certainly owes that,” murmured\n",
      "the wife, who was thinking of the doll bestowed on Cosette in the\n",
      "presence of her daughters. “It is just, but it is too much. He will not\n",
      "pay it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier laughed coldly, as usual, and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“He will pay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority. That\n",
      "which was asserted in this manner must needs be so. His wife did not\n",
      "insist.\n",
      "\n",
      "She set about arranging the table; her husband paced the room. A moment\n",
      "later he added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I owe full fifteen hundred francs!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He went and seated himself in the chimney-corner, meditating, with his\n",
      "feet among the warm ashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! by the way,” resumed his wife, “you don’t forget that I’m going to\n",
      "turn Cosette out of doors to-day? The monster! She breaks my heart with\n",
      "that doll of hers! I’d rather marry Louis XVIII. than keep her another\n",
      "day in the house!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier lighted his pipe, and replied between two puffs:—\n",

      "“You will hand that bill to the man.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Up so early?” said Madame Thénardier; “is Monsieur leaving us\n",
      "already?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke thus, she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an\n",
      "embarrassed air, and making creases in it with her nails. Her hard face\n",
      "presented a shade which was not habitual with it,—timidity and\n",
      "scruples.\n",
      "\n",
      "To present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air “of a\n",
      "poor wretch” seemed difficult to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absent-minded. He\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“So so, Monsieur,” replied the Thénardier, stupefied at not witnessing\n",
      "another sort of explosion.\n",
      "\n",
      "She continued, in a dreary and lamentable tone:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Monsieur, times are so hard! and then, we have so few bourgeois in\n",
      "the neighborhood! All the people are poor, you see. If we had not, now\n",
      "and then, some rich and generous travellers like Monsieur, we should\n",
      "not get along at all. We have so many expenses. Just see, that child is\n",
      "costing us our very eyes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What child?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, the little one, you know! Cosette—the Lark, as she is called\n",
      "hereabouts!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” said the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“How stupid these peasants are with their nicknames! She has more the\n",
      "air of a bat than of a lark. You see, sir, we do not ask charity, and\n",
      "we cannot bestow it. We earn nothing and we have to pay out a great\n",
      "deal. The license, the imposts, the door and window tax, the\n",
      "hundredths! Monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible\n",
      "deal of money. And then, I have my daughters. I have no need to bring\n",
      "up other people’s children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The man resumed, in that voice which he strove to render indifferent,\n",
      "and in which there lingered a tremor:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What if one were to rid you of her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who? Cosette?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The landlady’s red and violent face brightened up hideously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! sir, my dear sir, take her, keep her, lead her off, carry her\n",
      "away, sugar her, stuff her with truffles, drink her, eat her, and the\n",

      "upon you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Immediately. Call the child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cosette!” screamed the Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the meantime,” pursued the man, “I will pay you what I owe you. How\n",
      "much is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He cast a glance on the bill, and could not restrain a start of\n",
      "surprise:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Twenty-three francs!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at the landlady, and repeated:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Twenty-three francs?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was in the enunciation of these words, thus repeated, an accent\n",
      "between an exclamation and an interrogation point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Thénardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock. She\n",
      "replied, with assurance:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good gracious, yes, sir, it is twenty-three francs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger laid five five-franc pieces on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go and get the child,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment Thénardier advanced to the middle of the room, and\n",
      "said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur owes twenty-six sous.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Twenty-six sous!” exclaimed his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Twenty sous for the chamber,” resumed Thénardier, coldly, “and six\n",
      "sous for his supper. As for the child, I must discuss that matter a\n",

      "the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they were alone, Thénardier offered the traveller a chair.\n",

      "your hundred-sou piece. I adore the child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whom do you mean?” demanded the stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eh! our little Cosette! Are you not intending to take her away from\n",
      "us? Well, I speak frankly; as true as you are an honest man, I will not\n",
      "consent to it. I shall miss that child. I saw her first when she was a\n",
      "tiny thing. It is true that she costs us money; it is true that she has\n",
      "her faults; it is true that we are not rich; it is true that I have\n",
      "paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her\n",
      "illnesses! But one must do something for the good God’s sake. She has\n",
      "neither father nor mother. I have brought her up. I have bread enough\n",
      "for her and for myself. In truth, I think a great deal of that child.\n",
      "You understand, one conceives an affection for a person; I am a good\n",
      "sort of a beast, I am; I do not reason; I love that little girl; my\n",
      "wife is quick-tempered, but she loves her also. You see, she is just\n",
      "the same as our own child. I want to keep her to babble about the\n",
      "house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger kept his eye intently fixed on Thénardier. The latter\n",
      "continued:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me, sir, but one does not give away one’s child to a passer-by,\n",
      "like that. I am right, am I not? Still, I don’t say—you are rich; you\n",
      "have the air of a very good man,—if it were for her happiness. But one\n",
      "must find out that. You understand: suppose that I were to let her go\n",
      "and to sacrifice myself, I should like to know what becomes of her; I\n",
      "should not wish to lose sight of her; I should like to know with whom\n",
      "she is living, so that I could go to see her from time to time; so that\n",
      "she may know that her good foster-father is alive, that he is watching\n",
      "over her. In short, there are things which are not possible. I do not\n",
      "even know your name. If you were to take her away, I should say: ‘Well,\n",
      "and the Lark, what has become of her?’ One must, at least, see some\n",
      "petty scrap of paper, some trifle in the way of a passport, you know!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger, still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates, as\n",
      "the saying goes, to the very depths of the conscience, replied in a\n",
      "grave, firm voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur Thénardier, one does not require a passport to travel five\n",
      "leagues from Paris. If I take Cosette away, I shall take her away, and\n",
      "that is the end of the matter. You will not know my name, you will not\n",
      "know my residence, you will not know where she is; and my intention is\n",
      "that she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives. I\n",
      "break the thread which binds her foot, and she departs. Does that suit\n",
      "you? Yes or no?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Since geniuses, like demons, recognize the presence of a superior God\n",
      "by certain signs, Thénardier comprehended that he had to deal with a\n",
      "very strong person. It was like an intuition; he comprehended it with\n",
      "his clear and sagacious promptitude. While drinking with the carters,\n",
      "smoking, and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening, he had\n",
      "devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger, watching him\n",
      "like a cat, and studying him like a mathematician. He had watched him,\n",
      "both on his own account, for the pleasure of the thing, and through\n",
      "instinct, and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for so\n",
      "doing. Not a movement, not a gesture, on the part of the man in the\n",
      "yellow great-coat had escaped him. Even before the stranger had so\n",
      "clearly manifested his interest in Cosette, Thénardier had divined his\n",
      "purpose. He had caught the old man’s deep glances returning constantly\n",
      "to the child. Who was this man? Why this interest? Why this hideous\n",
      "costume, when he had so much money in his purse? Questions which he put\n",
      "to himself without being able to solve them, and which irritated him.\n",
      "He had pondered it all night long. He could not be Cosette’s father.\n",
      "Was he her grandfather? Then why not make himself known at once? When\n",
      "one has a right, one asserts it. This man evidently had no right over\n",
      "Cosette. What was it, then? Thénardier lost himself in conjectures. He\n",
      "caught glimpses of everything, but he saw nothing. Be that as it may,\n",
      "on entering into conversation with the man, sure that there was some\n",
      "secret in the case, that the latter had some interest in remaining in\n",
      "the shadow, he felt himself strong; when he perceived from the\n",
      "stranger’s clear and firm retort, that this mysterious personage was\n",
      "mysterious in so simple a way, he became conscious that he was weak. He\n",
      "had expected nothing of the sort. His conjectures were put to the rout.\n",
      "He rallied his ideas. He weighed everything in the space of a second.\n",
      "Thénardier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance. He\n",
      "decided that the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward, and\n",
      "quickly at that. He did as great leaders do at the decisive moment,\n",
      "which they know that they alone recognize; he abruptly unmasked his\n",
      "batteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir,” said he, “I am in need of fifteen hundred francs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black\n",
      "leather, opened it, drew out three bank-bills, which he laid on the\n",
      "table. Then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the\n",
      "inn-keeper:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go and fetch Cosette.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While this was taking place, what had Cosette been doing?\n",
      "\n",
      "On waking up, Cosette had run to get her shoe. In it she had found the\n",
      "gold piece. It was not a Napoleon; it was one of those perfectly new\n",
      "twenty-franc pieces of the Restoration, on whose effigy the little\n",
      "Prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath. Cosette was dazzled. Her\n",
      "destiny began to intoxicate her. She did not know what a gold piece\n",
      "was; she had never seen one; she hid it quickly in her pocket, as\n",
      "though she had stolen it. Still, she felt that it really was hers; she\n",
      "guessed whence her gift had come, but the joy which she experienced was\n",
      "full of fear. She was happy; above all she was stupefied. Such\n",
      "magnificent and beautiful things did not appear real. The doll\n",
      "frightened her, the gold piece frightened her. She trembled vaguely in\n",
      "the presence of this magnificence. The stranger alone did not frighten\n",
      "her. On the contrary, he reassured her. Ever since the preceding\n",
      "evening, amid all her amazement, even in her sleep, she had been\n",
      "thinking in her little childish mind of that man who seemed to be so\n",
      "poor and so sad, and who was so rich and so kind. Everything had\n",
      "changed for her since she had met that good man in the forest. Cosette,\n",
      "less happy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven, had never\n",
      "known what it was to take refuge under a mother’s shadow and under a\n",
      "wing. For the last five years, that is to say, as far back as her\n",
      "memory ran, the poor child had shivered and trembled. She had always\n",
      "been exposed completely naked to the sharp wind of adversity; now it\n",
      "seemed to her she was clothed. Formerly her soul had seemed cold, now\n",
      "it was warm. Cosette was no longer afraid of the Thénardier. She was no\n",
      "longer alone; there was some one there.\n",
      "\n",
      "She hastily set about her regular morning duties. That louis, which she\n",
      "had about her, in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen-sou piece\n",
      "had fallen on the night before, distracted her thoughts. She dared not\n",
      "touch it, but she spent five minutes in gazing at it, with her tongue\n",
      "hanging out, if the truth must be told. As she swept the staircase, she\n",
      "paused, remained standing there motionless, forgetful of her broom and\n",
      "of the entire universe, occupied in gazing at that star which was\n",
      "blazing at the bottom of her pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was during one of these periods of contemplation that the Thénardier\n",
      "joined her. She had gone in search of Cosette at her husband’s orders.\n",
      "What was quite unprecedented, she neither struck her nor said an\n",
      "insulting word to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cosette,” she said, almost gently, “come immediately.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "An instant later Cosette entered the public room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it.\n",
      "This bundle contained a little woollen gown, an apron, a fustian\n",
      "bodice, a kerchief, a petticoat, woollen stockings, shoes—a complete\n",
      "outfit for a girl of seven years. All was black.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My child,” said the man, “take these, and go and dress yourself\n",
      "quickly.”\n",
      "\n",

      "Daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of Montfermeil who\n",
      "had begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading a\n",
      "little girl dressed in mourning, and carrying a pink doll in her arms,\n",
      "pass along the road to Paris. They were going in the direction of\n",
      "Livry.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was our man and Cosette.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one knew the man; as Cosette was no longer in rags, many did not\n",
      "recognize her. Cosette was going away. With whom? She did not know.\n",
      "Whither? She knew not. All that she understood was that she was leaving\n",
      "the Thénardier tavern behind her. No one had thought of bidding her\n",
      "farewell, nor had she thought of taking leave of any one. She was\n",
      "leaving that hated and hating house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor, gentle creature, whose heart had been repressed up to that hour!\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette walked along gravely, with her large eyes wide open, and gazing\n",
      "at the sky. She had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron. From\n",
      "time to time, she bent down and glanced at it; then she looked at the\n",

      "Madame Thénardier had allowed her husband to have his own way, as was\n",
      "her wont. She had expected great results. When the man and Cosette had\n",

      "\n",
      "“Is that all?” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had\n",

      "\n",
      "The blow told.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are right, in sooth,” said he; “I am a fool. Give me my hat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He folded up the three bank-bills, thrust them into his pocket, and ran\n",
      "out in all haste; but he made a mistake and turned to the right first.\n",
      "Some neighbors, of whom he made inquiries, put him on the track again;\n",
      "the Lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of Livry. He\n",
      "followed these hints, walking with great strides, and talking to\n",
      "himself the while:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“That man is evidently a million dressed in yellow, and I am an animal.\n",
      "First he gave twenty sous, then five francs, then fifty francs, then\n",
      "fifteen hundred francs, all with equal readiness. He would have given\n",
      "fifteen thousand francs. But I shall overtake him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child; all\n",
      "that was singular; many mysteries lay concealed under it. One does not\n",
      "let mysteries out of one’s hand when one has once grasped them. The\n",
      "secrets of the wealthy are sponges of gold; one must know how to\n",
      "subject them to pressure. All these thoughts whirled through his brain.\n",
      "“I am an animal,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "When one leaves Montfermeil and reaches the turn which the road takes\n",
      "that runs to Livry, it can be seen stretching out before one to a great\n",
      "distance across the plateau. On arriving there, he calculated that he\n",
      "ought to be able to see the old man and the child. He looked as far as\n",
      "his vision reached, and saw nothing. He made fresh inquiries, but he\n",
      "had wasted time. Some passers-by informed him that the man and child of\n",
      "whom he was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of\n",
      "Gagny. He hastened in that direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were far in advance of him; but a child walks slowly, and he\n",
      "walked fast; and then, he was well acquainted with the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a\n",
      "man who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace\n",
      "his steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I ought to have taken my gun,” said he to himself.\n",

      "Thénardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass through\n",
      "our midst without our being aware of the fact, and who disappear\n",
      "without our finding them out, because destiny has only exhibited one\n",
      "side of them. It is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged.\n",
      "In a calm and even situation, Thénardier possessed all that is required\n",
      "to make—we will not say to be—what people have agreed to call an honest\n",
      "trader, a good bourgeois. At the same time certain circumstances being\n",
      "given, certain shocks arriving to bring his under-nature to the\n",
      "surface, he had all the requisites for a blackguard. He was a\n",
      "shopkeeper in whom there was some taint of the monster. Satan must have\n",
      "occasionally crouched down in some corner of the hovel in which\n",

      "\n",
      "“Bah!” he thought; “they will have time to make their escape.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he pursued his road, walking rapidly straight ahead, and with\n",
      "almost an air of certainty, with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey\n",
      "of partridges.\n",
      "\n",
      "In truth, when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an oblique\n",

      "Bellevue, and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit of\n",
      "the hill, and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the Abbey of\n",
      "Chelles, he caught sight, over the top of the brushwood, of the hat on\n",
      "which he had already erected so many conjectures; it was that man’s\n",
      "hat. The brushwood was not high. Thénardier recognized the fact that\n",

      "\n",
      "Thénardier was not mistaken. The man was sitting there, and letting\n",

      "“You are go-ing to take back Co-sette?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir, I am. I will tell you; I have considered the matter. In\n",
      "fact, I have not the right to give her to you. I am an honest man, you\n",
      "see; this child does not belong to me; she belongs to her mother. It\n",
      "was her mother who confided her to me; I can only resign her to her\n",
      "mother. You will say to me, ‘But her mother is dead.’ Good; in that\n",
      "case I can only give the child up to the person who shall bring me a\n",
      "writing, signed by her mother, to the effect that I am to hand the\n",
      "child over to the person therein mentioned; that is clear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The man, without making any reply, fumbled in his pocket, and\n",

      "once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tavern-keeper shivered with joy.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Before opening the pocket-book, the traveller cast a glance about him:\n",
      "the spot was absolutely deserted; there was not a soul either in the\n",
      "woods or in the valley. The man opened his pocket-book once more and\n",
      "drew from it, not the handful of bills which Thénardier expected, but a\n",
      "simple little paper, which he unfolded and presented fully open to the\n",
      "inn-keeper, saying:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are right; read!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier took the paper and read:—\n",

      "\n",
      "There was no reply to make; he experienced two violent vexations, the\n",

      "vexation of being beaten; the man added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may keep this paper as your receipt.”\n",

      "The winter had thinned out the forest, so that Thénardier did not lose\n",
      "them from sight, although he kept at a good distance. The man turned\n",
      "round from time to time, and looked to see if he was being followed.\n",
      "All at once he caught sight of Thénardier. He plunged suddenly into the\n",

      "The thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them.\n",
      "When the man had reached the densest part of the thicket, he wheeled\n",

      "him an uneasy glance, then elevated his head and continued his course.\n",
      "The inn-keeper set out again in pursuit. Thus they continued for two or\n",
      "three hundred paces. All at once the man turned round once more; he saw\n",
      "the inn-keeper. This time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that\n",

      "\n",
      "When he fell into the sea, or rather, when he threw himself into it, he\n",

      "fugitives who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social\n",
      "fatality, pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary. He found his\n",
      "first refuge at Pradeaux, near Beausset. Then he directed his course\n",
      "towards Grand-Villard, near Briançon, in the Hautes-Alpes. It was a\n",
      "fumbling and uneasy flight,—a mole’s track, whose branchings are\n",

      "distances on foot. She made no complaint, but she was weary, and Jean\n",

      "Forty years ago, a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country\n",
      "of the Salpêtrière, and who had mounted to the Barrière d’Italie by way\n",
      "of the boulevard, reached a point where it might be said that Paris\n",
      "disappeared. It was no longer solitude, for there were passers-by; it\n",
      "was not the country, for there were houses and streets; it was not the\n",
      "city, for the streets had ruts like highways, and the grass grew in\n",
      "them; it was not a village, the houses were too lofty. What was it,\n",
      "then? It was an inhabited spot where there was no one; it was a desert\n",
      "place where there was some one; it was a boulevard of the great city, a\n",
      "street of Paris; more wild at night than the forest, more gloomy by day\n",
      "than a cemetery.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the old quarter of the Marché-aux-Chevaux.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rambler, if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of\n",
      "this Marché-aux-Chevaux; if he consented even to pass beyond the Rue du\n",
      "Petit-Banquier, after leaving on his right a garden protected by high\n",
      "walls; then a field in which tan-bark mills rose like gigantic beaver\n",
      "huts; then an enclosure encumbered with timber, with a heap of stumps,\n",
      "sawdust, and shavings, on which stood a large dog, barking; then a\n",
      "long, low, utterly dilapidated wall, with a little black door in\n",
      "mourning, laden with mosses, which were covered with flowers in the\n",
      "spring; then, in the most deserted spot, a frightful and decrepit\n",
      "building, on which ran the inscription in large letters: POST NO\n",
      "BILLS,—this daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at\n",
      "the corner of the Rue des Vignes-Saint-Marcel. There, near a factory,\n",
      "and between two garden walls, there could be seen, at that epoch, a\n",
      "mean building, which, at the first glance, seemed as small as a\n",
      "thatched hovel, and which was, in reality, as large as a cathedral. It\n",
      "presented its side and gable to the public road; hence its apparent\n",
      "diminutiveness. Nearly the whole of the house was hidden. Only the door\n",
      "and one window could be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "This hovel was only one story high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first detail that struck the observer was, that the door could\n",
      "never have been anything but the door of a hovel, while the window, if\n",
      "it had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough\n",
      "masonry, might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door was nothing but a collection of worm-eaten planks roughly\n",
      "bound together by cross-beams which resembled roughly hewn logs. It\n",
      "opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps, muddy, chalky,\n",
      "plaster-stained, dusty steps, of the same width as itself, which could\n",
      "be seen from the street, running straight up like a ladder and\n",
      "disappearing in the darkness between two walls. The top of the\n",
      "shapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow\n",
      "scantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed,\n",
      "which served both as wicket and air-hole when the door was closed. On\n",
      "the inside of the door the figures 52 had been traced with a couple of\n",
      "strokes of a brush dipped in ink, and above the scantling the same hand\n",
      "had daubed the number 50, so that one hesitated. Where was one? Above\n",
      "the door it said, “Number 50”; the inside replied, “no, Number 52.” No\n",
      "one knows what dust-colored figures were suspended like draperies from\n",
      "the triangular opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "The window was large, sufficiently elevated, garnished with Venetian\n",
      "blinds, and with a frame in large square panes; only these large panes\n",
      "were suffering from various wounds, which were both concealed and\n",
      "betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage. And the blinds, dislocated and\n",
      "unpasted, threatened passers-by rather than screened the occupants. The\n",
      "horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naïvely\n",
      "replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly; so that what began as a\n",
      "blind ended as a shutter. This door with an unclean, and this window\n",
      "with an honest though dilapidated air, thus beheld on the same house,\n",
      "produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side,\n",
      "with different miens beneath the same rags, the one having always been\n",
      "a mendicant, and the other having once been a gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "The staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which\n",
      "had been converted into a house. This edifice had, for its intestinal\n",
      "tube, a long corridor, on which opened to right and left sorts of\n",
      "compartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stress\n",
      "of circumstances, and rather more like stalls than cells. These\n",
      "chambers received their light from the vague waste grounds in the\n",
      "neighborhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this was dark, disagreeable, wan, melancholy, sepulchral; traversed\n",
      "according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door, by cold rays\n",
      "or by icy winds. An interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this\n",
      "sort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the left of the entrance door, on the boulevard side, at about the\n",
      "height of a man from the ground, a small window which had been walled\n",
      "up formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown\n",
      "there as they passed by.\n",
      "\n",
      "A portion of this building has recently been demolished. From what\n",
      "still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former\n",
      "days. As a whole, it was not over a hundred years old. A hundred years\n",
      "is youth in a church and age in a house. It seems as though man’s\n",
      "lodging partook of his ephemeral character, and God’s house of his\n",
      "eternity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The postmen called the house Number 50-52; but it was known in the\n",
      "neighborhood as the Gorbeau house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us explain whence this appellation was derived.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collectors of petty details, who become herbalists of anecdotes, and\n",
      "prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin, know that there\n",
      "was in Paris, during the last century, about 1770, two attorneys at the\n",
      "Châtelet named, one Corbeau (Raven), the other Renard (Fox). The two\n",
      "names had been forestalled by La Fontaine. The opportunity was too fine\n",
      "for the lawyers; they made the most of it. A parody was immediately put\n",
      "in circulation in the galleries of the court-house, in verses that\n",
      "limped a little:—\n",
      "\n",
      "Maître Corbeau, sur un dossier perché,\n",
      "Tenait dans son bec une saisie exécutoire;\n",
      "Maître Renard, par l’odeur alléché,\n",
      "Lui fit à peu près cette histoire:\n",
      "Hé! bonjour.  Etc.13\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The two honest practitioners, embarrassed by the jests, and finding the\n",
      "bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which\n",
      "followed them, resolved to get rid of their names, and hit upon the\n",
      "expedient of applying to the king.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their petition was presented to Louis XV. on the same day when the\n",
      "Papal Nuncio, on the one hand, and the Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon on\n",
      "the other, both devoutly kneeling, were each engaged in putting on, in\n",
      "his Majesty’s presence, a slipper on the bare feet of Madame du Barry,\n",
      "who had just got out of bed. The king, who was laughing, continued to\n",
      "laugh, passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers, and\n",
      "bestowed on these limbs of the law their former names, or nearly so. By\n",
      "the kings command, Maître Corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his\n",
      "initial letter and to call himself Gorbeau. Maître Renard was less\n",
      "lucky; all he obtained was leave to place a P in front of his R, and to\n",
      "call himself Prenard; so that the second name bore almost as much\n",
      "resemblance as the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, according to local tradition, this Maître Gorbeau had been the\n",
      "proprietor of the building numbered 50-52 on the Boulevard de\n",
      "l’Hôpital. He was even the author of the monumental window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence the edifice bore the name of the Gorbeau house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opposite this house, among the trees of the boulevard, rose a great elm\n",
      "which was three-quarters dead; almost directly facing it opens the Rue\n",
      "de la Barrière des Gobelins, a street then without houses, unpaved,\n",
      "planted with unhealthy trees, which was green or muddy according to the\n",
      "season, and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of Paris. An odor\n",
      "of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The barrier was close at hand. In 1823 the city wall was still in\n",
      "existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "This barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind. It was the road\n",
      "to Bicêtre. It was through it that, under the Empire and the\n",
      "Restoration, prisoners condemned to death re-entered Paris on the day\n",
      "of their execution. It was there, that, about 1829, was committed that\n",
      "mysterious assassination, called “The assassination of the\n",
      "Fontainebleau barrier,” whose authors justice was never able to\n",
      "discover; a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated, a\n",
      "frightful enigma which has never been unriddled. Take a few steps, and\n",
      "you come upon that fatal Rue Croulebarbe, where Ulbach stabbed the\n",
      "goat-girl of Ivry to the sound of thunder, as in the melodramas. A few\n",
      "paces more, and you arrive at the abominable pollarded elms of the\n",
      "Barrière Saint-Jacques, that expedient of the philanthropist to conceal\n",
      "the scaffold, that miserable and shameful Place de Grève of a\n",
      "shop-keeping and bourgeois society, which recoiled before the death\n",
      "penalty, neither daring to abolish it with grandeur, nor to uphold it\n",
      "with authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaving aside this Place Saint-Jacques, which was, as it were,\n",
      "predestined, and which has always been horrible, probably the most\n",
      "mournful spot on that mournful boulevard, seven and thirty years ago,\n",
      "was the spot which even to-day is so unattractive, where stood the\n",
      "building Number 50-52.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty-five years later.\n",
      "The place was unpleasant. In addition to the gloomy thoughts which\n",
      "assailed one there, one was conscious of being between the Salpêtrière,\n",
      "a glimpse of whose dome could be seen, and Bicêtre, whose outskirts one\n",
      "was fairly touching; that is to say, between the madness of women and\n",
      "the madness of men. As far as the eye could see, one could perceive\n",
      "nothing but the abattoirs, the city wall, and the fronts of a few\n",
      "factories, resembling barracks or monasteries; everywhere about stood\n",
      "hovels, rubbish, ancient walls blackened like cerecloths, new white\n",
      "walls like winding-sheets; everywhere parallel rows of trees, buildings\n",
      "erected on a line, flat constructions, long, cold rows, and the\n",
      "melancholy sadness of right angles. Not an unevenness of the ground,\n",
      "not a caprice in the architecture, not a fold. The _ensemble_ was\n",
      "glacial, regular, hideous. Nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry.\n",
      "It is because symmetry is ennui, and ennui is at the very foundation of\n",
      "grief. Despair yawns. Something more terrible than a hell where one\n",
      "suffers may be imagined, and that is a hell where one is bored. If such\n",
      "a hell existed, that bit of the Boulevard de l’Hôpital might have\n",
      "formed the entrance to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, at nightfall, at the moment when the daylight is\n",
      "vanishing, especially in winter, at the hour when the twilight breeze\n",
      "tears from the elms their last russet leaves, when the darkness is deep\n",
      "and starless, or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the\n",
      "clouds and losing themselves in the shadows, this boulevard suddenly\n",
      "becomes frightful. The black lines sink inwards and are lost in the\n",
      "shades, like morsels of the infinite. The passer-by cannot refrain from\n",
      "recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected\n",
      "with the gibbet. The solitude of this spot, where so many crimes have\n",
      "been committed, had something terrible about it. One almost had a\n",
      "presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness; all the confused\n",
      "forms of the darkness seemed suspicious, and the long, hollow square,\n",
      "of which one caught a glimpse between each tree, seemed graves: by day\n",
      "it was ugly; in the evening melancholy; by night it was sinister.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summer, at twilight, one saw, here and there, a few old women seated\n",
      "at the foot of the elm, on benches mouldy with rain. These good old\n",
      "women were fond of begging.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this quarter, which had a superannuated rather than an antique\n",
      "air, was tending even then to transformation. Even at that time any one\n",
      "who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste. Each day some detail\n",
      "of the whole effect was disappearing. For the last twenty years the\n",
      "station of the Orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and\n",
      "distracted it, as it does to-day. Wherever it is placed on the borders\n",
      "of a capital, a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth\n",
      "of a city. It seems as though, around these great centres of the\n",
      "movements of a people, the earth, full of germs, trembled and yawned,\n",
      "to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring\n",
      "forth, at the rattle of these powerful machines, at the breath of these\n",
      "monstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire. The\n",
      "old houses crumble and new ones rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Orleans railway has invaded the region of the Salpêtrière,\n",
      "the ancient, narrow streets which adjoin the moats Saint-Victor and the\n",
      "Jardin des Plantes tremble, as they are violently traversed three or\n",
      "four times each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses\n",
      "which, in a given time, crowd back the houses to the right and the\n",
      "left; for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously\n",

      "He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket, drew out a sort of a pass-key,\n",

      "furnished with a mattress laid on the floor, a table, and several\n",
      "chairs; a stove in which a fire was burning, and whose embers were\n",
      "visible, stood in one corner. A lantern on the boulevard cast a vague\n",

      "He struck a match and lighted a candle. All this was prepared\n",

      "he began to scrutinize Cosette’s face with a gaze full of ecstasy, in\n",
      "which the expression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted to\n",

      "and shy. The heart of that ex-convict was full of virginity. His sister\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The early days passed in this dazzled state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette, on her side, had also, unknown to herself, become another\n",

      "that she no longer remembered her. Like all children, who resemble\n",
      "young shoots of the vine, which cling to everything, she had tried to\n",
      "love; she had not succeeded. All had repulsed her,—the Thénardiers,\n",

      "after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her. It\n",
      "is a sad thing to say, and we have already intimated it, that, at eight\n",
      "years of age, her heart was cold. It was not her fault; it was not the\n",
      "faculty of loving that she lacked; alas! it was the possibility. Thus,\n",
      "from the very first day, all her sentient and thinking powers loved\n",

      "sensation of expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor; she\n",

      "These are the effects of the dawn, of childhood, of joy. The novelty of\n",

      "say that, separated from every one by the walls of the tomb, Jean\n",
      "Valjean was the widower, and Cosette was the orphan: this situation\n",
      "caused Jean Valjean to become Cosette’s father after a celestial\n",

      "have said, numerous chambers and several attics, only one of which was\n",
      "occupied by the old woman who took charge of Jean Valjean’s\n",
      "housekeeping; all the rest was uninhabited.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was this old woman, ornamented with the name of the _principal\n",
      "lodger_, and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress, who\n",
      "had let him the lodging on Christmas eve. He had represented himself to\n",
      "her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by Spanish bonds, who\n",
      "was coming there to live with his little daughter. He had paid her six\n",
      "months in advance, and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the\n",
      "chamber and dressing-room, as we have seen. It was this good woman who\n",
      "had lighted the fire in the stove, and prepared everything on the\n",

      "\n",
      "It sometimes happened that Jean Valjean clasped her tiny red hand, all\n",

      "confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "At times she became serious and stared at her little black gown.\n",

      "\n",

      "the child spell, he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil\n",
      "that he had learned to read in prison. This idea had ended in teaching\n",
      "a child to read. Then the ex-convict smiled with the pensive smile of\n",
      "the angels.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt in it a premeditation from on high, the will of some one who\n",
      "was not man, and he became absorbed in reverie. Good thoughts have\n",
      "their abysses as well as evil ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "To teach Cosette to read, and to let her play, this constituted nearly\n",
      "the whole of Jean Valjean’s existence. And then he talked of her\n",
      "mother, and he made her pray.\n",
      "\n",
      "She called him _father_, and knew no other name for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll, and\n",
      "in listening to her prattle. Life, henceforth, appeared to him to be\n",
      "full of interest; men seemed to him good and just; he no longer\n",
      "reproached any one in thought; he saw no reason why he should not live\n",
      "to be a very old man, now that this child loved him. He saw a whole\n",
      "future stretching out before him, illuminated by Cosette as by a\n",
      "charming light. The best of us are not exempt from egotistical\n",
      "thoughts. At times, he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be\n",
      "ugly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is only a personal opinion; but, to utter our whole thought, at\n",
      "the point where Jean Valjean had arrived when he began to love Cosette,\n",
      "it is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement\n",
      "in order that he might persevere in well-doing. He had just viewed the\n",
      "malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect—incomplete\n",
      "aspects, which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth, the\n",
      "fate of woman as summed up in Fantine, and public authority as\n",
      "personified in Javert. He had returned to prison, this time for having\n",
      "done right; he had quaffed fresh bitterness; disgust and lassitude were\n",
      "overpowering him; even the memory of the Bishop probably suffered a\n",
      "temporary eclipse, though sure to reappear later on luminous and\n",
      "triumphant; but, after all, that sacred memory was growing dim. Who\n",
      "knows whether Jean Valjean had not been on the eve of growing\n",
      "discouraged and of falling once more? He loved and grew strong again.\n",
      "Alas! he walked with no less indecision than Cosette. He protected her,\n",
      "and she strengthened him. Thanks to him, she could walk through life;\n",
      "thanks to her, he could continue in virtue. He was that child’s stay,\n",

      "entering churches at nightfall. He liked to go to Saint-Médard, which\n",

      "accepted the sou with a deep bow. It also happened occasionally that he\n",

      "make sure that no one was observing him, stealthily approached the\n",
      "unfortunate man, put a piece of money into his hand, often a silver\n",

      "inquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons, scrutinized Jean Valjean a\n",
      "great deal, without his suspecting the fact. She was a little deaf,\n",
      "which rendered her talkative. There remained to her from her past, two\n",

      "of an old cat, and was able to observe him without being seen, through\n",
      "a crack in the door, which was directly opposite him. Jean Valjean had\n",
      "his back turned towards this door, by way of greater security, no\n",
      "doubt. The old woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence a\n",
      "case, scissors, and thread; then he began to rip the lining of one of\n",
      "the skirts of his coat, and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish\n",
      "paper, which he unfolded. The old woman recognized, with terror, the\n",
      "fact that it was a bank-bill for a thousand francs. It was the second\n",
      "or third only that she had seen in the course of her existence. She\n",
      "fled in alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "A moment later, Jean Valjean accosted her, and asked her to go and get\n",
      "this thousand-franc bill changed for him, adding that it was his\n",
      "quarterly income, which he had received the day before. “Where?”\n",
      "thought the old woman. “He did not go out until six o’clock in the\n",

      "admiring the wood as it was sawed. The old woman caught sight of the\n",

      "again. The good woman felt of it carefully, and thought she observed in\n",

      "word. The beggar had the same figure, the same rags, the same\n",
      "appearance as he had every day. “Bah!” said Jean Valjean, “I am mad! I\n",
      "am dreaming! Impossible!” And he returned profoundly troubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hardly dared to confess, even to himself, that the face which he\n",
      "thought he had seen was the face of Javert.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night, on thinking the matter over, he regretted not having\n",
      "questioned the man, in order to force him to raise his head a second\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the following day, at nightfall, he went back. The beggar was at his\n",
      "post. “Good day, my good man,” said Jean Valjean, resolutely, handing\n",
      "him a sou. The beggar raised his head, and replied in a whining voice,\n",
      "“Thanks, my good sir.” It was unmistakably the ex-beadle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean felt completely reassured. He began to laugh. “How the\n",
      "deuce could I have thought that I saw Javert there?” he thought. “Am I\n",
      "going to lose my eyesight now?” And he thought no more about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days afterwards,—it might have been at eight o’clock in the\n",
      "evening,—he was in his room, and engaged in making Cosette spell aloud,\n",
      "when he heard the house door open and then shut again. This struck him\n",
      "as singular. The old woman, who was the only inhabitant of the house\n",
      "except himself, always went to bed at nightfall, so that she might not\n",
      "burn out her candles. Jean Valjean made a sign to Cosette to be quiet.\n",
      "He heard some one ascending the stairs. It might possibly be the old\n",
      "woman, who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecary’s.\n",
      "Jean Valjean listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The step was heavy, and sounded like that of a man; but the old woman\n",
      "wore stout shoes, and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the\n",
      "step of a man as that of an old woman. Nevertheless, Jean Valjean blew\n",
      "out his candle.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had sent Cosette to bed, saying to her in a low voice, “Get into bed\n",
      "very softly”; and as he kissed her brow, the steps paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean remained silent, motionless, with his back towards the\n",
      "door, seated on the chair from which he had not stirred, and holding\n",
      "his breath in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the expiration of a rather long interval, he turned round, as he\n",
      "heard nothing more, and, as he raised his eyes towards the door of his\n",
      "chamber, he saw a light through the keyhole. This light formed a sort\n",
      "of sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall. There was\n",
      "evidently some one there, who was holding a candle in his hand and\n",
      "listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several minutes elapsed thus, and the light retreated. But he heard no\n",
      "sound of footsteps, which seemed to indicate that the person who had\n",
      "been listening at the door had removed his shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean threw himself, all dressed as he was, on his bed, and\n",
      "could not close his eyes all night.\n",
      "\n",
      "At daybreak, just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue, he was\n",
      "awakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the\n",
      "end of the corridor, then he heard the same masculine footstep which\n",
      "had ascended the stairs on the preceding evening. The step was\n",
      "approaching. He sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole,\n",
      "which was tolerably large, hoping to see the person who had made his\n",
      "way by night into the house and had listened at his door, as he passed.\n",
      "It was a man, in fact, who passed, this time without pausing, in front\n",
      "of Jean Valjean’s chamber. The corridor was too dark to allow of the\n",
      "person’s face being distinguished; but when the man reached the\n",
      "staircase, a ray of light from without made it stand out like a\n",
      "silhouette, and Jean Valjean had a complete view of his back. The man\n",
      "was of lofty stature, clad in a long frock-coat, with a cudgel under\n",
      "his arm. The formidable neck and shoulders belonged to Javert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him\n",
      "through his window opening on the boulevard, but he would have been\n",
      "obliged to open the window: he dared not.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was evident that this man had entered with a key, and like himself.\n",
      "Who had given him that key? What was the meaning of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "When the old woman came to do the work, at seven o’clock in the\n",
      "morning, Jean Valjean cast a penetrating glance on her, but he did not\n",
      "question her. The good woman appeared as usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she swept up she remarked to him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Possibly Monsieur may have heard some one come in last night?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At that age, and on that boulevard, eight o’clock in the evening was\n",
      "the dead of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true, by the way,” he replied, in the most natural tone\n",
      "possible. “Who was it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a new lodger who has come into the house,” said the old woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what is his name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know exactly; Dumont, or Daumont, or some name of that sort.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who is this Monsieur Dumont?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes, and answered:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“A gentleman of property, like yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps she had no ulterior meaning. Jean Valjean thought he perceived\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the old woman had taken her departure, he did up a hundred francs\n",
      "which he had in a cupboard, into a roll, and put it in his pocket. In\n",
      "spite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that he\n",
      "might not be heard rattling silver, a hundred-sou piece escaped from\n",
      "his hands and rolled noisily on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "When darkness came on, he descended and carefully scrutinized both\n",
      "sides of the boulevard. He saw no one. The boulevard appeared to be\n",
      "absolutely deserted. It is true that a person can conceal himself\n",
      "behind trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went upstairs again.\n",

      "The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning\n",
      "himself, has been absent from Paris for many years. Paris has been\n",
      "transformed since he quitted it. A new city has arisen, which is, after\n",
      "a fashion, unknown to him. There is no need for him to say that he\n",
      "loves Paris: Paris is his mind’s natal city. In consequence of\n",
      "demolitions and reconstructions, the Paris of his youth, that Paris\n",
      "which he bore away religiously in his memory, is now a Paris of days\n",
      "gone by. He must be permitted to speak of that Paris as though it still\n",
      "existed. It is possible that when the author conducts his readers to a\n",
      "spot and says, “In such a street there stands such and such a house,”\n",
      "neither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality.\n",
      "Readers may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble. For his\n",
      "own part, he is unacquainted with the new Paris, and he writes with the\n",
      "old Paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him. It\n",
      "is a delight to him to dream that there still lingers behind him\n",
      "something of that which he beheld when he was in his own country, and\n",
      "that all has not vanished. So long as you go and come in your native\n",
      "land, you imagine that those streets are a matter of indifference to\n",
      "you; that those windows, those roofs, and those doors are nothing to\n",
      "you; that those walls are strangers to you; that those trees are merely\n",
      "the first encountered haphazard; that those houses, which you do not\n",
      "enter, are useless to you; that the pavements which you tread are\n",
      "merely stones. Later on, when you are no longer there, you perceive\n",
      "that the streets are dear to you; that you miss those roofs, those\n",
      "doors; and that those walls are necessary to you, those trees are well\n",
      "beloved by you; that you entered those houses which you never entered,\n",
      "every day, and that you have left a part of your heart, of your blood,\n",
      "of your soul, in those pavements. All those places which you no longer\n",
      "behold, which you may never behold again, perchance, and whose memory\n",
      "you have cherished, take on a melancholy charm, recur to your mind with\n",
      "the melancholy of an apparition, make the holy land visible to you, and\n",

      "call them up as they are, as they were, and you persist in this, and\n",

      "moon, still very close to the horizon, cast great masses of light and\n",
      "shadow in the streets. Jean Valjean could glide along close to the\n",
      "houses on the dark side, and yet keep watch on the light side. He did\n",
      "not, perhaps, take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the\n",
      "dark side escaped him. Still, in the deserted lanes which lie near the\n",
      "Rue Poliveau, he thought he felt certain that no one was following him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette walked on without asking any questions. The sufferings of the\n",
      "first six years of her life had instilled something passive into her\n",

      "have occasion to recur,—she had grown used, without being herself aware\n",
      "of it, to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks of\n",
      "destiny. And then she was with him, and she felt safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean knew no more where he was going than did Cosette. He\n",
      "trusted in God, as she trusted in him. It seemed as though he also were\n",
      "clinging to the hand of some one greater than himself; he thought he\n",
      "felt a being leading him, though invisible. However, he had no settled\n",
      "idea, no plan, no project. He was not even absolutely sure that it was\n",
      "Javert, and then it might have been Javert, without Javert knowing that\n",
      "he was Jean Valjean. Was not he disguised? Was not he believed to be\n",
      "dead? Still, queer things had been going on for several days. He wanted\n",
      "no more of them. He was determined not to return to the Gorbeau house.\n",

      "which he might hide until he could find one where he might dwell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the Mouffetard\n",
      "quarter, which was already asleep, as though the discipline of the\n",
      "Middle Ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed; he combined in\n",
      "various manners, with cunning strategy, the Rue Censier and the Rue\n",
      "Copeau, the Rue du Battoir-Saint-Victor and the Rue du Puits l’Ermite.\n",
      "There are lodging houses in this locality, but he did not even enter\n",

      "had chanced to be upon his track, they would have lost it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As eleven o’clock struck from Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, he was traversing\n",
      "the Rue de Pontoise, in front of the office of the commissary of\n",
      "police, situated at No. 14. A few moments later, the instinct of which\n",
      "we have spoken above made him turn round. At that moment he saw\n",
      "distinctly, thanks to the commissary’s lantern, which betrayed them,\n",
      "three men who were following him closely, pass, one after the other,\n",
      "under that lantern, on the dark side of the street. One of the three\n",
      "entered the alley leading to the commissary’s house. The one who\n",
      "marched at their head struck him as decidedly suspicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, child,” he said to Cosette; and he made haste to quit the Rue\n",
      "Pontoise.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took a circuit, turned into the Passage des Patriarches, which was\n",
      "closed on account of the hour, strode along the Rue de l’Épée-de-Bois\n",
      "and the Rue de l’Arbalète, and plunged into the Rue des Postes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time there was a square formed by the intersection of streets,\n",
      "where the College Rollin stands to-day, and where the Rue\n",
      "Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève turns off.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is understood, of course, that the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève is an\n",
      "old street, and that a posting-chaise does not pass through the Rue des\n",
      "Postes once in ten years. In the thirteenth century this Rue des Postes\n",
      "was inhabited by potters, and its real name is Rue des Pots.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moon cast a livid light into this open space. Jean Valjean went\n",
      "into ambush in a doorway, calculating that if the men were still\n",
      "following him, he could not fail to get a good look at them, as they\n",
      "traversed this illuminated space.\n",
      "\n",
      "In point of fact, three minutes had not elapsed when the men made their\n",
      "appearance. There were four of them now. All were tall, dressed in\n",
      "long, brown coats, with round hats, and huge cudgels in their hands.\n",
      "Their great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming\n",
      "than did their sinister stride through the darkness. One would have\n",
      "pronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois.\n",
      "\n",
      "They halted in the middle of the space and formed a group, like men in\n",
      "consultation. They had an air of indecision. The one who appeared to be\n",
      "their leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in\n",
      "the direction which Jean Valjean had taken; another seemed to indicate\n",
      "the contrary direction with considerable obstinacy. At the moment when\n",

      "had concealed himself, and went down the Rue des Postes, towards the\n",
      "region of the Jardin des Plantes. Cosette was beginning to be tired. He\n",

      "\n",
      "A little street, the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, opened out\n",
      "between two timber-yards enclosed in walls. This street was dark and\n",

      "nothing; the silence was profound, and he continued his march somewhat\n",
      "reassured. All at once, on turning round, he thought he perceived in\n",
      "the portion of the street which he had just passed through, far off in\n",
      "the obscurity, something which was moving.\n",

      "\n",
      "He arrived at a wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "This wall, however, did not absolutely prevent further progress; it was\n",

      "taken ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here again, he was obliged to come to a decision; should he go to the\n",
      "right or to the left.\n",
      "\n",
      "He glanced to the right. The fragmentary lane was prolonged between\n",
      "buildings which were either sheds or barns, then ended at a blind\n",
      "alley. The extremity of the cul-de-sac was distinctly visible,—a lofty\n",
      "white wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "He glanced to the left. On that side the lane was open, and about two\n",
      "hundred paces further on, ran into a street of which it was the\n",
      "affluent. On that side lay safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment when Jean Valjean was meditating a turn to the left, in\n",
      "an effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane, he\n",
      "perceived a sort of motionless, black statue at the corner of the lane\n",
      "and the street towards which he was on the point of directing his\n",
      "steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was some one, a man, who had evidently just been posted there, and\n",

      "The point of Paris where Jean Valjean found himself, situated between\n",

      "disfigurement according to some, and in a transfiguration according to\n",
      "others. The market-gardens, the timber-yards, and the old buildings\n",
      "have been effaced. To-day, there are brand-new, wide streets, arenas,\n",

      "Le Petit-Picpus, which, moreover, hardly ever had any existence, and\n",
      "never was more than the outline of a quarter, had nearly the monkish\n",
      "aspect of a Spanish town. The roads were not much paved; the streets\n",
      "were not much built up. With the exception of the two or three streets,\n",
      "of which we shall presently speak, all was wall and solitude there. Not\n",
      "a shop, not a vehicle, hardly a candle lighted here and there in the\n",

      "was disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings. To-day, it\n",
      "has been utterly blotted out. The Petit-Picpus, of which no existing\n",

      "Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, which spread out in two branches, taking on\n",
      "the left the name of Little Picpus Street, and on the right the name of\n",
      "the Rue Polonceau. The two limbs of the Y were connected at the apex as\n",
      "by a bar; this bar was called Rue Droit-Mur. The Rue Polonceau ended\n",
      "there; Rue Petit-Picpus passed on, and ascended towards the Lenoir\n",
      "market. A person coming from the Seine reached the extremity of the Rue\n",
      "Polonceau, and had on his right the Rue Droit-Mur, turning abruptly at\n",
      "a right angle, in front of him the wall of that street, and on his\n",

      "of the street at whose end Jean Valjean stood. Javert, to all\n",
      "appearances, was acquainted with this little labyrinth, and had taken\n",
      "his precautions by sending one of his men to guard the exit. These\n",
      "surmises, which so closely resembled proofs, whirled suddenly, like a\n",
      "handful of dust caught up by an unexpected gust of wind, through Jean\n",
      "Valjean’s mournful brain. He examined the Cul-de-Sac Genrot; there he\n",
      "was cut off. He examined the Rue Petit-Picpus; there stood a sentinel.\n",
      "He saw that black form standing out in relief against the white\n",
      "pavement, illuminated by the moon; to advance was to fall into this\n",
      "man’s hands; to retreat was to fling himself into Javert’s arms. Jean\n",

      "In order to understand what follows, it is requisite to form an exact\n",
      "idea of the Droit-Mur lane, and, in particular, of the angle which one\n",
      "leaves on the left when one emerges from the Rue Polonceau into this\n",
      "lane. Droit-Mur lane was almost entirely bordered on the right, as far\n",
      "as the Rue Petit-Picpus, by houses of mean aspect; on the left by a\n",
      "solitary building of severe outlines, composed of numerous parts which\n",
      "grew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the Rue\n",
      "Petit-Picpus side; so that this building, which was very lofty on the\n",
      "Rue Petit-Picpus side, was tolerably low on the side adjoining the Rue\n",
      "Polonceau. There, at the angle of which we have spoken, it descended to\n",
      "such a degree that it consisted of merely a wall. This wall did not\n",
      "abut directly on the street; it formed a deeply retreating niche,\n",
      "concealed by its two corners from two observers who might have been,\n",
      "one in the Rue Polonceau, the other in the Rue Droit-Mur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beginning with these angles of the niche, the wall extended along the\n",
      "Rue Polonceau as far as a house which bore the number 49, and along the\n",
      "Rue Droit-Mur, where the fragment was much shorter, as far as the\n",
      "gloomy building which we have mentioned and whose gable it intersected,\n",
      "thus forming another retreating angle in the street. This gable was\n",
      "sombre of aspect; only one window was visible, or, to speak more\n",
      "correctly, two shutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept\n",
      "constantly closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The state of the places of which we are here giving a description is\n",
      "rigorously exact, and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in\n",
      "the mind of old inhabitants of the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal and\n",
      "wretched door; it was a vast, formless assemblage of perpendicular\n",
      "planks, the upper ones being broader than the lower, bound together by\n",
      "long transverse strips of iron. At one side there was a carriage gate\n",
      "of the ordinary dimensions, and which had evidently not been cut more\n",
      "than fifty years previously.\n",
      "\n",
      "A linden-tree showed its crest above the niche, and the wall was\n",
      "covered with ivy on the side of the Rue Polonceau.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the imminent peril in which Jean Valjean found himself, this sombre\n",
      "building had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted\n",
      "him. He ran his eyes rapidly over it; he said to himself, that if he\n",
      "could contrive to get inside it, he might save himself. First he\n",
      "conceived an idea, then a hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the central portion of the front of this building, on the Rue\n",
      "Droit-Mur side, there were at all the windows of the different stories\n",
      "ancient cistern pipes of lead. The various branches of the pipes which\n",
      "led from one central pipe to all these little basins sketched out a\n",
      "sort of tree on the front. These ramifications of pipes with their\n",
      "hundred elbows imitated those old leafless vine-stocks which writhe\n",
      "over the fronts of old farm-houses.\n",
      "\n",
      "This odd espalier, with its branches of lead and iron, was the first\n",
      "thing that struck Jean Valjean. He seated Cosette with her back against\n",
      "a stone post, with an injunction to be silent, and ran to the spot\n",
      "where the conduit touched the pavement. Perhaps there was some way of\n",
      "climbing up by it and entering the house. But the pipe was dilapidated\n",
      "and past service, and hardly hung to its fastenings. Moreover, all the\n",
      "windows of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars, even\n",
      "the attic windows in the roof. And then, the moon fell full upon that\n",
      "façade, and the man who was watching at the corner of the street would\n",
      "have seen Jean Valjean in the act of climbing. And finally, what was to\n",
      "be done with Cosette? How was she to be drawn up to the top of a\n",
      "three-story house?\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain-pipe, and crawled\n",
      "along the wall to get back into the Rue Polonceau.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached the slant of the wall where he had left Cosette, he\n",
      "noticed that no one could see him there. As we have just explained, he\n",
      "was concealed from all eyes, no matter from which direction they were\n",
      "approaching; besides this, he was in the shadow. Finally, there were\n",
      "two doors; perhaps they might be forced. The wall above which he saw\n",
      "the linden-tree and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where he\n",
      "could, at least, hide himself, although there were as yet no leaves on\n",
      "the trees, and spend the remainder of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time was passing; he must act quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt over the carriage door, and immediately recognized the fact\n",
      "that it was impracticable outside and in.\n",
      "\n",
      "He approached the other door with more hope; it was frightfully\n",
      "decrepit; its very immensity rendered it less solid; the planks were\n",
      "rotten; the iron bands—there were only three of them—were rusted. It\n",
      "seemed as though it might be possible to pierce this worm-eaten\n",
      "barrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "On examining it he found that the door was not a door; it had neither\n",
      "hinges, cross-bars, lock, nor fissure in the middle; the iron bands\n",
      "traversed it from side to side without any break. Through the crevices\n",
      "in the planks he caught a view of unhewn slabs and blocks of stone\n",
      "roughly cemented together, which passers-by might still have seen there\n",
      "ten years ago. He was forced to acknowledge with consternation that\n",
      "this apparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building\n",
      "against which it was placed. It was easy to tear off a plank; but then,\n",
      "one found one’s self face to face with a wall.\n",

      "At that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at some\n",
      "distance. Jean Valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street.\n",
      "Seven or eight soldiers, drawn up in a platoon, had just debouched into\n",
      "the Rue Polonceau. He saw the gleam of their bayonets. They were\n",
      "advancing towards him; these soldiers, at whose head he distinguished\n",
      "Javert’s tall figure, advanced slowly and cautiously. They halted\n",
      "frequently; it was plain that they were searching all the nooks of the\n",
      "walls and all the embrasures of the doors and alleys.\n",

      "hour to reach the spot where Jean Valjean stood. It was a frightful\n",
      "moment. A few minutes only separated Jean Valjean from that terrible\n",
      "precipice which yawned before him for the third time. And the galleys\n",
      "now meant not only the galleys, but Cosette lost to him forever; that\n",
      "is to say, a life resembling the interior of a tomb.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was but one thing which was possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean had this peculiarity, that he carried, as one might say,\n",
      "two beggar’s pouches: in one he kept his saintly thoughts; in the other\n",
      "the redoubtable talents of a convict. He rummaged in the one or the\n",
      "other, according to circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among his other resources, thanks to his numerous escapes from the\n",
      "prison at Toulon, he was, as it will be remembered, a past master in\n",
      "the incredible art of crawling up without ladder or climbing-irons, by\n",
      "sheer muscular force, by leaning on the nape of his neck, his\n",
      "shoulders, his hips, and his knees, by helping himself on the rare\n",
      "projections of the stone, in the right angle of a wall, as high as the\n",

      "extremity, by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape, probably\n",
      "intended to preserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of\n",
      "those dirty creatures called the passers-by. This practice of filling\n",
      "up corners of the wall is much in use in Paris.\n",
      "\n",

      "The wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette was the difficulty, for she did not know how to climb a wall.\n",
      "Should he abandon her? Jean Valjean did not once think of that. It was\n",
      "impossible to carry her. A man’s whole strength is required to\n",
      "successfully carry out these singular ascents. The least burden would\n",
      "disturb his centre of gravity and pull him downwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "A rope would have been required; Jean Valjean had none. Where was he to\n",

      "blind alley Genrot.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that epoch there were no gas-jets in the streets of Paris. At\n",
      "nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted; they were\n",
      "ascended and descended by means of a rope, which traversed the street\n",
      "from side to side, and was adjusted in a groove of the post. The pulley\n",
      "over which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a\n",
      "little iron box, the key to which was kept by the lamp-lighter, and the\n",
      "rope itself was protected by a metal case.\n",
      "\n",

      "box with the point of his knife, and an instant later he was beside\n",

      "work rapidly when they are fighting against fatality.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted that\n",

      "and curt precision, the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and\n",
      "Javert might come upon him at any moment, he undid his cravat, passed\n",
      "it round Cosette’s body under the armpits, taking care that it should\n",
      "not hurt the child, fastened this cravat to one end of the rope, by\n",
      "means of that knot which seafaring men call a “swallow knot,” took the\n",
      "other end of the rope in his teeth, pulled off his shoes and stockings,\n",
      "which he threw over the wall, stepped upon the mass of masonry, and\n",
      "began to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with as\n",
      "much solidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladder\n",
      "under his feet and elbows. Half a minute had not elapsed when he was\n",
      "resting on his knees on the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement, without uttering a word. Jean\n",
      "Valjean’s injunction, and the name of Madame Thénardier, had chilled\n",
      "her blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once she heard Jean Valjean’s voice crying to her, though in a\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Don’t say a word, and don’t be alarmed,” went on Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Before she had time to recover herself, she was on the top of the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean grasped her, put her on his back, took her two tiny hands\n",
      "in his large left hand, lay down flat on his stomach and crawled along\n",
      "on top of the wall as far as the cant. As he had guessed, there stood a\n",
      "building whose roof started from the top of the wooden barricade and\n",
      "descended to within a very short distance of the ground, with a gentle\n",
      "slope which grazed the linden-tree. A lucky circumstance, for the wall\n",
      "was much higher on this side than on the street side. Jean Valjean\n",
      "could only see the ground at a great depth below him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had just reached the slope of the roof, and had not yet left the\n",
      "crest of the wall, when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the\n",

      "of singular aspect; one of those melancholy gardens which seem made to\n",
      "be looked at in winter and at night. This garden was oblong in shape,\n",
      "with an alley of large poplars at the further end, tolerably tall\n",
      "forest trees in the corners, and an unshaded space in the centre, where\n",
      "could be seen a very large, solitary tree, then several fruit-trees,\n",
      "gnarled and bristling like bushes, beds of vegetables, a melon patch,\n",
      "whose glass frames sparkled in the moonlight, and an old well. Here and\n",
      "there stood stone benches which seemed black with moss. The alleys were\n",
      "bordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs. The grass had half\n",
      "taken possession of them, and a green mould covered the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as a\n",
      "means of descent, a pile of fagots, and, behind the fagots, directly\n",
      "against the wall, a stone statue, whose mutilated face was no longer\n",
      "anything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through the\n",
      "gloom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The building was a sort of ruin, where dismantled chambers were\n",
      "distinguishable, one of which, much encumbered, seemed to serve as a\n",
      "shed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The large building of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had a wing on the Rue\n",
      "Petit-Picpus, turned two façades, at right angles, towards this garden.\n",
      "These interior façades were even more tragic than the exterior. All the\n",
      "windows were grated. Not a gleam of light was visible at any one of\n",
      "them. The upper story had scuttles like prisons. One of those façades\n",
      "cast its shadow on the other, which fell over the garden like an\n",
      "immense black pall.\n",
      "\n",
      "No other house was visible. The bottom of the garden was lost in mist\n",
      "and darkness. Nevertheless, walls could be confusedly made out, which\n",
      "intersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond, and the\n",
      "low roofs of the Rue Polonceau.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined.\n",
      "There was no one in it, which was quite natural in view of the hour;\n",

      "in, even in broad daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean’s first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put\n",
      "them on again, then to step under the shed with Cosette. A man who is\n",
      "fleeing never thinks himself sufficiently hidden. The child, whose\n",
      "thoughts were still on the Thénardier, shared his instinct for\n",
      "withdrawing from sight as much as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette trembled and pressed close to him. They heard the tumultuous\n",
      "noise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets; the\n",
      "blows of their gun-stocks against the stones; Javert’s appeals to the\n",
      "police spies whom he had posted, and his imprecations mingled with\n",
      "words which could not be distinguished.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that\n",
      "species of stormy roar were becoming more distant. Jean Valjean held\n",
      "his breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had laid his hand lightly on Cosette’s mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm, that\n",

      "walls had been built of the deaf stones of which the Scriptures speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once, in the midst of this profound calm, a fresh sound arose; a\n",
      "sound as celestial, divine, ineffable, ravishing, as the other had been\n",
      "horrible. It was a hymn which issued from the gloom, a dazzling burst\n",
      "of prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night;\n",
      "women’s voices, but voices composed at one and the same time of the\n",
      "pure accents of virgins and the innocent accents of children,—voices\n",
      "which are not of the earth, and which resemble those that the newborn\n",
      "infant still hears, and which the dying man hears already. This song\n",
      "proceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden. At\n",
      "the moment when the hubbub of demons retreated, one would have said\n",
      "that a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "they must kneel.\n",
      "\n",
      "These voices had this strange characteristic, that they did not prevent\n",
      "the building from seeming to be deserted. It was a supernatural chant\n",
      "in an uninhabited house.\n",
      "\n",
      "While these voices were singing, Jean Valjean thought of nothing. He no\n",
      "longer beheld the night; he beheld a blue sky. It seemed to him that he\n",

      "\n",
      "The song died away. It may have lasted a long time. Jean Valjean could\n",

      "\n",
      "All fell silent again. There was no longer anything in the street;\n",
      "there was nothing in the garden. That which had menaced, that which had\n",
      "reassured him,—all had vanished. The breeze swayed a few dry weeds on\n",

      "better shelter. He came across doors, but they were closed. There were\n",
      "bars at all the windows of the ground floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice, he observed\n",
      "that he was coming to some arched windows, where he perceived a light.\n",
      "He stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows. They all\n",
      "opened on a tolerably vast hall, paved with large flagstones, cut up by\n",

      "Nevertheless, by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived on the\n",
      "ground something which appeared to be covered with a winding-sheet, and\n",
      "which resembled a human form. This form was lying face downward, flat\n",
      "on the pavement, with the arms extended in the form of a cross, in the\n",
      "immobility of death. One would have said, judging from a sort of\n",
      "serpent which undulated over the floor, that this sinister form had a\n",
      "rope round its neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are sparely\n",
      "illuminated, which adds to horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean often said afterwards, that, although many funereal\n",
      "spectres had crossed his path in life, he had never beheld anything\n",
      "more blood-curdling and terrible than that enigmatical form\n",
      "accomplishing some inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place, and\n",
      "beheld thus at night. It was alarming to suppose that that thing was\n",
      "perhaps dead; and still more alarming to think that it was perhaps\n",
      "alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had the courage to plaster his face to the glass, and to watch\n",
      "whether the thing would move. In spite of his remaining thus what\n",
      "seemed to him a very long time, the outstretched form made no movement.\n",
      "All at once he felt himself overpowered by an inexpressible terror, and\n",
      "he fled. He began to run towards the shed, not daring to look behind\n",
      "him. It seemed to him, that if he turned his head, he should see that\n",
      "form following him with great strides and waving its arms.\n",

      "abruptly that terrible vision; promising to open the radiant portals of\n",
      "heaven, and then opening the horrible gates of the tomb! And it\n",
      "actually was an edifice, a house, which bore a number on the street! It\n",

      "\n",
      "He clearly perceived this truth, the foundation of his life henceforth,\n",
      "that so long as she was there, so long as he had her near him, he\n",

      "bell. This sound proceeded from the garden. It could be heard\n",
      "distinctly though faintly. It resembled the faint, vague music produced\n",
      "by the bells of cattle at night in the pastures.\n",
      "\n",
      "This noise made Valjean turn round.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked and saw that there was some one in the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "A being resembling a man was walking amid the bell-glasses of the melon\n",
      "beds, rising, stooping, halting, with regular movements, as though he\n",
      "were dragging or spreading out something on the ground. This person\n",
      "appeared to limp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy. For\n",
      "them everything is hostile and suspicious. They distrust the day\n",
      "because it enables people to see them, and the night because it aids in\n",
      "surprising them. A little while before he had shivered because the\n",
      "garden was deserted, and now he shivered because there was some one\n",
      "there.\n",
      "\n",
      "He fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors. He said to\n",
      "himself that Javert and the spies had, perhaps, not taken their\n",
      "departure; that they had, no doubt, left people on the watch in the\n",
      "street; that if this man should discover him in the garden, he would\n",
      "cry out for help against thieves and deliver him up. He took the\n",
      "sleeping Cosette gently in his arms and carried her behind a heap of\n",
      "old furniture, which was out of use, in the most remote corner of the\n",
      "shed. Cosette did not stir.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melon\n",
      "patch. The strange thing about it was, that the sound of the bell\n",
      "followed each of this man’s movements. When the man approached, the\n",
      "sound approached; when the man retreated, the sound retreated; if he\n",
      "made any hasty gesture, a tremolo accompanied the gesture; when he\n",
      "halted, the sound ceased. It appeared evident that the bell was\n",
      "attached to that man; but what could that signify? Who was this man who\n",
      "had a bell suspended about him like a ram or an ox?\n",
      "\n",
      "As he put these questions to himself, he touched Cosette’s hands. They\n",
      "were icy cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! good God!” he cried.\n",

      "She did not open her eyes.\n",

      "\n",
      "She did not wake.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is she dead?” he said to himself, and sprang to his feet, quivering\n",

      "How was he to warm her back to life? How was he to rouse her? All that\n",

      "\n",
      "He had expected anything but that. The person who thus addressed him\n",
      "was a bent and lame old man, dressed almost like a peasant, who wore on\n",
      "his left knee a leather knee-cap, whence hung a moderately large bell.\n",
      "His face, which was in the shadow, was not distinguishable.\n",

      "However, the goodman had removed his cap, and exclaimed, trembling all\n",
      "over:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, good God! How come you here, Father Madeleine? Where did you\n",
      "enter? Dieu-Jésus! Did you fall from heaven? There is no trouble about\n",
      "that: if ever you do fall, it will be from there. And what a state you\n",
      "are in! You have no cravat; you have no hat; you have no coat! Do you\n",
      "know, you would have frightened any one who did not know you? No coat!\n",

      "here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "His words tumbled over each other. The goodman talked with a rustic\n",
      "volubility, in which there was nothing alarming. All this was uttered\n",
      "with a mixture of stupefaction and _naïve_ kindliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are you? and what house is this?” demanded Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! pardieu, this is too much!” exclaimed the old man. “I am the\n",
      "person for whom you got the place here, and this house is the one where\n",
      "you had me placed. What! You don’t recognize me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Jean Valjean; “and how happens it that you know me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You saved my life,” said the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned. A ray of moonlight outlined his profile, and Jean Valjean\n",
      "recognized old Fauchelevent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” said Jean Valjean, “so it is you? Yes, I recollect you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is very lucky,” said the old man, in a reproachful tone.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Why, I am covering my melons, of course!”\n",

      "\n",
      "In fact, at the moment when Jean Valjean accosted him, old Fauchelevent\n",
      "held in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in\n",
      "spreading over the melon bed. During the hour or thereabouts that he\n",
      "had been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them. It\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean, finding himself known to this man, at least only under\n",
      "the name of Madeleine, thenceforth advanced only with caution. He\n",

      "“And what is this bell which you wear on your knee?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "When Jean Valjean, on the evening of the very day when Javert had\n",
      "arrested him beside Fantine’s death-bed, had escaped from the town jail\n",
      "of M. sur M., the police had supposed that he had betaken himself to\n",
      "Paris. Paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost, and everything\n",
      "disappears in this belly of the world, as in the belly of the sea. No\n",
      "forest hides a man as does that crowd. Fugitives of every sort know\n",
      "this. They go to Paris as to an abyss; there are gulfs which save. The\n",
      "police know it also, and it is in Paris that they seek what they have\n",
      "lost elsewhere. They sought the ex-mayor of M. sur M. Javert was\n",
      "summoned to Paris to throw light on their researches. Javert had, in\n",
      "fact, rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of Jean Valjean.\n",
      "Javert’s zeal and intelligence on that occasion had been remarked by M.\n",
      "Chabouillet, secretary of the Prefecture under Comte Anglès. M.\n",
      "Chabouillet, who had, moreover, already been Javert’s patron, had the\n",
      "inspector of M. sur M. attached to the police force of Paris. There\n",
      "Javert rendered himself useful in divers and, though the word may seem\n",
      "strange for such services, honorable manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "He no longer thought of Jean Valjean,—the wolf of to-day causes these\n",
      "dogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday,—when,\n",
      "in December, 1823, he read a newspaper, he who never read newspapers;\n",
      "but Javert, a monarchical man, had a desire to know the particulars of\n",
      "the triumphal entry of the “Prince Generalissimo” into Bayonne. Just as\n",
      "he was finishing the article, which interested him; a name, the name of\n",
      "Jean Valjean, attracted his attention at the bottom of a page. The\n",
      "paper announced that the convict Jean Valjean was dead, and published\n",
      "the fact in such formal terms that Javert did not doubt it. He confined\n",
      "himself to the remark, “That’s a good entry.” Then he threw aside the\n",
      "paper, and thought no more about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some time afterwards, it chanced that a police report was transmitted\n",
      "from the prefecture of the Seine-et-Oise to the prefecture of police in\n",
      "Paris, concerning the abduction of a child, which had taken place,\n",
      "under peculiar circumstances, as it was said, in the commune of\n",
      "Montfermeil. A little girl of seven or eight years of age, the report\n",
      "said, who had been intrusted by her mother to an inn-keeper of that\n",
      "neighborhood, had been stolen by a stranger; this child answered to the\n",
      "name of Cosette, and was the daughter of a girl named Fantine, who had\n",
      "died in the hospital, it was not known where or when.\n",
      "\n",
      "This report came under Javert’s eye and set him to thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The name of Fantine was well known to him. He remembered that Jean\n",
      "Valjean had made him, Javert, burst into laughter, by asking him for a\n",
      "respite of three days, for the purpose of going to fetch that\n",
      "creature’s child. He recalled the fact that Jean Valjean had been\n",
      "arrested in Paris at the very moment when he was stepping into the\n",
      "coach for Montfermeil. Some signs had made him suspect at the time that\n",
      "this was the second occasion of his entering that coach, and that he\n",
      "had already, on the previous day, made an excursion to the neighborhood\n",
      "of that village, for he had not been seen in the village itself. What\n",
      "had he been intending to do in that region of Montfermeil? It could not\n",
      "even be surmised. Javert understood it now. Fantine’s daughter was\n",
      "there. Jean Valjean was going there in search of her. And now this\n",
      "child had been stolen by a stranger! Who could that stranger be? Could\n",
      "it be Jean Valjean? But Jean Valjean was dead. Javert, without saying\n",
      "anything to anybody, took the coach from the _Pewter Platter_,\n",
      "Cul-de-Sac de la Planchette, and made a trip to Montfermeil.\n",
      "\n",
      "He expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there; he\n",
      "found a great deal of obscurity.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first few days the Thénardiers had chattered in their rage. The\n",
      "disappearance of the Lark had created a sensation in the village. He\n",
      "immediately obtained numerous versions of the story, which ended in the\n",
      "abduction of a child. Hence the police report. But their first vexation\n",
      "having passed off, Thénardier, with his wonderful instinct, had very\n",
      "quickly comprehended that it is never advisable to stir up the\n",
      "prosecutor of the Crown, and that his complaints with regard to the\n",
      "_abduction_ of Cosette would have as their first result to fix upon\n",
      "himself, and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand, the\n",
      "glittering eye of justice. The last thing that owls desire is to have a\n",
      "candle brought to them. And in the first place, how explain the fifteen\n",
      "hundred francs which he had received? He turned squarely round, put a\n",
      "gag on his wife’s mouth, and feigned astonishment when the _stolen\n",
      "child_ was mentioned to him. He understood nothing about it; no doubt\n",
      "he had grumbled for awhile at having that dear little creature “taken\n",
      "from him” so hastily; he should have liked to keep her two or three\n",
      "days longer, out of tenderness; but her “grandfather” had come for her\n",
      "in the most natural way in the world. He added the “grandfather,” which\n",
      "produced a good effect. This was the story that Javert hit upon when he\n",
      "arrived at Montfermeil. The grandfather caused Jean Valjean to vanish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, Javert dropped a few questions, like plummets, into\n",
      "Thénardier’s history. “Who was that grandfather? and what was his\n",
      "name?” Thénardier replied with simplicity: “He is a wealthy farmer. I\n",
      "saw his passport. I think his name was M. Guillaume Lambert.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name. Thereupon\n",
      "Javert returned to Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jean Valjean is certainly dead,” said he, “and I am a ninny.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He had again begun to forget this history, when, in the course of\n",
      "March, 1824, he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish\n",
      "of Saint-Médard and who had been surnamed “the mendicant who gives\n",
      "alms.” This person, the story ran, was a man of means, whose name no\n",
      "one knew exactly, and who lived alone with a little girl of eight\n",
      "years, who knew nothing about herself, save that she had come from\n",
      "Montfermeil. Montfermeil! that name was always coming up, and it made\n",
      "Javert prick up his ears. An old beggar police spy, an ex-beadle, to\n",
      "whom this person had given alms, added a few more details. This\n",
      "gentleman of property was very shy,—never coming out except in the\n",
      "evening, speaking to no one, except, occasionally to the poor, and\n",
      "never allowing any one to approach him. He wore a horrible old yellow\n",
      "frock-coat, which was worth many millions, being all wadded with\n",
      "bank-bills. This piqued Javert’s curiosity in a decided manner. In\n",
      "order to get a close look at this fantastic gentleman without alarming\n",
      "him, he borrowed the beadle’s outfit for a day, and the place where the\n",
      "old spy was in the habit of crouching every evening, whining orisons\n",
      "through his nose, and playing the spy under cover of prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The suspected individual” did indeed approach Javert thus disguised,\n",
      "and bestow alms on him. At that moment Javert raised his head, and the\n",
      "shock which Jean Valjean received on recognizing Javert was equal to\n",
      "the one received by Javert when he thought he recognized Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the darkness might have misled him; Jean Valjean’s death was\n",
      "official; Javert cherished very grave doubts; and when in doubt,\n",
      "Javert, the man of scruples, never laid a finger on any one’s collar.\n",
      "\n",
      "He followed his man to the Gorbeau house, and got “the old woman” to\n",
      "talking, which was no difficult matter. The old woman confirmed the\n",
      "fact regarding the coat lined with millions, and narrated to him the\n",
      "episode of the thousand-franc bill. She had seen it! She had handled\n",
      "it! Javert hired a room; that evening he installed himself in it. He\n",
      "came and listened at the mysterious lodger’s door, hoping to catch the\n",
      "sound of his voice, but Jean Valjean saw his candle through the\n",
      "key-hole, and foiled the spy by keeping silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the following day Jean Valjean decamped; but the noise made by the\n",
      "fall of the five-franc piece was noticed by the old woman, who, hearing\n",
      "the rattling of coin, suspected that he might be intending to leave,\n",
      "and made haste to warn Javert. At night, when Jean Valjean came out,\n",
      "Javert was waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two\n",
      "men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert had demanded assistance at the Prefecture, but he had not\n",
      "mentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize; that was\n",
      "his secret, and he had kept it for three reasons: in the first place,\n",
      "because the slightest indiscretion might put Jean Valjean on the alert;\n",
      "next, because, to lay hands on an ex-convict who had made his escape\n",
      "and was reputed dead, on a criminal whom justice had formerly classed\n",
      "forever as _among malefactors of the most dangerous sort_, was a\n",
      "magnificent success which the old members of the Parisian police would\n",
      "assuredly not leave to a newcomer like Javert, and he was afraid of\n",
      "being deprived of his convict; and lastly, because Javert, being an\n",
      "artist, had a taste for the unforeseen. He hated those well-heralded\n",
      "successes which are talked of long in advance and have had the bloom\n",
      "brushed off. He preferred to elaborate his masterpieces in the dark and\n",
      "to unveil them suddenly at the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert had followed Jean Valjean from tree to tree, then from corner to\n",
      "corner of the street, and had not lost sight of him for a single\n",
      "instant; even at the moments when Jean Valjean believed himself to be\n",
      "the most secure Javert’s eye had been on him. Why had not Javert\n",
      "arrested Jean Valjean? Because he was still in doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "It must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely\n",
      "at its ease; the free press embarrassed it; several arbitrary arrests\n",
      "denounced by the newspapers, had echoed even as far as the Chambers,\n",
      "and had rendered the Prefecture timid. Interference with individual\n",
      "liberty was a grave matter. The police agents were afraid of making a\n",
      "mistake; the prefect laid the blame on them; a mistake meant dismissal.\n",
      "The reader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph,\n",
      "reproduced by twenty newspapers, would have caused in Paris:\n",
      "“Yesterday, an aged grandfather, with white hair, a respectable and\n",
      "well-to-do gentleman, who was walking with his grandchild, aged eight,\n",
      "was arrested and conducted to the agency of the Prefecture as an\n",
      "escaped convict!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us repeat in addition that Javert had scruples of his own;\n",
      "injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of the\n",
      "prefect. He was really in doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadness, uneasiness, anxiety, depression, this fresh misfortune of\n",
      "being forced to flee by night, to seek a chance refuge in Paris for\n",
      "Cosette and himself, the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace\n",
      "of the child—all this, without his being aware of it, had altered Jean\n",
      "Valjean’s walk, and impressed on his bearing such senility, that the\n",
      "police themselves, incarnate in the person of Javert, might, and did in\n",
      "fact, make a mistake. The impossibility of approaching too close, his\n",
      "costume of an _émigré_ preceptor, the declaration of Thénardier which\n",
      "made a grandfather of him, and, finally, the belief in his death in\n",
      "prison, added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in\n",
      "Javert’s mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "For an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his\n",
      "papers; but if the man was not Jean Valjean, and if this man was not a\n",
      "good, honest old fellow living on his income, he was probably some\n",
      "merry blade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of\n",
      "Parisian misdeeds, some chief of a dangerous band, who gave alms to\n",
      "conceal his other talents, which was an old dodge. He had trusty\n",
      "fellows, accomplices’ retreats in case of emergencies, in which he\n",
      "would, no doubt, take refuge. All these turns which he was making\n",
      "through the streets seemed to indicate that he was not a simple and\n",
      "honest man. To arrest him too hastily would be “to kill the hen that\n",
      "laid the golden eggs.” Where was the inconvenience in waiting? Javert\n",
      "was very sure that he would not escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind, putting to\n",
      "himself a hundred questions about this enigmatical personage.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only quite late in the Rue de Pontoise, that, thanks to the\n",
      "brilliant light thrown from a dram-shop, he decidedly recognized Jean\n",
      "Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are in this world two beings who give a profound start,—the\n",
      "mother who recovers her child and the tiger who recovers his prey.\n",
      "Javert gave that profound start.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he had positively recognized Jean Valjean, the formidable\n",
      "convict, he perceived that there were only three of them, and he asked\n",
      "for reinforcements at the police station of the Rue de Pontoise. One\n",
      "puts on gloves before grasping a thorn cudgel.\n",
      "\n",
      "This delay and the halt at the Carrefour Rollin to consult with his\n",
      "agents came near causing him to lose the trail. He speedily divined,\n",
      "however, that Jean Valjean would want to put the river between his\n",
      "pursuers and himself. He bent his head and reflected like a blood-hound\n",
      "who puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right\n",
      "scent. Javert, with his powerful rectitude of instinct, went straight\n",
      "to the bridge of Austerlitz. A word with the toll-keeper furnished him\n",
      "with the information which he required: “Have you seen a man with a\n",
      "little girl?” “I made him pay two sous,” replied the toll-keeper.\n",
      "Javert reached the bridge in season to see Jean Valjean traverse the\n",
      "small illuminated spot on the other side of the water, leading Cosette\n",
      "by the hand. He saw him enter the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine; he\n",
      "remembered the Cul-de-Sac Genrot arranged there like a trap, and of the\n",
      "sole exit of the Rue Droit-Mur into the Rue Petit-Picpus. _He made sure\n",
      "of his back burrows_, as huntsmen say; he hastily despatched one of his\n",
      "agents, by a roundabout way, to guard that issue. A patrol which was\n",
      "returning to the Arsenal post having passed him, he made a requisition\n",
      "on it, and caused it to accompany him. In such games soldiers are aces.\n",
      "Moreover, the principle is, that in order to get the best of a wild\n",
      "boar, one must employ the science of venery and plenty of dogs. These\n",

      "Nothing, half a century ago, more resembled every other carriage gate\n",
      "than the carriage gate of Number 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. This entrance,\n",
      "which usually stood ajar in the most inviting fashion, permitted a view\n",
      "of two things, neither of which have anything very funereal about\n",
      "them,—a courtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines, and the face of\n",
      "a lounging porter. Above the wall, at the bottom of the court, tall\n",
      "trees were visible. When a ray of sunlight enlivened the courtyard,\n",
      "when a glass of wine cheered up the porter, it was difficult to pass\n",
      "Number 62 Little Picpus Street without carrying away a smiling\n",
      "impression of it. Nevertheless, it was a sombre place of which one had\n",
      "had a glimpse.\n",
      "\n",
      "The threshold smiled; the house prayed and wept.\n",
      "\n",
      "If one succeeded in passing the porter, which was not easy,—which was\n",
      "even nearly impossible for every one, for there was an _open sesame!_\n",
      "which it was necessary to know,—if, the porter once passed, one entered\n",
      "a little vestibule on the right, on which opened a staircase shut in\n",
      "between two walls and so narrow that only one person could ascend it at\n",
      "a time, if one did not allow one’s self to be alarmed by a daubing of\n",
      "canary yellow, with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase,\n",
      "if one ventured to ascend it, one crossed a first landing, then a\n",
      "second, and arrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow\n",
      "wash and the chocolate-hued plinth pursued one with a peaceable\n",
      "persistency. Staircase and corridor were lighted by two beautiful\n",
      "windows. The corridor took a turn and became dark. If one doubled this\n",
      "cape, one arrived a few paces further on, in front of a door which was\n",
      "all the more mysterious because it was not fastened. If one opened it,\n",
      "one found one’s self in a little chamber about six feet square, tiled,\n",
      "well-scrubbed, clean, cold, and hung with nankin paper with green\n",
      "flowers, at fifteen sous the roll. A white, dull light fell from a\n",
      "large window, with tiny panes, on the left, which usurped the whole\n",
      "width of the room. One gazed about, but saw no one; one listened, one\n",
      "heard neither a footstep nor a human murmur. The walls were bare, the\n",
      "chamber was not furnished; there was not even a chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "One looked again, and beheld on the wall facing the door a quadrangular\n",
      "hole, about a foot square, with a grating of interlacing iron bars,\n",
      "black, knotted, solid, which formed squares—I had almost said meshes—of\n",
      "less than an inch and a half in diagonal length. The little green\n",
      "flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to those\n",
      "iron bars, without being startled or thrown into confusion by their\n",
      "funereal contact. Supposing that a living being had been so wonderfully\n",
      "thin as to essay an entrance or an exit through the square hole, this\n",
      "grating would have prevented it. It did not allow the passage of the\n",
      "body, but it did allow the passage of the eyes; that is to say, of the\n",
      "mind. This seems to have occurred to them, for it had been re-enforced\n",
      "by a sheet of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear, and\n",
      "pierced with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes of a\n",
      "strainer. At the bottom of this plate, an aperture had been pierced\n",
      "exactly similar to the orifice of a letter box. A bit of tape attached\n",
      "to a bell-wire hung at the right of the grated opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the tape was pulled, a bell rang, and one heard a voice very near at\n",
      "hand, which made one start.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is there?” the voice demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a woman’s voice, a gentle voice, so gentle that it was mournful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, again, there was a magical word which it was necessary to know.\n",
      "If one did not know it, the voice ceased, the wall became silent once\n",
      "more, as though the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had been on\n",
      "the other side of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If one knew the password, the voice resumed, “Enter on the right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One then perceived on the right, facing the window, a glass door\n",
      "surmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray. On raising the latch and\n",
      "crossing the threshold, one experienced precisely the same impression\n",
      "as when one enters at the theatre into a grated _baignoire_, before the\n",
      "grating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted. One was, in fact, in\n",
      "a sort of theatre-box, narrow, furnished with two old chairs, and a\n",
      "much-frayed straw matting, sparely illuminated by the vague light from\n",
      "the glass door; a regular box, with its front just of a height to lean\n",
      "upon, bearing a tablet of black wood. This box was grated, only the\n",
      "grating of it was not of gilded wood, as at the opera; it was a\n",
      "monstrous lattice of iron bars, hideously interlaced and riveted to the\n",
      "wall by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first minutes passed; when one’s eyes began to grow used to this\n",
      "cellar-like half-twilight, one tried to pass the grating, but got no\n",
      "further than six inches beyond it. There he encountered a barrier of\n",
      "black shutters, re-enforced and fortified with transverse beams of wood\n",
      "painted a gingerbread yellow. These shutters were divided into long,\n",
      "narrow slats, and they masked the entire length of the grating. They\n",
      "were always closed. At the expiration of a few moments one heard a\n",
      "voice proceeding from behind these shutters, and saying:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am here. What do you wish with me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a beloved, sometimes an adored, voice. No one was visible.\n",
      "Hardly the sound of a breath was audible. It seemed as though it were a\n",
      "spirit which had been evoked, that was speaking to you across the walls\n",
      "of the tomb.\n",
      "\n",
      "If one chanced to be within certain prescribed and very rare\n",
      "conditions, the slat of one of the shutters opened opposite you; the\n",
      "evoked spirit became an apparition. Behind the grating, behind the\n",
      "shutter, one perceived so far as the grating permitted sight, a head,\n",
      "of which only the mouth and the chin were visible; the rest was covered\n",
      "with a black veil. One caught a glimpse of a black guimpe, and a form\n",
      "that was barely defined, covered with a black shroud. That head spoke\n",
      "with you, but did not look at you and never smiled at you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner that\n",
      "you saw her in the white, and she saw you in the black. This light was\n",
      "symbolical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which was\n",
      "made in that place shut off from all glances. A profound vagueness\n",
      "enveloped that form clad in mourning. Your eyes searched that\n",
      "vagueness, and sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition.\n",
      "At the expiration of a very short time you discovered that you could\n",
      "see nothing. What you beheld was night, emptiness, shadows, a wintry\n",
      "mist mingled with a vapor from the tomb, a sort of terrible peace, a\n",
      "silence from which you could gather nothing, not even sighs, a gloom in\n",
      "which you could distinguish nothing, not even phantoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you beheld was the interior of a cloister.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was called\n",
      "the Convent of the Bernardines of the Perpetual Adoration. The box in\n",
      "which you stood was the parlor. The first voice which had addressed you\n",
      "was that of the portress who always sat motionless and silent, on the\n",
      "other side of the wall, near the square opening, screened by the iron\n",
      "grating and the plate with its thousand holes, as by a double visor.\n",
      "The obscurity which bathed the grated box arose from the fact that the\n",
      "parlor, which had a window on the side of the world, had none on the\n",
      "side of the convent. Profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, there was something beyond that shadow; there was a\n",
      "light; there was life in the midst of that death. Although this was the\n",
      "most strictly walled of all convents, we shall endeavor to make our way\n",
      "into it, and to take the reader in, and to say, without transgressing\n",
      "the proper bounds, things which story-tellers have never seen, and\n",
      "have, therefore, never described.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This convent, which in 1824 had already existed for many a long year in\n",
      "the Rue Petit-Picpus, was a community of Bernardines of the obedience\n",
      "of Martin Verga.\n",
      "\n",
      "These Bernardines were attached, in consequence, not to Clairvaux, like\n",
      "the Bernardine monks, but to Cîteaux, like the Benedictine monks. In\n",
      "other words, they were the subjects, not of Saint Bernard, but of Saint\n",
      "Benoît.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that Martin\n",
      "Verga founded in 1425 a congregation of Bernardines-Benedictines, with\n",
      "Salamanca for the head of the order, and Alcala as the branch\n",
      "establishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "This congregation had sent out branches throughout all the Catholic\n",
      "countries of Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing unusual in the Latin Church in these grafts of one\n",
      "order on another. To mention only a single order of Saint-Benoît, which\n",
      "is here in question: there are attached to this order, without counting\n",
      "the obedience of Martin Verga, four congregations,—two in Italy,\n",
      "Mont-Cassin and Sainte-Justine of Padua; two in France, Cluny and\n",
      "Saint-Maur; and nine orders,—Vallombrosa, Granmont, the Célestins, the\n",
      "Camaldules, the Carthusians, the Humiliés, the Olivateurs, the\n",
      "Silvestrins, and lastly, Cîteaux; for Cîteaux itself, a trunk for other\n",
      "orders, is only an offshoot of Saint-Benoît. Cîteaux dates from Saint\n",
      "Robert, Abbé de Molesme, in the diocese of Langres, in 1098. Now it was\n",
      "in 529 that the devil, having retired to the desert of Subiaco—he was\n",
      "old—had he turned hermit?—was chased from the ancient temple of Apollo,\n",
      "where he dwelt, by Saint-Benoît, then aged seventeen.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the rule of the Carmelites, who go barefoot, wear a bit of willow\n",
      "on their throats, and never sit down, the harshest rule is that of the\n",
      "Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga. They are clothed in black,\n",
      "with a guimpe, which, in accordance with the express command of\n",
      "Saint-Benoît, mounts to the chin. A robe of serge with large sleeves, a\n",
      "large woollen veil, the guimpe which mounts to the chin cut square on\n",
      "the breast, the band which descends over their brow to their eyes,—this\n",
      "is their dress. All is black except the band, which is white. The\n",
      "novices wear the same habit, but all in white. The professed nuns also\n",
      "wear a rosary at their side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga practise the Perpetual\n",
      "Adoration, like the Benedictines called Ladies of the Holy Sacrament,\n",
      "who, at the beginning of this century, had two houses in Paris,—one at\n",
      "the Temple, the other in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève. However, the\n",
      "Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus, of whom we are speaking,\n",
      "were a totally different order from the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament,\n",
      "cloistered in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève and at the Temple. There\n",
      "were numerous differences in their rule; there were some in their\n",
      "costume. The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus wore the\n",
      "black guimpe, and the Benedictines of the Holy Sacrament and of the Rue\n",
      "Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève wore a white one, and had, besides, on their\n",
      "breasts, a Holy Sacrament about three inches long, in silver gilt or\n",
      "gilded copper. The nuns of the Petit-Picpus did not wear this Holy\n",
      "Sacrament. The Perpetual Adoration, which was common to the house of\n",
      "the Petit-Picpus and to the house of the Temple, leaves those two\n",
      "orders perfectly distinct. Their only resemblance lies in this practice\n",
      "of the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament and the Bernardines of Martin\n",
      "Verga, just as there existed a similarity in the study and the\n",
      "glorification of all the mysteries relating to the infancy, the life,\n",
      "and death of Jesus Christ and the Virgin, between the two orders, which\n",
      "were, nevertheless, widely separated, and on occasion even hostile. The\n",
      "Oratory of Italy, established at Florence by Philip de Neri, and the\n",
      "Oratory of France, established by Pierre de Bérulle. The Oratory of\n",

      "abstain from meat, fast in Lent and on many other days which are\n",
      "peculiar to them, rise from their first sleep, from one to three\n",
      "o’clock in the morning, to read their breviary and chant matins, sleep\n",
      "in all seasons between serge sheets and on straw, make no use of the\n",

      "year, from September 14th, which is the Exaltation of the Holy Cross,\n",
      "until Easter. These six months are a modification: the rule says all\n",
      "the year, but this drugget chemise, intolerable in the heat of summer,\n",
      "produced fevers and nervous spasms. The use of it had to be restricted.\n",
      "Even with this palliation, when the nuns put on this chemise on the\n",
      "14th of September, they suffer from fever for three or four days.\n",
      "Obedience, poverty, chastity, perseverance in their seclusion,—these\n",

      "The prioress is elected for three years by the mothers, who are called\n",
      "_mères vocales_ because they have a voice in the chapter. A prioress\n",

      "plain, and the food of the children themselves severe. A single dish of\n",
      "meat and vegetables combined, or salt fish—such was their luxury. This\n",
      "meagre fare, which was reserved for the pupils alone, was,\n",
      "nevertheless, an exception. The children ate in silence, under the eye\n",
      "of the mother whose turn it was, who, if a fly took a notion to fly or\n",
      "to hum against the rule, opened and shut a wooden book from time to\n",

      "bowls in which the pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and\n",

      "There was in the convent a book which has never been printed except as\n",

      "precipitately.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "They played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabby\n",
      "fruit-trees. In spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of\n",

      "sometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or\n",
      "an inhabited pear on the sly. I will now cede the privilege of speech\n",
      "to a letter which lies before me, a letter written five and twenty\n",
      "years ago by an old pupil, now Madame la Duchesse de ——, one of the\n",
      "most elegant women in Paris. I quote literally: “One hides one’s pear\n",
      "or one’s apple as best one may. When one goes upstairs to put the veil\n",

      "for a day’s leave of absence—an enormity in so austere a community. The\n",
      "wager was accepted, but not one of those who bet believed that she\n",
      "would do it. When the moment came, as the archbishop was passing in\n",
      "front of the pupils, Mademoiselle Bouchard, to the indescribable terror\n",
      "of her companions, stepped out of the ranks, and said, “Monseigneur, a\n",
      "day’s leave of absence.” Mademoiselle Bouchard was tall, blooming, with\n",
      "the prettiest little rosy face in the world. M. de Quélen smiled and\n",
      "said, “What, my dear child, a day’s leave of absence! Three days if you\n",
      "like. I grant you three days.” The prioress could do nothing; the\n",
      "archbishop had spoken. Horror of the convent, but joy of the pupil. The\n",
      "effect may be imagined.\n",
      "\n",
      "This stern cloister was not so well walled off, however, but that the\n",
      "life of the passions of the outside world, drama, and even romance, did\n",
      "not make their way in. To prove this, we will confine ourselves to\n",
      "recording here and to briefly mentioning a real and incontestable fact,\n",
      "which, however, bears no reference in itself to, and is not connected\n",
      "by any thread whatever with the story which we are relating. We mention\n",
      "the fact for the sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in\n",
      "the reader’s mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "About this time there was in the convent a mysterious person who was\n",
      "not a nun, who was treated with great respect, and who was addressed as\n",
      "_Madame Albertine_. Nothing was known about her, save that she was mad,\n",
      "and that in the world she passed for dead. Beneath this history it was\n",
      "said there lay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a great\n",
      "marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "This woman, hardly thirty years of age, of dark complexion and\n",
      "tolerably pretty, had a vague look in her large black eyes. Could she\n",
      "see? There was some doubt about this. She glided rather than walked,\n",
      "she never spoke; it was not quite known whether she breathed. Her\n",
      "nostrils were livid and pinched as after yielding up their last sigh.\n",
      "To touch her hand was like touching snow. She possessed a strange\n",
      "spectral grace. Wherever she entered, people felt cold. One day a\n",
      "sister, on seeing her pass, said to another sister, “She passes for a\n",
      "dead woman.” “Perhaps she is one,” replied the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "A hundred tales were told of Madame Albertine. This arose from the\n",
      "eternal curiosity of the pupils. In the chapel there was a gallery\n",
      "called _L’Œil de Bœuf_. It was in this gallery, which had only a\n",
      "circular bay, an _œil de bœuf_, that Madame Albertine listened to the\n",
      "offices. She always occupied it alone because this gallery, being on\n",
      "the level of the first story, the preacher or the officiating priest\n",
      "could be seen, which was interdicted to the nuns. One day the pulpit\n",
      "was occupied by a young priest of high rank, M. Le Duc de Rohan, peer\n",
      "of France, officer of the Red Musketeers in 1815 when he was Prince de\n",
      "Léon, and who died afterward, in 1830, as cardinal and Archbishop of\n",
      "Besançon. It was the first time that M. de Rohan had preached at the\n",
      "Petit-Picpus convent. Madame Albertine usually preserved perfect\n",
      "calmness and complete immobility during the sermons and services. That\n",
      "day, as soon as she caught sight of M. de Rohan, she half rose, and\n",
      "said, in a loud voice, amid the silence of the chapel, “Ah! Auguste!”\n",
      "The whole community turned their heads in amazement, the preacher\n",
      "raised his eyes, but Madame Albertine had relapsed into her immobility.\n",
      "A breath from the outer world, a flash of life, had passed for an\n",
      "instant across that cold and lifeless face and had then vanished, and\n",
      "the mad woman had become a corpse again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those two words, however, had set every one in the convent who had the\n",
      "privilege of speech to chattering. How many things were contained in\n",
      "that “Ah! Auguste!” what revelations! M. de Rohan’s name really was\n",
      "Auguste. It was evident that Madame Albertine belonged to the very\n",
      "highest society, since she knew M. de Rohan, and that her own rank\n",
      "there was of the highest, since she spoke thus familiarly of so great a\n",
      "lord, and that there existed between them some connection, of\n",
      "relationship, perhaps, but a very close one in any case, since she knew\n",
      "his “pet name.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Two very severe duchesses, Mesdames de Choiseul and de Sérent, often\n",
      "visited the community, whither they penetrated, no doubt, in virtue of\n",
      "the privilege _Magnates mulieres_, and caused great consternation in\n",
      "the boarding-school. When these two old ladies passed by, all the poor\n",
      "young girls trembled and dropped their eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, M. de Rohan, quite unknown to himself, was an object of\n",
      "attention to the school-girls. At that epoch he had just been made,\n",
      "while waiting for the episcopate, vicar-general of the Archbishop of\n",
      "Paris. It was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate\n",
      "the offices in the chapel of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus. Not one of\n",
      "the young recluses could see him, because of the serge curtain, but he\n",
      "had a sweet and rather shrill voice, which they had come to know and to\n",
      "distinguish. He had been a mousquetaire, and then, he was said to be\n",
      "very coquettish, that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed in\n",
      "a roll around his head, and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent\n",
      "moire, and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the\n",
      "world. He held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen\n",
      "years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a sound from without made its way into the convent. But there was\n",
      "one year when the sound of a flute penetrated thither. This was an\n",
      "event, and the girls who were at school there at the time still recall\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a flute which was played in the neighborhood. This flute always\n",
      "played the same air, an air which is very far away nowadays,—“My\n",
      "Zétulbé, come reign o’er my soul,”—and it was heard two or three times\n",
      "a day. The young girls passed hours in listening to it, the vocal\n",
      "mothers were upset by it, brains were busy, punishments descended in\n",
      "showers. This lasted for several months. The girls were all more or\n",
      "less in love with the unknown musician. Each one dreamed that she was\n",
      "Zétulbé. The sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the Rue\n",
      "Droit-Mur; and they would have given anything, compromised everything,\n",
      "attempted anything for the sake of seeing, of catching a glance, if\n",
      "only for a second, of the “young man” who played that flute so\n",
      "deliciously, and who, no doubt, played on all these souls at the same\n",
      "time. There were some who made their escape by a back door, and\n",
      "ascended to the third story on the Rue Droit-Mur side, in order to\n",
      "attempt to catch a glimpse through the gaps. Impossible! One even went\n",
      "so far as to thrust her arm through the grating, and to wave her white\n",
      "handkerchief. Two were still bolder. They found means to climb on a\n",
      "roof, and risked their lives there, and succeeded at last in seeing\n",
      "“the young man.” He was an old _émigré_ gentleman, blind and penniless,\n",

      "distinct buildings,—the Great Convent, inhabited by the nuns, the\n",
      "Boarding-school, where the scholars were lodged; and lastly, what was\n",
      "called the Little Convent. It was a building with a garden, in which\n",
      "lived all sorts of aged nuns of various orders, the relics of cloisters\n",
      "destroyed in the Revolution; a reunion of all the black, gray, and\n",
      "white medleys of all communities and all possible varieties; what might\n",
      "be called, if such a coupling of words is permissible, a sort of\n",
      "harlequin convent.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Empire was established, all these poor old dispersed and\n",
      "exiled women had been accorded permission to come and take shelter\n",
      "under the wings of the Bernardines-Benedictines. The government paid\n",
      "them a small pension, the ladies of the Petit-Picpus received them\n",
      "cordially. It was a singular pell-mell. Each followed her own rule.\n",
      "Sometimes the pupils of the boarding-school were allowed, as a great\n",
      "recreation, to pay them a visit; the result is, that all those young\n",
      "memories have retained among other souvenirs that of Mother\n",
      "Sainte-Bazile, Mother Sainte-Scolastique, and Mother Jacob.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of these refugees found herself almost at home. She was a nun of\n",
      "Sainte-Aure, the only one of her order who had survived. The ancient\n",
      "convent of the ladies of Sainte-Aure occupied, at the beginning of the\n",
      "eighteenth century, this very house of the Petit-Picpus, which belonged\n",
      "later to the Benedictines of Martin Verga. This holy woman, too poor to\n",
      "wear the magnificent habit of her order, which was a white robe with a\n",
      "scarlet scapulary, had piously put it on a little manikin, which she\n",
      "exhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house at her\n",
      "death. In 1824, only one nun of this order remained; to-day, there\n",
      "remains only a doll.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to these worthy mothers, some old society women had\n",
      "obtained permission of the prioress, like Madame Albertine, to retire\n",
      "into the Little Convent. Among the number were Madame Beaufort\n",
      "d’Hautpoul and Marquise Dufresne. Another was never known in the\n",
      "convent except by the formidable noise which she made when she blew her\n",
      "nose. The pupils called her Madame Vacarmini (hubbub).\n",
      "\n",
      "About 1820 or 1821, Madame de Genlis, who was at that time editing a\n",
      "little periodical publication called _l’Intrépide_, asked to be allowed\n",
      "to enter the convent of the Petit-Picpus as lady resident. The Duc\n",
      "d’Orléans recommended her. Uproar in the hive; the vocal-mothers were\n",
      "all in a flutter; Madame de Genlis had made romances. But she declared\n",
      "that she was the first to detest them, and then, she had reached her\n",
      "fierce stage of devotion. With the aid of God, and of the Prince, she\n",
      "entered. She departed at the end of six or eight months, alleging as a\n",
      "reason, that there was no shade in the garden. The nuns were delighted.\n",
      "Although very old, she still played the harp, and did it very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she went away she left her mark in her cell. Madame de Genlis was\n",
      "superstitious and a Latinist. These two words furnish a tolerably good\n",
      "profile of her. A few years ago, there were still to be seen, pasted in\n",
      "the inside of a little cupboard in her cell in which she locked up her\n",
      "silverware and her jewels, these five lines in Latin, written with her\n",
      "own hand in red ink on yellow paper, and which, in her opinion,\n",

      "the pretensions put forward in the last century by the Vicomte de\n",
      "Gestas, of a descent from the wicked thief. However, the useful virtue\n",

      "world. Suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand, and\n",
      "folded in such a manner as to form, not, as in ordinary churches, a\n",
      "prolongation behind the altar, but a sort of hall, or obscure cellar,\n",

      "lane, called Rue Aumarais on old plans. These four streets surrounded\n",
      "this trapezium like a moat. The convent was composed of several\n",
      "buildings and a garden. The principal building, taken in its entirety,\n",
      "was a juxtaposition of hybrid constructions which, viewed from a\n",
      "bird’s-eye view, outlined, with considerable exactness, a gibbet laid\n",

      "was a low, arched door, whitened with dust and ashes, where the spiders\n",
      "wove their webs, and which was open only for an hour or two on Sundays,\n",
      "and on rare occasions, when the coffin of a nun left the convent. This\n",
      "was the public entrance of the church. The elbow of the gibbet was a\n",
      "square hall which was used as the servants’ hall, and which the nuns\n",
      "called _the buttery_. In the main arm were the cells of the mothers,\n",
      "the sisters, and the novices. In the lesser arm lay the kitchens, the\n",
      "refectory, backed up by the cloisters and the church. Between the door\n",
      "No. 62 and the corner of the closed Aumarais Lane, was the school,\n",
      "which was not visible from without. The remainder of the trapezium\n",
      "formed the garden, which was much lower than the level of the Rue\n",
      "Polonceau, which caused the walls to be very much higher on the inside\n",
      "than on the outside. The garden, which was slightly arched, had in its\n",
      "centre, on the summit of a hillock, a fine pointed and conical\n",
      "fir-tree, whence ran, as from the peaked boss of a shield, four grand\n",
      "alleys, and, ranged by twos in between the branchings of these, eight\n",
      "small ones, so that, if the enclosure had been circular, the\n",

      "on a wheel. As the alleys all ended in the very irregular walls of the\n",

      "In the Little Convent there was a centenarian who came from the Abbey\n",

      "talked a great deal of M. de Miromesnil, Keeper of the Seals under\n",
      "Louis XVI. and of a Presidentess Duplat, with whom she had been very\n",
      "intimate. It was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on\n",
      "every pretext. She told wonders of the Abbey of Fontevrault,—that it\n",
      "was like a city, and that there were streets in the monastery.\n",
      "\n",
      "She talked with a Picard accent which amused the pupils. Every year,\n",
      "she solemnly renewed her vows, and at the moment of taking the oath,\n",
      "she said to the priest, “Monseigneur Saint-François gave it to\n",
      "Monseigneur Saint-Julien, Monseigneur Saint-Julien gave it to\n",
      "Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius, Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius gave it to\n",
      "Monseigneur Saint-Procopius, etc., etc.; and thus I give it to you,\n",
      "father.” And the school-girls would begin to laugh, not in their\n",
      "sleeves, but under their veils; charming little stifled laughs which\n",
      "made the vocal mothers frown.\n",
      "\n",
      "On another occasion, the centenarian was telling stories. She said that\n",
      "_in her youth the Bernardine monks were every whit as good as the\n",
      "mousquetaires_. It was a century which spoke through her, but it was\n",
      "the eighteenth century. She told about the custom of the four wines,\n",
      "which existed before the Revolution in Champagne and Bourgogne. When a\n",
      "great personage, a marshal of France, a prince, a duke, and a peer,\n",
      "traversed a town in Burgundy or Champagne, the city fathers came out to\n",
      "harangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which\n",
      "they had poured four different sorts of wine. On the first goblet this\n",
      "inscription could be read, _monkey wine_; on the second, _lion wine_;\n",
      "on the third, _sheep wine_; on the fourth, _hog wine_. These four\n",
      "legends express the four stages descended by the drunkard; the first,\n",
      "intoxication, which enlivens; the second, that which irritates; the\n",
      "third, that which dulls; and the fourth, that which brutalizes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a cupboard, under lock and key, she kept a mysterious object of\n",
      "which she thought a great deal. The rule of Fontevrault did not forbid\n",
      "this. She would not show this object to anyone. She shut herself up,\n",
      "which her rule allowed her to do, and hid herself, every time that she\n",
      "desired to contemplate it. If she heard a footstep in the corridor, she\n",
      "closed the cupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged\n",
      "hands. As soon as it was mentioned to her, she became silent, she who\n",
      "was so fond of talking. The most curious were baffled by her silence\n",
      "and the most tenacious by her obstinacy. Thus it furnished a subject of\n",
      "comment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent. What\n",
      "could that treasure of the centenarian be, which was so precious and so\n",
      "secret? Some holy book, no doubt? Some unique chaplet? Some authentic\n",
      "relic? They lost themselves in conjectures. When the poor old woman\n",
      "died, they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting,\n",
      "perhaps, and opened it. They found the object beneath a triple linen\n",
      "cloth, like some consecrated paten. It was a Faenza platter\n",
      "representing little Loves flitting away pursued by apothecary lads\n",
      "armed with enormous syringes. The chase abounds in grimaces and in\n",

      "curious, and which had, possibly, the honor of furnishing Molière with\n",

      "Adoration is not very ancient and does not go back more than two\n",
      "hundred years. In 1649 the holy sacrament was profaned on two occasions\n",
      "a few days apart, in two churches in Paris, at Saint-Sulpice and at\n",
      "Saint-Jean en Grève, a rare and frightful sacrilege which set the whole\n",

      "Nuncio officiated. But this expiation did not satisfy two sainted\n",
      "women, Madame Courtin, Marquise de Boucs, and the Comtesse de\n",
      "Châteauvieux. This outrage committed on “the most holy sacrament of the\n",
      "altar,” though but temporary, would not depart from these holy souls,\n",
      "and it seemed to them that it could only be extenuated by a “Perpetual\n",
      "Adoration” in some female monastery. Both of them, one in 1652, the\n",

      "was in its decay; this forms a part of the general death of the order,\n",
      "which, after the eighteenth century, has been disappearing like all the\n",

      "nuns, none at all. Forty years ago, the nuns numbered nearly a hundred;\n",
      "fifteen years ago there were not more than twenty-eight of them. How\n",
      "many are there to-day? In 1847, the prioress was young, a sign that the\n",

      "the heavy rule of Saint-Benoît. The burden is implacable, and remains\n",
      "the same for the few as for the many. It weighs down, it crushes. Thus\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the Rue\n",
      "Polonceau. That hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middle of\n",
      "the night, was the nuns chanting matins; that hall, of which he had\n",
      "caught a glimpse in the gloom, was the chapel. That phantom which he\n",
      "had seen stretched on the ground was the sister who was making\n",
      "reparation; that bell, the sound of which had so strangely surprised\n",
      "him, was the gardener’s bell attached to the knee of Father\n",
      "Fauchelevent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette once put to bed, Jean Valjean and Fauchelevent had, as we have\n",
      "already seen, supped on a glass of wine and a bit of cheese before a\n",
      "good, crackling fire; then, the only bed in the hut being occupied by\n",
      "Cosette, each threw himself on a truss of straw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he shut his eyes, Jean Valjean said: “I must remain here\n",
      "henceforth.” This remark trotted through Fauchelevent’s head all night\n",
      "long.\n",
      "\n",
      "To tell the truth, neither of them slept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean, feeling that he was discovered and that Javert was on his\n",
      "scent, understood that he and Cosette were lost if they returned to\n",
      "Paris. Then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded\n",
      "him in this cloister. Jean Valjean had, henceforth, but one thought,—to\n",
      "remain there. Now, for an unfortunate man in his position, this convent\n",
      "was both the safest and the most dangerous of places; the most\n",
      "dangerous, because, as no men might enter there, if he were discovered,\n",
      "it was a flagrant offence, and Jean Valjean would find but one step\n",
      "intervening between the convent and prison; the safest, because, if he\n",
      "could manage to get himself accepted there and remain there, who would\n",
      "ever seek him in such a place? To dwell in an impossible place was\n",
      "safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "On his side, Fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains. He began by\n",
      "declaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter. How had\n",
      "M. Madeleine got there, when the walls were what they were? Cloister\n",
      "walls are not to be stepped over. How did he get there with a child?\n",
      "One cannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child in one’s arms. Who\n",
      "was that child? Where did they both come from? Since Fauchelevent had\n",
      "lived in the convent, he had heard nothing of M. sur M., and he knew\n",
      "nothing of what had taken place there. Father Madeleine had an air\n",
      "which discouraged questions; and besides, Fauchelevent said to himself:\n",
      "“One does not question a saint.” M. Madeleine had preserved all his\n",
      "prestige in Fauchelevent’s eyes. Only, from some words which Jean\n",
      "Valjean had let fall, the gardener thought he could draw the inference\n",
      "that M. Madeleine had probably become bankrupt through the hard times,\n",
      "and that he was pursued by his creditors; or that he had compromised\n",
      "himself in some political affair, and was in hiding; which last did not\n",
      "displease Fauchelevent, who, like many of our peasants of the North,\n",
      "had an old fund of Bonapartism about him. While in hiding, M. Madeleine\n",
      "had selected the convent as a refuge, and it was quite simple that he\n",
      "should wish to remain there. But the inexplicable point, to which\n",
      "Fauchelevent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain,\n",
      "was that M. Madeleine should be there, and that he should have that\n",
      "little girl with him. Fauchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke to\n",
      "them, and still did not believe it possible. The incomprehensible had\n",
      "just made its entrance into Fauchelevent’s hut. Fauchelevent groped\n",
      "about amid conjectures, and could see nothing clearly but this: “M.\n",
      "Madeleine saved my life.” This certainty alone was sufficient and\n",
      "decided his course. He said to himself: “It is my turn now.” He added\n",
      "in his conscience: “M. Madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was\n",
      "a question of thrusting himself under the cart for the purpose of\n",
      "dragging me out.” He made up his mind to save M. Madeleine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, he put many questions to himself and made himself divers\n",
      "replies: “After what he did for me, would I save him if he were a\n",
      "thief? Just the same. If he were an assassin, would I save him? Just\n",
      "the same. Since he is a saint, shall I save him? Just the same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent!\n",
      "Fauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical\n",
      "undertaking; this poor peasant of Picardy without any other ladder than\n",
      "his self-devotion, his good will, and a little of that old rustic\n",
      "cunning, on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous\n",
      "enterprise, undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister, and\n",
      "the steep escarpments of the rule of Saint-Benoît. Father Fauchelevent\n",
      "was an old man who had been an egoist all his life, and who, towards\n",
      "the end of his days, halt, infirm, with no interest left to him in the\n",
      "world, found it sweet to be grateful, and perceiving a generous action\n",
      "to be performed, flung himself upon it like a man, who at the moment\n",
      "when he is dying, should find close to his hand a glass of good wine\n",
      "which he had never tasted, and should swallow it with avidity. We may\n",
      "add, that the air which he had breathed for many years in this convent\n",
      "had destroyed all personality in him, and had ended by rendering a good\n",
      "action of some kind absolutely necessary to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he took his resolve: to devote himself to M. Madeleine.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have just called him a _poor peasant of Picardy_. That description\n",
      "is just, but incomplete. At the point of this story which we have now\n",
      "reached, a little of Father Fauchelevent’s physiology becomes useful.\n",
      "He was a peasant, but he had been a notary, which added trickery to his\n",
      "cunning, and penetration to his ingenuousness. Having, through various\n",
      "causes, failed in his business, he had descended to the calling of a\n",
      "carter and a laborer. But, in spite of oaths and lashings, which horses\n",
      "seem to require, something of the notary had lingered in him. He had\n",
      "some natural wit; he talked good grammar; he conversed, which is a rare\n",
      "thing in a village; and the other peasants said of him: “He talks\n",
      "almost like a gentleman with a hat.” Fauchelevent belonged, in fact, to\n",
      "that species, which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last\n",
      "century qualified as _demi-bourgeois, demi-lout_, and which the\n",
      "metaphors showered by the château upon the thatched cottage ticketed in\n",
      "the pigeon-hole of the plebeian: _rather rustic, rather citified;\n",
      "pepper and salt_. Fauchelevent, though sorely tried and harshly used by\n",
      "fate, worn out, a sort of poor, threadbare old soul, was, nevertheless,\n",
      "an impulsive man, and extremely spontaneous in his actions; a precious\n",
      "quality which prevents one from ever being wicked. His defects and his\n",
      "vices, for he had some, were all superficial; in short, his physiognomy\n",
      "was of the kind which succeeds with an observer. His aged face had none\n",
      "of those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead, which\n",
      "signify malice or stupidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "At daybreak, Father Fauchelevent opened his eyes, after having done an\n",
      "enormous deal of thinking, and beheld M. Madeleine seated on his truss\n",
      "of straw, and watching Cosette’s slumbers. Fauchelevent sat up and\n",
      "said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now that you are here, how are you going to contrive to enter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This remark summed up the situation and aroused Jean Valjean from his\n",
      "reverie.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two men took counsel together.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the first place,” said Fauchelevent, “you will begin by not setting\n",
      "foot outside of this chamber, either you or the child. One step in the\n",
      "garden and we are done for.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur Madeleine,” resumed Fauchelevent, “you have arrived at a very\n",
      "auspicious moment, I mean to say a very inauspicious moment; one of the\n",
      "ladies is very ill. This will prevent them from looking much in our\n",
      "direction. It seems that she is dying. The prayers of the forty hours\n",
      "are being said. The whole community is in confusion. That occupies\n",
      "them. The one who is on the point of departure is a saint. In fact, we\n",
      "are all saints here; all the difference between them and me is that\n",
      "they say ‘our cell,’ and that I say ‘my cabin.’ The prayers for the\n",
      "dying are to be said, and then the prayers for the dead. We shall be at\n",
      "peace here for to-day; but I will not answer for to-morrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Still,” observed Jean Valjean, “this cottage is in the niche of the\n",
      "wall, it is hidden by a sort of ruin, there are trees, it is not\n",
      "visible from the convent.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“And I add that the nuns never come near it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?” said Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interrogation mark which accentuated this “well” signified: “it\n",
      "seems to me that one may remain concealed here?” It was to this\n",
      "interrogation point that Fauchelevent responded:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are the little girls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What little girls?” asked Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as Fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had\n",
      "uttered, a bell emitted one stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The nun is dead,” said he. “There is the knell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he made a sign to Jean Valjean to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bell struck a second time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is the knell, Monsieur Madeleine. The bell will continue to strike\n",
      "once a minute for twenty-four hours, until the body is taken from the\n",
      "church.—You see, they play. At recreation hours it suffices to have a\n",
      "ball roll aside, to send them all hither, in spite of prohibitions, to\n",
      "hunt and rummage for it all about here. Those cherubs are devils.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who?” asked Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The little girls. You would be very quickly discovered. They would\n",
      "shriek: ‘Oh! a man!’ There is no danger to-day. There will be no\n",
      "recreation hour. The day will be entirely devoted to prayers. You hear\n",
      "the bell. As I told you, a stroke each minute. It is the death knell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I understand, Father Fauchelevent. There are pupils.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And Jean Valjean thought to himself:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here is Cosette’s education already provided.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fauchelevent exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardine! There are little girls indeed! And they would bawl around\n",
      "you! And they would rush off! To be a man here is to have the plague.\n",
      "You see how they fasten a bell to my paw as though I were a wild\n",
      "beast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean fell into more and more profound thought.—“This convent\n",
      "would be our salvation,” he murmured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he raised his voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, the difficulty is to remain here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Fauchelevent, “the difficulty is to get out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To get out!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Monsieur Madeleine. In order to return here it is first necessary\n",
      "to get out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded,\n",
      "Fauchelevent went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must not be found here in this fashion. Whence come you? For me,\n",
      "you fall from heaven, because I know you; but the nuns require one to\n",
      "enter by the door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” said Fauchelevent, “they are ringing up the vocal mothers. They\n",
      "are going to the chapter. They always hold a chapter when any one dies.\n",
      "She died at daybreak. People generally do die at daybreak. But cannot\n",
      "you get out by the way in which you entered? Come, I do not ask for the\n",
      "sake of questioning you, but how did you get in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean turned pale; the very thought of descending again into\n",
      "that terrible street made him shudder. You make your way out of a\n",
      "forest filled with tigers, and once out of it, imagine a friendly\n",
      "counsel that shall advise you to return thither! Jean Valjean pictured\n",
      "to himself the whole police force still engaged in swarming in that\n",
      "quarter, agents on the watch, sentinels everywhere, frightful fists\n",
      "extended towards his collar, Javert at the corner of the intersection\n",
      "of the streets perhaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Impossible!” said he. “Father Fauchelevent, say that I fell from the\n",
      "sky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I believe it, I believe it,” retorted Fauchelevent. “You have no\n",
      "need to tell me that. The good God must have taken you in his hand for\n",
      "the purpose of getting a good look at you close to, and then dropped\n",
      "you. Only, he meant to place you in a man’s convent; he made a mistake.\n",
      "Come, there goes another peal, that is to order the porter to go and\n",
      "inform the municipality that the dead-doctor is to come here and view a\n",
      "corpse. All that is the ceremony of dying. These good ladies are not at\n",
      "all fond of that visit. A doctor is a man who does not believe in\n",
      "anything. He lifts the veil. Sometimes he lifts something else too. How\n",
      "quickly they have had the doctor summoned this time! What is the\n",
      "matter? Your little one is still asleep. What is her name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cosette.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is your daughter? You are her grandfather, that is?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will be easy enough for her to get out of here. I have my service\n",
      "door which opens on the courtyard. I knock. The porter opens; I have my\n",
      "vintage basket on my back, the child is in it, I go out. Father\n",
      "Fauchelevent goes out with his basket—that is perfectly natural. You\n",
      "will tell the child to keep very quiet. She will be under the cover. I\n",
      "will leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friend, a\n",
      "fruit-seller whom I know in the Rue Chemin-Vert, who is deaf, and who\n",
      "has a little bed. I will shout in the fruit-seller’s ear, that she is a\n",
      "niece of mine, and that she is to keep her for me until to-morrow. Then\n",
      "the little one will re-enter with you; for I will contrive to have you\n",
      "re-enter. It must be done. But how will you manage to get out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one must see me, the whole point lies there, Father Fauchelevent.\n",
      "Find some means of getting me out in a basket, under cover, like\n",
      "Cosette.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of\n",
      "his left hand, a sign of serious embarrassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "A third peal created a diversion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the dead-doctor taking his departure,” said Fauchelevent. “He\n",
      "has taken a look and said: ‘She is dead, that is well.’ When the doctor\n",
      "has signed the passport for paradise, the undertaker’s company sends a\n",
      "coffin. If it is a mother, the mothers lay her out; if she is a sister,\n",
      "the sisters lay her out. After which, I nail her up. That forms a part\n",
      "of my gardener’s duty. A gardener is a bit of a grave-digger. She is\n",
      "placed in a lower hall of the church which communicates with the\n",
      "street, and into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead. I\n",
      "don’t count the undertaker’s men and myself as men. It is in that hall\n",
      "that I nail up the coffin. The undertaker’s men come and get it, and\n",
      "whip up, coachman! that’s the way one goes to heaven. They fetch a box\n",
      "with nothing in it, they take it away again with something in it.\n",
      "That’s what a burial is like. _De profundis_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping\n",
      "Cosette, who lay with her mouth vaguely open, and had the air of an\n",
      "angel drinking in the light. Jean Valjean had fallen to gazing at her.\n",
      "He was no longer listening to Fauchelevent.\n",
      "\n",
      "That one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence. The\n",
      "good old gardener went on tranquilly with his babble:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The grave is dug in the Vaugirard cemetery. They declare that they are\n",
      "going to suppress that Vaugirard cemetery. It is an ancient cemetery\n",
      "which is outside the regulations, which has no uniform, and which is\n",
      "going to retire. It is a shame, for it is convenient. I have a friend\n",
      "there, Father Mestienne, the grave-digger. The nuns here possess one\n",
      "privilege, it is to be taken to that cemetery at nightfall. There is a\n",
      "special permission from the Prefecture on their behalf. But how many\n",
      "events have happened since yesterday! Mother Crucifixion is dead, and\n",
      "Father Madeleine—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is buried,” said Jean Valjean, smiling sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fauchelevent caught the word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Goodness! if you were here for good, it would be a real burial.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A fourth peal burst out. Fauchelevent hastily detached the belled\n",
      "knee-cap from its nail and buckled it on his knee again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This time it is for me. The Mother Prioress wants me. Good, now I am\n",
      "pricking myself on the tongue of my buckle. Monsieur Madeleine, don’t\n",
      "stir from here, and wait for me. Something new has come up. If you are\n",
      "hungry, there is wine, bread and cheese.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he hastened out of the hut, crying: “Coming! coming!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his\n",
      "crooked leg would permit, casting a sidelong glance by the way on his\n",
      "melon patch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Less than ten minutes later, Father Fauchelevent, whose bell put the\n",
      "nuns in his road to flight, tapped gently at a door, and a gentle voice\n",
      "replied: _“Forever! Forever!” _ that is to say: _“Enter.” _\n",
      "\n",
      "The door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the\n",
      "gardener on business. This parlor adjoined the chapter hall. The\n",

      "It is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions,\n",
      "notably priests and nuns, to wear a grave and agitated air on critical\n",
      "occasions. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, this double form of\n",
      "preoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress, who was\n",
      "that wise and charming Mademoiselle de Blemeur, Mother Innocente, who\n",
      "was ordinarily cheerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gardener made a timid bow, and remained at the door of the cell.\n",
      "The prioress, who was telling her beads, raised her eyes and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! it is you, Father Fauvent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This abbreviation had been adopted in the convent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fauchelevent bowed again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father Fauvent, I have sent for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here I am, reverend Mother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have something to say to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so have I,” said Fauchelevent with a boldness which caused him\n",
      "inward terror, “I have something to say to the very reverend Mother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The prioress stared at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! you have a communication to make to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“A request.”\n",

      "“Very well, speak.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Goodman Fauchelevent, the ex-notary, belonged to the category of\n",
      "peasants who have assurance. A certain clever ignorance constitutes a\n",
      "force; you do not distrust it, and you are caught by it. Fauchelevent\n",
      "had been a success during the something more than two years which he\n",
      "had passed in the convent. Always solitary and busied about his\n",
      "gardening, he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity. As\n",
      "he was at a distance from all those veiled women passing to and fro, he\n",
      "saw before him only an agitation of shadows. By dint of attention and\n",
      "sharpness he had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with flesh,\n",
      "and those corpses were alive for him. He was like a deaf man whose\n",
      "sight grows keener, and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more\n",
      "acute. He had applied himself to riddling out the significance of the\n",
      "different peals, and he had succeeded, so that this taciturn and\n",
      "enigmatical cloister possessed no secrets for him; the sphinx babbled\n",
      "all her secrets in his ear. Fauchelevent knew all and concealed all;\n",
      "that constituted his art. The whole convent thought him stupid. A great\n",
      "merit in religion. The vocal mothers made much of Fauchelevent. He was\n",
      "a curious mute. He inspired confidence. Moreover, he was regular, and\n",
      "never went out except for well-demonstrated requirements of the orchard\n",
      "and vegetable garden. This discretion of conduct had inured to his\n",
      "credit. Nonetheless, he had set two men to chattering: the porter, in\n",
      "the convent, and he knew the singularities of their parlor, and the\n",
      "grave-digger, at the cemetery, and he was acquainted with the\n",
      "peculiarities of their sepulture; in this way, he possessed a double\n",
      "light on the subject of these nuns, one as to their life, the other as\n",
      "to their death. But he did not abuse his knowledge. The congregation\n",
      "thought a great deal of him. Old, lame, blind to everything, probably a\n",
      "little deaf into the bargain,—what qualities! They would have found it\n",
      "difficult to replace him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goodman, with the assurance of a person who feels that he is\n",
      "appreciated, entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic\n",
      "harangue to the reverend prioress. He talked a long time about his age,\n",
      "his infirmities, the surcharge of years counting double for him\n",
      "henceforth, of the increasing demands of his work, of the great size of\n",
      "the garden, of nights which must be passed, like the last, for\n",
      "instance, when he had been obliged to put straw mats over the melon\n",
      "beds, because of the moon, and he wound up as follows: “That he had a\n",
      "brother”—(the prioress made a movement),—“a brother no longer young”—(a\n",
      "second movement on the part of the prioress, but one expressive of\n",
      "reassurance),—“that, if he might be permitted, this brother would come\n",
      "and live with him and help him, that he was an excellent gardener, that\n",
      "the community would receive from him good service, better than his own;\n",
      "that, otherwise, if his brother were not admitted, as he, the elder,\n",
      "felt that his health was broken and that he was insufficient for the\n",
      "work, he should be obliged, greatly to his regret, to go away; and that\n",
      "his brother had a little daughter whom he would bring with him, who\n",
      "might be reared for God in the house, and who might, who knows, become\n",
      "a nun some day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had finished speaking, the prioress stayed the slipping of her\n",
      "rosary between her fingers, and said to him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Could you procure a stout iron bar between now and this evening?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“For what purpose?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“To serve as a lever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, reverend Mother,” replied Fauchelevent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prioress, without adding a word, rose and entered the adjoining\n",
      "room, which was the hall of the chapter, and where the vocal mothers\n",

      "mother Alèthe. He began at Cîteaux, to end in Clairvaux; he was\n",
      "ordained abbot by the bishop of Châlon-sur-Saône, Guillaume de\n",
      "Champeaux; he had seven hundred novices, and founded a hundred and\n",
      "sixty monasteries; he overthrew Abeilard at the council of Sens in\n",
      "1140, and Pierre de Bruys and Henry his disciple, and another sort of\n",
      "erring spirits who were called the Apostolics; he confounded Arnauld de\n",
      "Brescia, darted lightning at the monk Raoul, the murderer of the Jews,\n",
      "dominated the council of Reims in 1148, caused the condemnation of\n",
      "Gilbert de Poréa, Bishop of Poitiers, caused the condemnation of Éon de\n",
      "l’Étoile, arranged the disputes of princes, enlightened King Louis the\n",
      "Young, advised Pope Eugene III., regulated the Temple, preached the\n",
      "crusade, performed two hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime,\n",
      "and as many as thirty-nine in one day. Who was Benoît? He was the\n",
      "patriarch of Mont-Cassin; he was the second founder of the Sainteté\n",
      "Claustrale, he was the Basil of the West. His order has produced forty\n",
      "popes, two hundred cardinals, fifty patriarchs, sixteen hundred\n",
      "archbishops, four thousand six hundred bishops, four emperors, twelve\n",
      "empresses, forty-six kings, forty-one queens, three thousand six\n",
      "hundred canonized saints, and has been in existence for fourteen\n",
      "hundred years. On one side Saint Bernard, on the other the agent of the\n",
      "sanitary department! On one side Saint Benoît, on the other the\n",
      "inspector of public ways! The state, the road commissioners, the public\n",
      "undertaker, regulations, the administration, what do we know of all\n",

      "Fauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath. The prioress\n",

      "\n",
      "“No one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture. Only fanatics\n",
      "and those in error deny it. We live in times of terrible confusion. We\n",
      "do not know that which it is necessary to know, and we know that which\n",
      "we should ignore. We are ignorant and impious. In this age there exist\n",
      "people who do not distinguish between the very great Saint Bernard and\n",
      "the Saint Bernard denominated of the poor Catholics, a certain good\n",
      "ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century. Others are so\n",
      "blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of Louis XVI. to the cross of\n",
      "Jesus Christ. Louis XVI. was merely a king. Let us beware of God! There\n",
      "is no longer just nor unjust. The name of Voltaire is known, but not\n",
      "the name of César de Bus. Nevertheless, César de Bus is a man of\n",
      "blessed memory, and Voltaire one of unblessed memory. The last\n",
      "arch-bishop, the Cardinal de Périgord, did not even know that Charles\n",
      "de Gondren succeeded to Berulle, and François Bourgoin to Gondren, and\n",
      "Jean-François Senault to Bourgoin, and Father Sainte-Marthe to\n",
      "Jean-François Senault. The name of Father Coton is known, not because\n",
      "he was one of the three who urged the foundation of the Oratorie, but\n",
      "because he furnished Henri IV., the Huguenot king, with the material\n",
      "for an oath. That which pleases people of the world in Saint François\n",
      "de Sales, is that he cheated at play. And then, religion is attacked.\n",
      "Why? Because there have been bad priests, because Sagittaire, Bishop of\n",
      "Gap, was the brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, and because both of\n",
      "them followed Mommol. What has that to do with the question? Does that\n",
      "prevent Martin de Tours from being a saint, and giving half of his\n",
      "cloak to a beggar? They persecute the saints. They shut their eyes to\n",
      "the truth. Darkness is the rule. The most ferocious beasts are beasts\n",
      "which are blind. No one thinks of hell as a reality. Oh! how wicked\n",
      "people are! By order of the king signifies to-day, by order of the\n",
      "revolution. One no longer knows what is due to the living or to the\n",
      "dead. A holy death is prohibited. Burial is a civil matter. This is\n",
      "horrible. Saint Leo II. wrote two special letters, one to Pierre\n",
      "Notaire, the other to the king of the Visigoths, for the purpose of\n",
      "combating and rejecting, in questions touching the dead, the authority\n",
      "of the exarch and the supremacy of the Emperor. Gauthier, Bishop of\n",
      "Châlons, held his own in this matter against Otho, Duke of Burgundy.\n",
      "The ancient magistracy agreed with him. In former times we had voices\n",
      "in the chapter, even on matters of the day. The Abbot of Cîteaux, the\n",
      "general of the order, was councillor by right of birth to the\n",
      "parliament of Burgundy. We do what we please with our dead. Is not the\n",

      "Saint Benoît-sur-Loire, although he died in Italy at Mont-Cassin, on\n",
      "Saturday, the 21st of the month of March, of the year 543? All this is\n",
      "incontestable. I abhor psalm-singers, I hate priors, I execrate\n",

      "\n",
      "The strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one-eyed\n",
      "man; they do not reach their goal very promptly. Moreover, Fauchelevent\n",
      "was in a dilemma. He took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his\n",
      "cottage in the garden. Cosette had waked up. Jean Valjean had placed\n",
      "her near the fire. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, Jean\n",
      "Valjean was pointing out to her the vintner’s basket on the wall, and\n",
      "saying to her, “Listen attentively to me, my little Cosette. We must go\n",
      "away from this house, but we shall return to it, and we shall be very\n",
      "happy here. The good man who lives here is going to carry you off on\n",
      "his back in that. You will wait for me at a lady’s house. I shall come\n",

      "Madame Thénardier to get you again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette nodded gravely.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everything is arranged, and nothing is,” said Fauchelevent. “I have\n",
      "permission to bring you in; but before bringing you in you must be got\n",
      "out. That’s where the difficulty lies. It is easy enough with the\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“But you, Father Madeleine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And, after a silence, fraught with anxiety, Fauchelevent exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, get out as you came in!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean, as in the first instance, contented himself with saying,\n",
      "“Impossible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fauchelevent grumbled, more to himself than to Jean Valjean:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is another thing which bothers me. I have said that I would put\n",
      "earth in it. When I come to think it over, the earth instead of the\n",
      "corpse will not seem like the real thing, it won’t do, it will get\n",
      "displaced, it will move about. The men will bear it. You understand,\n",
      "Father Madeleine, the government will notice it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was\n",
      "raving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fauchelevent went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“How the de—uce are you going to get out? It must all be done by\n",
      "to-morrow morning. It is to-morrow that I am to bring you in. The\n",
      "prioress expects you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he explained to Jean Valjean that this was his recompense for a\n",
      "service which he, Fauchelevent, was to render to the community. That it\n",
      "fell among his duties to take part in their burials, that he nailed up\n",
      "the coffins and helped the grave-digger at the cemetery. That the nun\n",
      "who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin\n",
      "which had served her for a bed, and interred in the vault under the\n",
      "altar of the chapel. That the police regulations forbade this, but that\n",
      "she was one of those dead to whom nothing is refused. That the prioress\n",
      "and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased. That\n",
      "it was so much the worse for the government. That he, Fauchelevent, was\n",
      "to nail up the coffin in the cell, raise the stone in the chapel, and\n",
      "lower the corpse into the vault. And that, by way of thanks, the\n",
      "prioress was to admit his brother to the house as a gardener, and his\n",
      "niece as a pupil. That his brother was M. Madeleine, and that his niece\n",
      "was Cosette. That the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the\n",
      "following evening, after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery. But\n",
      "that he could not bring M. Madeleine in from the outside if M.\n",
      "Madeleine was not outside. That that was the first problem. And then,\n",
      "that there was another: the empty coffin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that empty coffin?” asked Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fauchelevent replied:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The coffin of the administration.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What coffin? What administration?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“A nun dies. The municipal doctor comes and says, ‘A nun has died.’ The\n",
      "government sends a coffin. The next day it sends a hearse and\n",
      "undertaker’s men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery. The\n",

      "\n",
      "“You know, Fauchelevent, what you have said: ‘Mother Crucifixion is\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well?”\n",

      "Jean Valjean went on:—\n",

      "“The problem is to get out of here without being seen. This offers the\n",

      "managed? Where is this coffin?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The empty one?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“What is this dead-room?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening\n",

      "\n",
      "“When does the porter open that door?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "“Could you hide me in that room to-night when every one is asleep?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. But I could hide you in a small, dark nook which opens on the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will remain concealed in your tool-closet all night and all the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What seemed unprecedented to Fauchelevent was, we repeat, a simple\n",
      "matter to Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean had been in worse straits than\n",
      "this. Any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract\n",
      "himself to fit the diameter of the escape. The prisoner is subject to\n",
      "flight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him.\n",
      "An escape is a cure. What does not a man undergo for the sake of a\n",
      "cure? To have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale\n",
      "of goods, to live for a long time in a box, to find air where there is\n",
      "none, to economize his breath for hours, to know how to stifle without\n",
      "dying—this was one of Jean Valjean’s gloomy talents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, a coffin containing a living being,—that convict’s\n",
      "expedient,—is also an imperial expedient. If we are to credit the monk\n",
      "Austin Castillejo, this was the means employed by Charles the Fifth,\n",
      "desirous of seeing the Plombes for the last time after his abdication.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had her brought into and carried out of the monastery of Saint-Yuste\n",
      "in this manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fauchelevent, who had recovered himself a little, exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how will you manage to breathe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will breathe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“In that box! The mere thought of it suffocates me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You surely must have a gimlet, you will make a few holes here and\n",
      "there, around my mouth, and you will nail the top plank on loosely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good! And what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“A man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And Jean Valjean added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father Fauchelevent, we must come to a decision: I must either be\n",
      "caught here, or accept this escape through the hearse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and\n",
      "lounging between the two leaves of a half-shut door. Who is there who\n",
      "has not said to a cat, “Do come in!” There are men who, when an\n",
      "incident stands half-open before them, have the same tendency to halt\n",
      "in indecision between two resolutions, at the risk of getting crushed\n",

      "of the old school. The grave-digger puts the corpses in the grave, and\n",
      "I put the grave-digger in my pocket. I will tell you what will take\n",

      "you down. The priest says the prayers, makes the sign of the cross,\n",
      "sprinkles the holy water, and takes his departure. I am left alone with\n",
      "Father Mestienne. He is my friend, I tell you. One of two things will\n",

      "On the following day, as the sun was declining, the very rare\n",
      "passers-by on the Boulevard du Maine pulled off their hats to an\n",
      "old-fashioned hearse, ornamented with skulls, cross-bones, and tears.\n",
      "This hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which\n",
      "spread a large black cross, like a huge corpse with drooping arms. A\n",
      "mourning-coach, in which could be seen a priest in his surplice, and a\n",
      "choir boy in his red cap, followed. Two undertaker’s men in gray\n",
      "uniforms trimmed with black walked on the right and the left of the\n",
      "hearse. Behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer, who\n",
      "limped along. The procession was going in the direction of the\n",
      "Vaugirard cemetery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The handle of a hammer, the blade of a cold chisel, and the antennæ of\n",
      "a pair of pincers were visible, protruding from the man’s pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of\n",
      "Paris. It had its peculiar usages, just as it had its carriage entrance\n",
      "and its house door, which old people in the quarter, who clung\n",
      "tenaciously to ancient words, still called the _porte cavalière_ and\n",
      "the _porte piétonne_.16 The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Rue\n",
      "Petit-Picpus had obtained permission, as we have already stated, to be\n",
      "buried there in a corner apart, and at night, the plot of land having\n",
      "formerly belonged to their community. The grave-diggers being thus\n",
      "bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter, in\n",
      "this cemetery, they were subjected to a special discipline. The gates\n",
      "of the Paris cemeteries closed, at that epoch, at sundown, and this\n",
      "being a municipal regulation, the Vaugirard cemetery was bound by it\n",
      "like the rest. The carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous\n",
      "grated gates, adjoining a pavilion built by the architect Perronet, and\n",
      "inhabited by the door-keeper of the cemetery. These gates, therefore,\n",
      "swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun\n",
      "disappeared behind the dome of the Invalides. If any grave-digger were\n",
      "delayed after that moment in the cemetery, there was but one way for\n",
      "him to get out—his grave-digger’s card furnished by the department of\n",
      "public funerals. A sort of letter-box was constructed in the porter’s\n",
      "window. The grave-digger dropped his card into this box, the porter\n",
      "heard it fall, pulled the rope, and the small door opened. If the man\n",
      "had not his card, he mentioned his name, the porter, who was sometimes\n",
      "in bed and asleep, rose, came out and identified the man, and opened\n",
      "the gate with his key; the grave-digger stepped out, but had to pay a\n",
      "fine of fifteen francs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This cemetery, with its peculiarities outside the regulations,\n",
      "embarrassed the symmetry of the administration. It was suppressed a\n",
      "little later than 1830. The cemetery of Mont-Parnasse, called the\n",
      "Eastern cemetery, succeeded to it, and inherited that famous dram-shop\n",
      "next to the Vaugirard cemetery, which was surmounted by a quince\n",
      "painted on a board, and which formed an angle, one side on the\n",
      "drinkers’ tables, and the other on the tombs, with this sign: _Au Bon\n",
      "Coing_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery. It was\n",
      "falling into disuse. Dampness was invading it, the flowers were\n",
      "deserting it. The bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the\n",
      "Vaugirard; it hinted at poverty. Père-Lachaise if you please! to be\n",
      "buried in Père-Lachaise is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany.\n",
      "It is recognized as elegant. The Vaugirard cemetery was a venerable\n",
      "enclosure, planted like an old-fashioned French garden. Straight\n",
      "alleys, box, thuya-trees, holly, ancient tombs beneath aged\n",
      "cypress-trees, and very tall grass. In the evening it was tragic there.\n",
      "There were very lugubrious lines about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the\n",
      "black cross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery. The lame man\n",
      "who followed it was no other than Fauchelevent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interment of Mother Crucifixion in the vault under the altar, the\n",
      "exit of Cosette, the introduction of Jean Valjean to the dead-room,—all\n",
      "had been executed without difficulty, and there had been no hitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us remark in passing, that the burial of Mother Crucifixion under\n",
      "the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight. It\n",
      "is one of the faults which resemble a duty. The nuns had committed it,\n",
      "not only without difficulty, but even with the applause of their own\n",
      "consciences. In the cloister, what is called the “government” is only\n",
      "an intermeddling with authority, an interference which is always\n",
      "questionable. In the first place, the rule; as for the code, we shall\n",
      "see. Make as many laws as you please, men; but keep them for\n",
      "yourselves. The tribute to Cæsar is never anything but the remnants of\n",
      "the tribute to God. A prince is nothing in the presence of a principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame\n",
      "of mind. His twin plots, the one with the nuns, the one for the\n",
      "convent, the other against it, the other with M. Madeleine, had\n",
      "succeeded, to all appearance. Jean Valjean’s composure was one of those\n",
      "powerful tranquillities which are contagious. Fauchelevent no longer\n",
      "felt doubtful as to his success.\n",
      "\n",
      "What remained to be done was a mere nothing. Within the last two years,\n",
      "he had made good Father Mestienne, a chubby-cheeked person, drunk at\n",
      "least ten times. He played with Father Mestienne. He did what he liked\n",
      "with him. He made him dance according to his whim. Mestienne’s head\n",
      "adjusted itself to the cap of Fauchelevent’s will. Fauchelevent’s\n",
      "confidence was perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the\n",
      "cemetery, Fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse, and said half\n",
      "aloud, as he rubbed his big hands:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here’s a fine farce!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once the hearse halted; it had reached the gate. The permission\n",
      "for interment must be exhibited. The undertaker’s man addressed himself\n",
      "to the porter of the cemetery. During this colloquy, which always is\n",
      "productive of a delay of from one to two minutes, some one, a stranger,\n",
      "came and placed himself behind the hearse, beside Fauchelevent. He was\n",
      "a sort of laboring man, who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "The hearse skirted a clump of cypress-trees, quitted the grand alley,\n",
      "turned into a narrow one, entered the waste land, and plunged into a\n",
      "thicket. This indicated the immediate proximity of the place of\n",
      "sepulture. Fauchelevent slackened his pace, but he could not detain the\n",
      "hearse. Fortunately, the soil, which was light and wet with the winter\n",
      "rains, clogged the wheels and retarded its speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He approached the grave-digger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They have such a nice little Argenteuil wine,” murmured Fauchelevent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Villager,” retorted the man, “I ought not be a grave-digger. My father\n",
      "was a porter at the Prytaneum [Town-Hall]. He destined me for\n",

      "\n",
      "Here a remark becomes necessary. Fauchelevent, whatever his anguish,\n",
      "offered a drink, but he did not explain himself on one point; who was\n",
      "to pay? Generally, Fauchelevent offered and Father Mestienne paid. An\n",
      "offer of a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created\n",
      "by the new grave-digger, and it was necessary to make this offer, but\n",
      "the old gardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after\n",
      "Rabelais in the dark, and that not unintentionally. As for himself,\n",
      "Fauchelevent did not wish to pay, troubled as he was.\n",

      "“One must eat. I have accepted Father Mestienne’s reversion. One gets\n",
      "to be a philosopher when one has nearly completed his classes. To the\n",
      "labor of the hand I join the labor of the arm. I have my scrivener’s\n",

      "\n",
      "The coffin gave back a hollow sound. Fauchelevent felt himself stagger\n",
      "and on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself. He shouted\n",
      "in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to\n",
      "mingle:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Comrade! Before the _Bon Coing_ is shut!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The grave-digger took some more earth on his shovel. Fauchelevent\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Listen to me, comrade. I am the convent grave-digger, I have come to\n",

      "begin, then, by going for a drink.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And as he spoke, and clung to this desperate insistence, this\n",

      "drunk?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Provincial,” said the man, “if you positively insist upon it, I\n",

      "“It is Argenteuil wine, at six.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, come,” said the grave-digger, “you are a bell-ringer. Ding dong,\n",
      "ding dong, that’s all you know how to say. Go hang yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he threw in a second shovelful.\n",

      "if we were to plant her there without a coverlet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, as he loaded his shovel, the grave-digger bent over,\n",
      "and the pocket of his waistcoat gaped. Fauchelevent’s wild gaze fell\n",
      "mechanically into that pocket, and there it stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon; there was still light\n",
      "enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of\n",
      "that yawning pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sum total of lightning that the eye of a Picard peasant can\n",
      "contain, traversed Fauchelevent’s pupils. An idea had just occurred to\n",
      "him.\n",

      "He thrust his hand into the pocket from behind, without the\n",
      "grave-digger, who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth,\n",
      "observing it, and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom\n",
      "of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as he turned round to get the fifth, Fauchelevent looked calmly at\n",
      "him and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the way, you new man, have you your card?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "And he fumbled in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having searched one pocket, he proceeded to search the other. He passed\n",

      "“Ah, come now, conscript,” said Fauchelevent, “none of this despair.\n",
      "There is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave.\n",
      "Fifteen francs is fifteen francs, and besides, you may not be able to\n",
      "pay it. I am an old hand, you are a new one. I know all the ropes and\n",
      "the devices. I will give you some friendly advice. One thing is clear,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Fauchelevent’s hair rose upright on his head, he sprang to his feet,\n",
      "then fell back against the side of the grave, ready to swoon on the\n",
      "coffin. He stared at Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean lay there pallid and motionless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And, drawing himself up, and folding his arms with such violence that\n",
      "his clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders, he cried:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“And this is the way I save his life!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the poor man fell to sobbing. He soliloquized the while, for it is\n",
      "an error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural. Powerful emotion\n",
      "often talks aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is Father Mestienne’s fault. Why did that fool die? What need was\n",

      "expecting it? It is he who has killed M. Madeleine. Father Madeleine!\n",
      "He is in the coffin. It is quite handy. All is over. Now, is there any\n",
      "sense in these things? Ah! my God! he is dead! Well! and his little\n",
      "girl, what am I to do with her? What will the fruit-seller say? The\n",
      "idea of its being possible for a man like that to die like this! When I\n",
      "think how he put himself under that cart! Father Madeleine! Father\n",
      "Madeleine! Pardine! He was suffocated, I said so. He wouldn’t believe\n",
      "me. Well! Here’s a pretty trick to play! He is dead, that good man, the\n",
      "very best man out of all the good God’s good folks! And his little\n",
      "girl! Ah! In the first place, I won’t go back there myself. I shall\n",
      "stay here. After having done such a thing as that! What’s the use of\n",
      "being two old men, if we are two old fools! But, in the first place,\n",
      "how did he manage to enter the convent? That was the beginning of it\n",
      "all. One should not do such things. Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine!\n",

      "\n",
      "To see a corpse is alarming, to behold a resurrection is almost as much\n",
      "so. Fauchelevent became like stone, pale, haggard, overwhelmed by all\n",
      "these excesses of emotion, not knowing whether he had to do with a\n",
      "living man or a dead one, and staring at Jean Valjean, who was gazing\n",

      "\n",
      "“So you are not dead! Oh! How wise you are! I called you so much that\n",

      "vigorous and ill-tempered search. It was plain that the grave-digger\n",
      "had made a desperate search for his card, and had made everybody in the\n",

      "silently and understanding nothing. She trembled to such a degree that\n",
      "she wept. She had neither eaten nor slept. The worthy fruit-seller had\n",

      "men, Fauvent and another man, were visible as they dug side by side. An\n",

      "from the pretty. Hence a lively taste for plain girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole of this adventure increased the importance of good, old\n",
      "Fauchelevent; he won a triple success; in the eyes of Jean Valjean,\n",
      "whom he had saved and sheltered; in those of grave-digger Gribier, who\n",
      "said to himself: “He spared me that fine”; with the convent, which,\n",
      "being enabled, thanks to him, to retain the coffin of Mother\n",
      "Crucifixion under the altar, eluded Cæsar and satisfied God. There was\n",

      "As for the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was very great.\n",

      "gardeners. Upon the occasion of the archbishop’s next visit, the\n",
      "prioress recounted the affair to his Grace, making something of a\n",
      "confession at the same time, and yet boasting of her deed. On leaving\n",
      "the convent, the archbishop mentioned it with approval, and in a\n",
      "whisper to M. de Latil, Monsieur’s confessor, afterwards Archbishop of\n",
      "Reims and Cardinal. This admiration for Fauchelevent became widespread,\n",
      "for it made its way to Rome. We have seen a note addressed by the then\n",
      "reigning Pope, Leo XII., to one of his relatives, a Monsignor in the\n",
      "Nuncio’s establishment in Paris, and bearing, like himself, the name of\n",
      "Della Genga; it contained these lines: “It appears that there is in a\n",
      "convent in Paris an excellent gardener, who is also a holy man, named\n",
      "Fauvent.” Nothing of this triumph reached Fauchelevent in his hut; he\n",
      "went on grafting, weeding, and covering up his melon beds, without in\n",
      "the least suspecting his excellences and his sanctity. Neither did he\n",
      "suspect his glory, any more than a Durham or Surrey bull whose portrait\n",

      "Cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was quite natural that Cosette should think herself Jean Valjean’s\n",
      "daughter. Moreover, as she knew nothing, she could say nothing, and\n",
      "then, she would not have said anything in any case. As we have just\n",
      "observed, nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness. Cosette\n",
      "had suffered so much, that she feared everything, even to speak or to\n",
      "breathe. A single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her.\n",
      "She had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been with\n",
      "Jean Valjean. She speedily became accustomed to the convent. Only she\n",
      "regretted Catherine, but she dared not say so. Once, however, she did\n",
      "say to Jean Valjean: “Father, if I had known, I would have brought her\n",
      "away with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette had been obliged, on becoming a scholar in the convent, to don\n",
      "the garb of the pupils of the house. Jean Valjean succeeded in getting\n",
      "them to restore to him the garments which she laid aside. This was the\n",
      "same mourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quitted\n",
      "the Thénardiers’ inn. It was not very threadbare even now. Jean Valjean\n",
      "locked up these garments, plus the stockings and the shoes, with a\n",
      "quantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound, in\n",
      "a little valise which he found means of procuring. He set this valise\n",
      "on a chair near his bed, and he always carried the key about his\n",
      "person. “Father,” Cosette asked him one day, “what is there in that box\n",
      "which smells so good?”\n",
      "\n",

      "Father Fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action, in\n",
      "addition to the glory which we just mentioned, and of which he knew\n",
      "nothing; in the first place it made him happy; next, he had much less\n",
      "work, since it was shared. Lastly, as he was very fond of snuff, he\n",
      "found the presence of M. Madeleine an advantage, in that he used three\n",
      "times as much as he had done previously, and that in an infinitely more\n",
      "luxurious manner, seeing that M. Madeleine paid for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nuns did not adopt the name of Ultime; they called Jean Valjean\n",
      "_the other Fauvent_.\n",
      "\n",
      "If these holy women had possessed anything of Javert’s glance, they\n",
      "would eventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be done\n",
      "outside in the behalf of the garden, it was always the elder\n",
      "Fauchelevent, the old, the infirm, the lame man, who went, and never\n",
      "the other; but whether it is that eyes constantly fixed on God know not\n",
      "how to spy, or whether they were, by preference, occupied in keeping\n",
      "watch on each other, they paid no heed to this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, it was well for Jean Valjean that he kept close and did not\n",
      "stir out. Javert watched the quarter for more than a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "This convent was for Jean Valjean like an island surrounded by gulfs.\n",
      "Henceforth, those four walls constituted his world. He saw enough of\n",
      "the sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity, and Cosette\n",
      "enough to remain happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very sweet life began for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden, in company with\n",
      "Fauchelevent. This hovel, built of old rubbish, which was still in\n",
      "existence in 1845, was composed, as the reader already knows, of three\n",
      "chambers, all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the\n",
      "walls. The principal one had been given up, by force, for Jean Valjean\n",
      "had opposed it in vain, to M. Madeleine, by Father Fauchelevent. The\n",
      "walls of this chamber had for ornament, in addition to the two nails\n",
      "whereon to hang the knee-cap and the basket, a Royalist bank-note of\n",
      "’93, applied to the wall over the chimney-piece, and of which the\n",
      "following is an exact facsimile:—\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: Royalist Bank-note]\n",
      "\n",
      "This specimen of Vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall by the\n",
      "preceding gardener, an old Chouan, who had died in the convent, and\n",
      "whose place Fauchelevent had taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself very\n",
      "useful. He had formerly been a pruner of trees, and he gladly found\n",
      "himself a gardener once more. It will be remembered that he knew all\n",
      "sorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture. He turned these to\n",
      "advantage. Almost all the trees in the orchard were ungrafted, and\n",
      "wild. He budded them and made them produce excellent fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day. As the\n",
      "sisters were melancholy and he was kind, the child made comparisons and\n",
      "adored him. At the appointed hour she flew to the hut. When she entered\n",
      "the lowly cabin, she filled it with paradise. Jean Valjean blossomed\n",
      "out and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he\n",
      "afforded Cosette. The joy which we inspire has this charming property,\n",
      "that, far from growing meagre, like all reflections, it returns to us\n",
      "more radiant than ever. At recreation hours, Jean Valjean watched her\n",
      "running and playing in the distance, and he distinguished her laugh\n",
      "from that of the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Cosette laughed now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette’s face had even undergone a change, to a certain extent. The\n",
      "gloom had disappeared from it. A smile is the same as sunshine; it\n",
      "banishes winter from the human countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recreation over, when Cosette went into the house again, Jean Valjean\n",
      "gazed at the windows of her class-room, and at night he rose to look at\n",
      "the windows of her dormitory.\n",
      "\n",
      "God has his own ways, moreover; the convent contributed, like Cosette,\n",
      "to uphold and complete the Bishop’s work in Jean Valjean. It is certain\n",
      "that virtue adjoins pride on one side. A bridge built by the devil\n",
      "exists there. Jean Valjean had been, unconsciously, perhaps, tolerably\n",
      "near that side and that bridge, when Providence cast his lot in the\n",
      "convent of the Petit-Picpus; so long as he had compared himself only to\n",
      "the Bishop, he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained\n",
      "humble; but for some time past he had been comparing himself to men in\n",
      "general, and pride was beginning to spring up. Who knows? He might have\n",
      "ended by returning very gradually to hatred.\n",
      "\n",
      "The convent stopped him on that downward path.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the second place of captivity which he had seen. In his youth,\n",
      "in what had been for him the beginning of his life, and later on, quite\n",
      "recently again, he had beheld another,—a frightful place, a terrible\n",
      "place, whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity of\n",
      "justice, and the crime of the law. Now, after the galleys, he saw the\n",
      "cloister; and when he meditated how he had formed a part of the\n",
      "galleys, and that he now, so to speak, was a spectator of the cloister,\n",
      "he confronted the two in his own mind with anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe, and slowly\n",
      "descended the endless spirals of reverie.\n",
      "\n",
      "He recalled his former companions: how wretched they were; they rose at\n",
      "dawn, and toiled until night; hardly were they permitted to sleep; they\n",
      "lay on camp beds, where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inches\n",

      "\n",
      "There was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply, like\n",

      "passing of those barriers, the adventure accepted even at the risk of\n",
      "death, the painful and difficult ascent, all those efforts even, which\n",
      "he had made to escape from that other place of expiation, he had made\n",
      "in order to gain entrance into this one. Was this a symbol of his\n",

      "on the night of his arrival, and turned towards the spot where, as he\n",

      "life: the first, when all doors were closed and when human society\n",
      "rejected him; the second, at a moment when human society had again set\n",
      "out in pursuit of him, and when the galleys were again yawning; and\n",

      "gladly and nobly. He was kindly, abrupt, charitable, and if he had been\n",
      "rich, his turn of mind would have been magnificent. He desired that all\n",
      "which concerned him should be done in a grand manner, even his\n",

      "When M. Gillenormand lived in the Rue Servandoni, he had frequented\n",
      "many very good and very aristocratic salons. Although a bourgeois, M.\n",
      "Gillenormand was received in society. As he had a double measure of\n",
      "wit, in the first place, that which was born with him, and secondly,\n",
      "that which was attributed to him, he was even sought out and made much\n",
      "of. He never went anywhere except on condition of being the chief\n",
      "person there. There are people who will have influence at any price,\n",
      "and who will have other people busy themselves over them; when they\n",
      "cannot be oracles, they turn wags. M. Gillenormand was not of this\n",
      "nature; his domination in the Royalist salons which he frequented cost\n",
      "his self-respect nothing. He was an oracle everywhere. It had happened\n",
      "to him to hold his own against M. de Bonald, and even against M.\n",
      "Bengy-Puy-Vallée.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 1817, he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house in\n",
      "his own neighborhood, in the Rue Férou, with Madame la Baronne de T., a\n",
      "worthy and respectable person, whose husband had been Ambassador of\n",
      "France to Berlin under Louis XVI. Baron de T., who, during his\n",
      "lifetime, had gone very passionately into ecstasies and magnetic\n",
      "visions, had died bankrupt, during the emigration, leaving, as his\n",
      "entire fortune, some very curious Memoirs about Mesmer and his tub, in\n",
      "ten manuscript volumes, bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges.\n",
      "Madame de T. had not published the memoirs, out of pride, and\n",
      "maintained herself on a meagre income which had survived no one knew\n",
      "how.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame de T. lived far from the Court; “a very mixed society,” as she\n",
      "said, in a noble isolation, proud and poor. A few friends assembled\n",
      "twice a week about her widowed hearth, and these constituted a purely\n",
      "Royalist salon. They sipped tea there, and uttered groans or cries of\n",
      "horror at the century, the charter, the Bonapartists, the prostitution\n",
      "of the blue ribbon, or the Jacobinism of Louis XVIII., according as the\n",
      "wind veered towards elegy or dithyrambs; and they spoke in low tones of\n",
      "the hopes which were presented by Monsieur, afterwards Charles X.\n",
      "\n",
      "The songs of the fishwomen, in which Napoleon was called _Nicolas_,\n",
      "were received there with transports of joy. Duchesses, the most\n",
      "delicate and charming women in the world, went into ecstasies over\n",
      "couplets like the following, addressed to “the federates”:—\n",
      "\n",
      "Refoncez dans vos culottes\n",
      "Le bout d’ chemis’ qui vous pend.\n",
      "Qu’on n’ dis’ pas qu’ les patriotes\n",
      "Ont arboré l’ drapeau blanc?20\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible,\n",
      "with innocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous, with\n",
      "quatrains, with distiches even; thus, upon the Dessolles ministry, a\n",
      "moderate cabinet, of which MM. Decazes and Deserre were members:—\n",

      "Or they drew up a list of the chamber of peers, “an abominably Jacobin\n",
      "chamber,” and from this list they combined alliances of names, in such\n",
      "a manner as to form, for example, phrases like the following: _Damas.\n",
      "Sabran. Gouvion-Saint-Cyr_.—All this was done merrily. In that society,\n",

      "In the Fualdès affair, which belongs to this epoch, 1816, they took\n",
      "part for Bastide and Jausion, because Fualdès was “a Buonapartist.”\n",
      "They designated the liberals as f_riends and brothers_; this\n",
      "constituted the most deadly insult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like certain church towers, Madame de T.’s salon had two cocks. One of\n",

      "name of Valois.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for M. Gillenormand, his consideration was of absolutely first-rate\n",

      "any way with his dignity, a certain manner about him which was\n",
      "imposing, dignified, honest, and lofty, in a bourgeois fashion; and his\n",

      "charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say, were they\n",

      "these enclosures and the most humble of these houses about 1817. He\n",
      "lived there alone and solitary, silently and poorly, with a woman who\n",
      "was neither young nor old, neither homely nor pretty, neither a peasant\n",
      "nor a bourgeoise, who served him. The plot of earth which he called his\n",

      "Bodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould, for\n",
      "the cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from America and China. He\n",
      "was in his alleys from the break of day, in summer, planting, cutting,\n",
      "hoeing, watering, walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness,\n",
      "sadness, and sweetness, sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful\n",
      "for hours, listening to the song of a bird in the trees, the babble of\n",
      "a child in a house, or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip\n",
      "of a spear of grass, of which the sun made a carbuncle. His table was\n",
      "very plain, and he drank more milk than wine. A child could make him\n",
      "give way, and his servant scolded him. He was so timid that he seemed\n",
      "shy, he rarely went out, and he saw no one but the poor people who\n",
      "tapped at his pane and his curé, the Abbé Mabeuf, a good old man.\n",
      "Nevertheless, if the inhabitants of the town, or strangers, or any\n",
      "chance comers, curious to see his tulips, rang at his little cottage,\n",

      "Any one who had, at the same time, read military memoirs, biographies,\n",
      "the _Moniteur_, and the bulletins of the grand army, would have been\n",
      "struck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency, the name\n",
      "of Georges Pontmercy. When very young, this Georges Pontmercy had been\n",
      "a soldier in Saintonge’s regiment. The revolution broke out.\n",
      "Saintonge’s regiment formed a part of the army of the Rhine; for the\n",
      "old regiments of the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even\n",
      "after the fall of the monarchy, and were only divided into brigades in\n",

      "Alzey, at Mayence, where he was one of the two hundred who formed\n",
      "Houchard’s rearguard. It was the twelfth to hold its ground against the\n",
      "corps of the Prince of Hesse, behind the old rampart of Andernach, and\n",
      "only rejoined the main body of the army when the enemy’s cannon had\n",
      "opened a breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of the glacis.\n",
      "He was under Kléber at Marchiennes and at the battle of Mont-Palissel,\n",
      "where a ball from a biscaïen broke his arm. Then he passed to the\n",
      "frontier of Italy, and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended\n",
      "the Col de Tende with Joubert. Joubert was appointed its\n",
      "adjutant-general, and Pontmercy sub-lieutenant. Pontmercy was by\n",
      "Berthier’s side in the midst of the grape-shot of that day at Lodi\n",
      "which caused Bonaparte to say: “Berthier has been cannoneer, cavalier,\n",
      "and grenadier.” He beheld his old general, Joubert, fall at Novi, at\n",
      "the moment when, with uplifted sabre, he was shouting: “Forward!”\n",
      "Having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of the\n",
      "campaign, on board a pinnace which was proceeding from Genoa to some\n",
      "obscure port on the coast, he fell into a wasps’-nest of seven or eight\n",
      "English vessels. The Genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into\n",
      "the sea, to hide the soldiers between decks, and to slip along in the\n",
      "dark as a merchant vessel. Pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the\n",
      "peak, and sailed proudly past under the guns of the British frigates.\n",
      "Twenty leagues further on, his audacity having increased, he attacked\n",
      "with his pinnace, and captured a large English transport which was\n",
      "carrying troops to Sicily, and which was so loaded down with men and\n",
      "horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea. In 1805 he was\n",
      "in that Malher division which took Günzberg from the Archduke\n",
      "Ferdinand. At Weltingen he received into his arms, beneath a storm of\n",
      "bullets, Colonel Maupetit, mortally wounded at the head of the 9th\n",
      "Dragoons. He distinguished himself at Austerlitz in that admirable\n",
      "march in echelons effected under the enemy’s fire. When the cavalry of\n",
      "the Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th of the line,\n",
      "Pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the\n",
      "Guard. The Emperor gave him the cross. Pontmercy saw Wurmser at Mantua,\n",
      "Mélas, and Alexandria, Mack at Ulm, made prisoners in succession. He\n",
      "formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which Mortier\n",
      "commanded, and which captured Hamburg. Then he was transferred to the\n",
      "55th of the line, which was the old regiment of Flanders. At Eylau he\n",
      "was in the cemetery where, for the space of two hours, the heroic\n",
      "Captain Louis Hugo, the uncle of the author of this book, sustained\n",
      "alone with his company of eighty-three men every effort of the hostile\n",
      "army. Pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from that\n",
      "cemetery. He was at Friedland. Then he saw Moscow. Then La Bérésina,\n",
      "then Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden, Wachau, Leipzig, and the defiles of\n",
      "Gelenhausen; then Montmirail, Château-Thierry, Craon, the banks of the\n",
      "Marne, the banks of the Aisne, and the redoubtable position of Laon. At\n",
      "Arnay-Le-Duc, being then a captain, he put ten Cossacks to the sword,\n",
      "and saved, not his general, but his corporal. He was well slashed up on\n",
      "this occasion, and twenty-seven splinters were extracted from his left\n",
      "arm alone. Eight days before the capitulation of Paris he had just\n",
      "exchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry. He had what was\n",
      "called under the old regime, _the double hand_, that is to say, an\n",
      "equal aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier, or a\n",
      "squadron or a battalion as an officer. It is from this aptitude,\n",
      "perfected by a military education, which certain special branches of\n",
      "the service arise, the dragoons, for example, who are both cavalry-men\n",
      "and infantry at one and the same time. He accompanied Napoleon to the\n",
      "Island of Elba. At Waterloo, he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers,\n",
      "in Dubois’ brigade. It was he who captured the standard of the\n",
      "Lunenburg battalion. He came and cast the flag at the Emperor’s feet.\n",
      "He was covered with blood. While tearing down the banner he had\n",
      "received a sword-cut across his face. The Emperor, greatly pleased,\n",
      "shouted to him: “You are a colonel, you are a baron, you are an officer\n",
      "of the Legion of Honor!” Pontmercy replied: “Sire, I thank you for my\n",
      "widow.” An hour later, he fell in the ravine of Ohain. Now, who was\n",
      "this Georges Pontmercy? He was this same “brigand of the Loire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have already seen something of his history. After Waterloo,\n",
      "Pontmercy, who had been pulled out of the hollow road of Ohain, as it\n",
      "will be remembered, had succeeded in joining the army, and had dragged\n",
      "himself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the\n",
      "Loire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Restoration had placed him on half-pay, then had sent him into\n",
      "residence, that is to say, under surveillance, at Vernon. King Louis\n",
      "XVIII., regarding all that which had taken place during the Hundred\n",
      "Days as not having occurred at all, did not recognize his quality as an\n",
      "officer of the Legion of Honor, nor his grade of colonel, nor his title\n",
      "of baron. He, on his side, neglected no occasion of signing himself\n",
      "“Colonel Baron Pontmercy.” He had only an old blue coat, and he never\n",
      "went out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the\n",
      "Legion of Honor. The Attorney for the Crown had him warned that the\n",
      "authorities would prosecute him for “illegal” wearing of this\n",
      "decoration. When this notice was conveyed to him through an officious\n",
      "intermediary, Pontmercy retorted with a bitter smile: “I do not know\n",
      "whether I no longer understand French, or whether you no longer speak\n",
      "it; but the fact is that I do not understand.” Then he went out for\n",
      "eight successive days with his rosette. They dared not interfere with\n",
      "him. Two or three times the Minister of War and the general in command\n",
      "of the department wrote to him with the following address: _“A Monsieur\n",
      "le Commandant Pontmercy.” _ He sent back the letters with the seals\n",
      "unbroken. At the same moment, Napoleon at Saint Helena was treating in\n",
      "the same fashion the missives of Sir Hudson Lowe addressed to _General\n",
      "Bonaparte_. Pontmercy had ended, may we be pardoned the expression, by\n",
      "having in his mouth the same saliva as his Emperor.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same way, there were at Rome Carthaginian prisoners who refused\n",
      "to salute Flaminius, and who had a little of Hannibal’s spirit.\n",

      "One day he encountered the district-attorney in one of the streets of\n",
      "Vernon, stepped up to him, and said: “Mr. Crown Attorney, am I\n",
      "permitted to wear my scar?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He had nothing save his meagre half-pay as chief of squadron. He had\n",
      "hired the smallest house which he could find at Vernon. He lived there\n",
      "alone, we have just seen how. Under the Empire, between two wars, he\n",
      "had found time to marry Mademoiselle Gillenormand. The old bourgeois,\n",
      "thoroughly indignant at bottom, had given his consent with a sigh,\n",
      "saying: “The greatest families are forced into it.” In 1815, Madame\n",
      "Pontmercy, an admirable woman in every sense, by the way, lofty in\n",
      "sentiment and rare, and worthy of her husband, died, leaving a child.\n",
      "This child had been the colonel’s joy in his solitude; but the\n",
      "grandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson, declaring that if\n",
      "the child were not given to him he would disinherit him. The father had\n",
      "yielded in the little one’s interest, and had transferred his love to\n",
      "flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, he had renounced everything, and neither stirred up mischief\n",
      "nor conspired. He shared his thoughts between the innocent things which\n",
      "he was then doing and the great things which he had done. He passed his\n",
      "time in expecting a pink or in recalling Austerlitz.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Gillenormand kept up no relations with his son-in-law. The colonel\n",
      "was “a bandit” to him. M. Gillenormand never mentioned the colonel,\n",
      "except when he occasionally made mocking allusions to “his Baronship.”\n",
      "It had been expressly agreed that Pontmercy should never attempt to see\n",
      "his son nor to speak to him, under penalty of having the latter handed\n",
      "over to him disowned and disinherited. For the Gillenormands, Pontmercy\n",
      "was a man afflicted with the plague. They intended to bring up the\n",
      "child in their own way. Perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these\n",
      "conditions, but he submitted to them, thinking that he was doing right\n",
      "and sacrificing no one but himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inheritance of Father Gillenormand did not amount to much; but the\n",
      "inheritance of Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder was considerable.\n",
      "This aunt, who had remained unmarried, was very rich on the maternal\n",
      "side, and her sister’s son was her natural heir. The boy, whose name\n",
      "was Marius, knew that he had a father, but nothing more. No one opened\n",
      "his mouth to him about it. Nevertheless, in the society into which his\n",
      "grandfather took him, whispers, innuendoes, and winks, had eventually\n",
      "enlightened the little boy’s mind; he had finally understood something\n",
      "of the case, and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which\n",
      "were, so to speak, the air he breathed, by a sort of infiltration and\n",
      "slow penetration, he gradually came to think of his father only with\n",
      "shame and with a pain at his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was growing up in this fashion, the colonel slipped away every\n",
      "two or three months, came to Paris on the sly, like a criminal breaking\n",
      "his ban, and went and posted himself at Saint-Sulpice, at the hour when\n",
      "Aunt Gillenormand led Marius to the mass. There, trembling lest the\n",
      "aunt should turn round, concealed behind a pillar, motionless, not\n",
      "daring to breathe, he gazed at his child. The scarred veteran was\n",
      "afraid of that old spinster.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this had arisen his connection with the curé of Vernon, M. l’Abbé\n",
      "Mabeuf.\n",
      "\n",
      "That worthy priest was the brother of a warden of Saint-Sulpice, who\n",
      "had often observed this man gazing at his child, and the scar on his\n",
      "cheek, and the large tears in his eyes. That man, who had so manly an\n",
      "air, yet who was weeping like a woman, had struck the warden. That face\n",
      "had clung to his mind. One day, having gone to Vernon to see his\n",
      "brother, he had encountered Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge, and had\n",
      "recognized the man of Saint-Sulpice. The warden had mentioned the\n",
      "circumstance to the curé, and both had paid the colonel a visit, on\n",
      "some pretext or other. This visit led to others. The colonel, who had\n",
      "been extremely reserved at first, ended by opening his heart, and the\n",
      "curé and the warden finally came to know the whole history, and how\n",
      "Pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness to his child’s future. This\n",
      "caused the curé to regard him with veneration and tenderness, and the\n",
      "colonel, on his side, became fond of the curé. And moreover, when both\n",
      "are sincere and good, no men so penetrate each other, and so amalgamate\n",
      "with each other, as an old priest and an old soldier. At bottom, the\n",
      "man is the same. The one has devoted his life to his country here\n",
      "below, the other to his country on high; that is the only difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice a year, on the first of January and on St. George’s day, Marius\n",
      "wrote duty letters to his father, which were dictated by his aunt, and\n",
      "which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula; this\n",
      "was all that M. Gillenormand tolerated; and the father answered them\n",
      "with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket\n",

      "Madame de T.’s salon was all that Marius Pontmercy knew of the world.\n",
      "It was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life.\n",
      "This opening was sombre, and more cold than warmth, more night than\n",
      "day, came to him through this skylight. This child, who had been all\n",
      "joy and light on entering this strange world, soon became melancholy,\n",
      "and, what is still more contrary to his age, grave. Surrounded by all\n",
      "those singular and imposing personages, he gazed about him with serious\n",
      "amazement. Everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him.\n",
      "There were in Madame de T.’s salon some very noble ladies named Mathan,\n",
      "Noé, Lévis,—which was pronounced Lévi,—Cambis, pronounced Cambyse.\n",
      "These antique visages and these Biblical names mingled in the child’s\n",
      "mind with the Old Testament which he was learning by heart, and when\n",
      "they were all there, seated in a circle around a dying fire, sparely\n",
      "lighted by a lamp shaded with green, with their severe profiles, their\n",
      "gray or white hair, their long gowns of another age, whose lugubrious\n",
      "colors could not be distinguished, dropping, at rare intervals, words\n",
      "which were both majestic and severe, little Marius stared at them with\n",
      "frightened eyes, in the conviction that he beheld not women, but\n",
      "patriarchs and magi, not real beings, but phantoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these phantoms, priests were sometimes mingled, frequenters of\n",
      "this ancient salon, and some gentlemen; the Marquis de Sass****,\n",
      "private secretary to Madame de Berry, the Vicomte de Val***, who\n",
      "published, under the pseudonym of _Charles-Antoine_, monorhymed odes,\n",

      "and a pretty and witty wife, whose very low-necked toilettes of scarlet\n",
      "velvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows, the Marquis de C*****\n",
      "d’E******, the man in all France who best understood “proportioned\n",

      "octogenarian, the Bishop of Mirepoix, also refractory, but as a priest,\n",
      "while he was so in the capacity of a soldier. This was at Toulon. Their\n",
      "business was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and\n",
      "bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day; they\n",
      "bore away on their backs these dripping corpses, and their red\n",
      "galley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck, which\n",
      "was dry in the morning and wet at night. These tragic tales abounded in\n",

      "Ferrette, with his short breeches and his thin legs, sometimes\n",

      "billiards, and persons who, at that epoch, passed through the Rue\n",
      "M***** on summer evenings, where the hotel de Cl****** T******* then\n",

      "Bishop _in partibus_ of Caryste: “Mark, Abbé, I make a cannon.” The\n",
      "Cardinal de Cl****** T******* had been brought to Madame de T.’s by his\n",
      "most intimate friend, M. de Roquelaure, former Bishop of Senlis, and\n",
      "one of the Forty. M. de Roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and\n",

      "the curious could, on every Tuesday, contemplate the Ex-Bishop of\n",
      "Senlis, usually standing erect, freshly powdered, in violet hose, with\n",
      "his back turned to the door, apparently for the purpose of allowing a\n",
      "better view of his little collar. All these ecclesiastics, though for\n",
      "the most part as much courtiers as churchmen, added to the gravity of\n",
      "the T. salon, whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five peers of\n",
      "France, the Marquis de Vib****, the Marquis de Tal***, the Marquis de\n",
      "Herb*******, the Vicomte Damb***, and the Duc de Val********. This Duc\n",
      "de Val********, although Prince de Mon***, that is to say a reigning\n",
      "prince abroad, had so high an idea of France and its peerage, that he\n",
      "viewed everything through their medium. It was he who said: “The\n",
      "Cardinals are the peers of France of Rome; the lords are the peers of\n",
      "France of England.” Moreover, as it is indispensable that the\n",
      "Revolution should be everywhere in this century, this feudal salon was,\n",
      "as we have said, dominated by a bourgeois. M. Gillenormand reigned\n",
      "there.\n",
      "\n",
      "There lay the essence and quintessence of the Parisian white society.\n",
      "There reputations, even Royalist reputations, were held in quarantine.\n",
      "There is always a trace of anarchy in renown. Chateaubriand, had he\n",
      "entered there, would have produced the effect of Père Duchêne. Some of\n",
      "the scoffed-at did, nevertheless, penetrate thither on sufferance.\n",
      "Comte Beug*** was received there, subject to correction.\n",

      "The “noble” salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons.\n",

      "\n",
      "At Madame de T.’s the society was superior, taste was exquisite and\n",
      "haughty, under the cover of a great show of politeness. Manners there\n",
      "admitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old\n",
      "régime itself, buried but still alive. Some of these habits, especially\n",
      "in the matter of language, seem eccentric. Persons but superficially\n",
      "acquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was\n",
      "only antique. A woman was called _Madame la Générale. Madame la\n",
      "Colonelle_ was not entirely disused. The charming Madame de Léon, in\n",
      "memory, no doubt, of the Duchesses de Longueville and de Chevreuse,\n",
      "preferred this appellation to her title of Princesse. The Marquise de\n",
      "Créquy was also called _Madame la Colonelle_.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was this little high society which invented at the Tuileries the\n",
      "refinement of speaking to the King in private as _the King_, in the\n",
      "third person, and never as _Your Majesty_, the designation of _Your\n",
      "Majesty_ having been “soiled by the usurper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Men and deeds were brought to judgment there. They jeered at the age,\n",
      "which released them from the necessity of understanding it. They\n",
      "abetted each other in amazement. They communicated to each other that\n",
      "modicum of light which they possessed. Methuselah bestowed information\n",
      "on Epimenides. The deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the\n",
      "course of things. They declared that the time which had elapsed since\n",
      "Coblentz had not existed. In the same manner that Louis XVIII. was by\n",
      "the grace of God, in the five and twentieth year of his reign, the\n",
      "emigrants were, by rights, in the five and twentieth year of their\n",
      "adolescence.\n",
      "\n",
      "All was harmonious; nothing was too much alive; speech hardly amounted\n",
      "to a breath; the newspapers, agreeing with the salons, seemed a\n",
      "papyrus. There were some young people, but they were rather dead. The\n",
      "liveries in the antechamber were antiquated. These utterly obsolete\n",
      "personages were served by domestics of the same stamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all had the air of having lived a long time ago, and of\n",
      "obstinately resisting the sepulchre. Nearly the whole dictionary\n",
      "consisted of _Conserver, Conservation, Conservateur; to be in good\n",
      "odor_,—that was the point. There are, in fact, aromatics in the\n",
      "opinions of these venerable groups, and their ideas smelled of it. It\n",

      "\n",
      "To be ultra is to go beyond. It is to attack the sceptre in the name of\n",
      "the throne, and the mitre in the name of the altar; it is to ill-treat\n",
      "the thing which one is dragging, it is to kick over the traces; it is\n",
      "to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by\n",
      "heretics; it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry;\n",
      "it is to insult through excess of respect; it is to discover that the\n",
      "Pope is not sufficiently papish, that the King is not sufficiently\n",
      "royal, and that the night has too much light; it is to be discontented\n",
      "with alabaster, with snow, with the swan and the lily in the name of\n",

      "nothing but a scrap of rusty iron; the sword of Marengo was odious and\n",
      "was only a sabre. Former days did not recognize Yesterday. People no\n",

      "duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius, in addition to his motives of political antipathy, was\n",

      "“M. Pontmercy?” said Marius.\n",

      "\n",
      "She pointed to the door of a room on the ground floor; he entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that room, which was lighted by a tallow candle standing on the\n",
      "chimney-piece, there were three men, one standing erect, another\n",
      "kneeling, and one lying at full length, on the floor in his shirt. The\n",
      "one on the floor was the colonel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other two were the doctor, and the priest, who was engaged in\n",
      "prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously. As\n",
      "he had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness, he\n",
      "had written to M. Gillenormand to demand his son. The malady had grown\n",
      "worse. On the very evening of Marius’ arrival at Vernon, the colonel\n",
      "had had an attack of delirium; he had risen from his bed, in spite of\n",
      "the servant’s efforts to prevent him, crying: “My son is not coming! I\n",
      "shall go to meet him!” Then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate\n",
      "on the floor of the antechamber. He had just expired.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor had been summoned, and the curé. The doctor had arrived too\n",
      "late. The son had also arrived too late.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the dim light of the candle, a large tear could be distinguished on\n",
      "the pale and prostrate colonel’s cheek, where it had trickled from his\n",
      "dead eye. The eye was extinguished, but the tear was not yet dry. That\n",
      "tear was his son’s delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time, on that\n",
      "venerable and manly face, on those open eyes which saw not, on those\n",
      "white locks, those robust limbs, on which, here and there, brown lines,\n",
      "marking sword-thrusts, and a sort of red stars, which indicated\n",
      "bullet-holes, were visible. He contemplated that gigantic sear which\n",
      "stamped heroism on that countenance upon which God had imprinted\n",
      "goodness. He reflected that this man was his father, and that this man\n",
      "was dead, and a chill ran over him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in the\n",
      "presence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold stretched out\n",
      "in death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anguish, poignant anguish, was in that chamber. The servant-woman was\n",
      "lamenting in a corner, the curé was praying, and his sobs were audible,\n",
      "the doctor was wiping his eyes; the corpse itself was weeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor, the priest, and the woman gazed at Marius in the midst of\n",
      "their affliction without uttering a word; he was the stranger there.\n",
      "Marius, who was far too little affected, felt ashamed and embarrassed\n",
      "at his own attitude; he held his hat in his hand; and he dropped it on\n",
      "the floor, in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived\n",
      "him of the strength to hold it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, he experienced remorse, and he despised himself for\n",
      "behaving in this manner. But was it his fault? He did not love his\n",
      "father? Why should he!\n",
      "\n",
      "The colonel had left nothing. The sale of big furniture barely paid the\n",
      "expenses of his burial.\n",
      "\n",
      "The servant found a scrap of paper, which she handed to Marius. It\n",
      "contained the following, in the colonel’s handwriting:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“_For my son_.—The Emperor made me a Baron on the battle-field of\n",
      "Waterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which I\n",
      "purchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it. That he will\n",
      "be worthy of it is a matter of course.” Below, the colonel had added:\n",
      "“At that same battle of Waterloo, a sergeant saved my life. The man’s\n",
      "name was Thénardier. I think that he has recently been keeping a little\n",
      "inn, in a village in the neighborhood of Paris, at Chelles or\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius took this paper and preserved it, not out of duty to his father,\n",

      "in the heart of man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing remained of the colonel. M. Gillenormand had his sword and\n",
      "uniform sold to an old-clothes dealer. The neighbors devastated the\n",

      "nettles and weeds, and died.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius remained only forty-eight hours at Vernon. After the interment\n",
      "he returned to Paris, and applied himself again to his law studies,\n",
      "with no more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes!” went on the old man, “I do not wish you to have a bad opinion of\n",
      "me. You see, I am attached to this place. It seems to me that the mass\n",
      "is better from here. Why? I will tell you. It is from this place, that\n",

      "months, for the last ten years, since he had no other opportunity and\n",
      "no other way of seeing his child, because he was prevented by family\n",
      "arrangements. He came at the hour when he knew that his son would be\n",
      "brought to mass. The little one never suspected that his father was\n",
      "there. Perhaps he did not even know that he had a father, poor\n",
      "innocent! The father kept behind a pillar, so that he might not be\n",
      "seen. He gazed at his child and he wept. He adored that little fellow,\n",
      "poor man! I could see that. This spot has become sanctified in my\n",
      "sight, and I have contracted a habit of coming hither to listen to the\n",
      "mass. I prefer it to the stall to which I have a right, in my capacity\n",

      "He sacrificed himself in order that his son might be rich and happy\n",
      "some day. He was separated from him because of political opinions.\n",
      "Certainly, I approve of political opinions, but there are people who do\n",
      "not know where to stop. Mon Dieu! a man is not a monster because he was\n",
      "at Waterloo; a father is not separated from his child for such a reason\n",
      "as that. He was one of Bonaparte’s colonels. He is dead, I believe. He\n",
      "lived at Vernon, where I have a brother who is a curé, and his name was\n",

      "the Empire, the _Memorial de Sainte-Hélène_, all the memoirs, all the\n",
      "newspapers, the bulletins, the proclamations; he devoured everything.\n",
      "The first time that he came across his father’s name in the bulletins\n",
      "of the grand army, he had a fever for a week. He went to see the\n",
      "generals under whom Georges Pontmercy had served, among others, Comte\n",
      "H. Church-warden Mabeuf, whom he went to see again, told him about the\n",

      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile, occupied as he was with this study which absorbed all\n",
      "his moments as well as his thoughts, he hardly saw the Gillenormands at\n",
      "all. He made his appearance at meals; then they searched for him, and\n",
      "he was not to be found. Father Gillenormand smiled. “Bah! bah! He is\n",
      "just of the age for the girls!” Sometimes the old man added: “The\n",
      "deuce! I thought it was only an affair of gallantry. It seems that it\n",
      "is an affair of passion!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "At the same time, his ideas underwent an extraordinary change. The\n",

      "when his astonishment had passed off, he grew accustomed to this\n",
      "radiance, he contemplated these deeds without dizziness, he examined\n",
      "these personages without terror; the Revolution and the Empire\n",
      "presented themselves luminously, in perspective, before his mind’s eye;\n",
      "he beheld each of these groups of events and of men summed up in two\n",
      "tremendous facts: the Republic in the sovereignty of civil right\n",
      "restored to the masses, the Empire in the sovereignty of the French\n",
      "idea imposed on Europe; he beheld the grand figure of the people emerge\n",
      "from the Revolution, and the grand figure of France spring forth from\n",

      "What his dazzled state neglected in this, his first far too synthetic\n",

      "he raised his eyebrows to the top of his forehead: “Here he is passing\n",

      "was discipline in this retreat. Death appeared to him with large\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“_For my son_.—The Emperor made me a Baron on the battlefield of\n",
      "Waterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which I\n",
      "purchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it. That he will\n",
      "be worthy of it is a matter of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The feelings of father and daughter cannot be described. They felt\n",

      "word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only, M. Gillenormand said in a low voice and as though speaking to\n",

      "\n",
      "“It is the slasher’s handwriting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The aunt examined the paper, turned it about in all directions, then\n",

      "\n",
      "At the same moment a little oblong packet, enveloped in blue paper,\n",
      "fell from one of the pockets of the great-coat. Mademoiselle\n",
      "Gillenormand picked it up and unfolded the blue paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "It contained Marius’ hundred cards. She handed one of them to M.\n",
      "Gillenormand, who read: _Le Baron Marius Pontmercy_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man rang the bell. Nicolette came. M. Gillenormand took the\n",
      "ribbon, the case, and the coat, flung them all on the floor in the\n",
      "middle of the room, and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Carry those duds away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A full hour passed in the most profound silence. The old man and the\n",

      "probability.\n",

      "of his own cards in his hand, and on catching sight of him, the latter\n",
      "exclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was\n",
      "something crushing:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! well! well! well! well! so you are a baron now. I present you my\n",
      "compliments. What is the meaning of this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius reddened slightly and replied:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“It means that I am the son of my father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Gillenormand ceased to laugh, and said harshly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am your father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father,” retorted Marius, with downcast eyes and a severe air, “was\n",
      "a humble and heroic man, who served the Republic and France gloriously,\n",
      "who was great in the greatest history that men have ever made, who\n",
      "lived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century, beneath grape-shot and\n",
      "bullets, in snow and mud by day, beneath rain at night, who captured\n",
      "two flags, who received twenty wounds, who died forgotten and\n",
      "abandoned, and who never committed but one mistake, which was to love\n",
      "too fondly two ingrates, his country and myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was more than M. Gillenormand could bear to hear. At the word\n",
      "_republic_, he rose, or, to speak more correctly, he sprang to his\n",
      "feet. Every word that Marius had just uttered produced on the visage of\n",
      "the old Royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a\n",
      "blazing brand. From a dull hue he had turned red, from red, purple, and\n",
      "from purple, flame-colored.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Marius!” he cried. “Abominable child! I do not know what your father\n",
      "was! I do not wish to know! I know nothing about that, and I do not\n",
      "know him! But what I do know is, that there never was anything but\n",
      "scoundrels among those men! They were all rascals, assassins, red-caps,\n",
      "thieves! I say all! I say all! I know not one! I say all! Do you hear\n",
      "me, Marius! See here, you are no more a baron than my slipper is! They\n",
      "were all bandits in the service of Robespierre! All who served\n",
      "B-u-o-naparté were brigands! They were all traitors who betrayed,\n",
      "betrayed, betrayed their legitimate king! All cowards who fled before\n",
      "the Prussians and the English at Waterloo! That is what I do know!\n",
      "Whether Monsieur your father comes in that category, I do not know! I\n",
      "am sorry for it, so much the worse, your humble servant!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In his turn, it was Marius who was the firebrand and M. Gillenormand\n",
      "who was the bellows. Marius quivered in every limb, he did not know\n",
      "what would happen next, his brain was on fire. He was the priest who\n",
      "beholds all his sacred wafers cast to the winds, the fakir who beholds\n",
      "a passer-by spit upon his idol. It could not be that such things had\n",
      "been uttered in his presence. What was he to do? His father had just\n",
      "been trampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence, but by whom?\n",
      "By his grandfather. How was he to avenge the one without outraging the\n",
      "other? It was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it was\n",
      "equally impossible for him to leave his father unavenged. On the one\n",
      "hand was a sacred grave, on the other hoary locks.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood there for several moments, staggering as though intoxicated,\n",
      "with all this whirlwind dashing through his head; then he raised his\n",
      "eyes, gazed fixedly at his grandfather, and cried in a voice of\n",
      "thunder:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Down with the Bourbons, and that great hog of a Louis XVIII.!”\n",
      "\n",

      "him.\n",

      "wheeled round towards a bust of M. le Duc de Berry, which stood on the\n",
      "chimney-piece, and made a profound bow, with a sort of peculiar\n",
      "majesty. Then he paced twice, slowly and in silence, from the fireplace\n",
      "to the window and from the window to the fireplace, traversing the\n",
      "whole length of the room, and making the polished floor creak as though\n",
      "he had been a stone statue walking.\n",
      "\n",
      "On his second turn, he bent over his daughter, who was watching this\n",
      "encounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb, and said to her\n",
      "with a smile that was almost calm: “A baron like this gentleman, and a\n",
      "bourgeois like myself cannot remain under the same roof.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And drawing himself up, all at once, pallid, trembling, terrible, with\n",
      "his brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath, he\n",
      "extended his arm towards Marius and shouted to him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be off!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius left the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the following day, M. Gillenormand said to his daughter:\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will send sixty pistoles every six months to that blood-drinker,\n",
      "and you will never mention his name to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Having an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of, and not knowing\n",
      "what to do with it, he continued to address his daughter as _you_\n",
      "instead of _thou_ for the next three months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius, on his side, had gone forth in indignation. There was one\n",
      "circumstance which, it must be admitted, aggravated his exasperation.\n",
      "There are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domestic\n",
      "dramas. They augment the grievances in such cases, although, in\n",
      "reality, the wrongs are not increased by them. While carrying Marius’\n",

      "Nicolette had, inadvertently, let fall, probably, on the attic\n",
      "staircase, which was dark, that medallion of black shagreen which\n",
      "contained the paper penned by the colonel. Neither paper nor case could\n",
      "afterwards be found. Marius was convinced that “Monsieur\n",
      "Gillenormand”—from that day forth he never alluded to him otherwise—had\n",
      "flung “his father’s testament” in the fire. He knew by heart the few\n",
      "lines which the colonel had written, and, consequently, nothing was\n",
      "lost. But the paper, the writing, that sacred relic,—all that was his\n",
      "very heart. What had been done with it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going, and\n",
      "without knowing where, with thirty francs, his watch, and a few clothes\n",
      "in a hand-bag. He had entered a hackney-coach, had engaged it by the\n",

      "already, in some previous state of existence, traversed the\n",
      "revolutionary apocalypse. He possessed the tradition of it as though he\n",
      "had been a witness. He was acquainted with all the minute details of\n",
      "the great affair. A pontifical and warlike nature, a singular thing in\n",
      "a youth. He was an officiating priest and a man of war; from the\n",
      "immediate point of view, a soldier of the democracy; above the\n",
      "contemporary movement, the priest of the ideal. His eyes were deep, his\n",
      "lids a little red, his lower lip was thick and easily became\n",
      "disdainful, his brow was lofty. A great deal of brow in a face is like\n",
      "a great deal of horizon in a view. Like certain young men at the\n",
      "beginning of this century and the end of the last, who became\n",
      "illustrious at an early age, he was endowed with excessive youth, and\n",
      "was as rosy as a young girl, although subject to hours of pallor.\n",
      "Already a man, he still seemed a child. His two and twenty years\n",
      "appeared to be but seventeen; he was serious, it did not seem as though\n",
      "he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman. He had but one\n",

      "moved him no more than it would have moved Aristogeiton; he, like\n",
      "Harmodius, thought flowers good for nothing except to conceal the\n",
      "sword. He was severe in his enjoyments. He chastely dropped his eyes\n",
      "before everything which was not the Republic. He was the marble lover\n",
      "of liberty. His speech was harshly inspired, and had the thrill of a\n",
      "hymn. He was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul. Woe to the\n",
      "love-affair which should have risked itself beside him! If any grisette\n",
      "of the Place Cambrai or the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais, seeing that\n",

      "golden lashes, those blue eyes, that hair billowing in the wind, those\n",
      "rosy cheeks, those fresh lips, those exquisite teeth, had conceived an\n",
      "appetite for that complete aurora, and had tried her beauty on\n",
      "Enjolras, an astounding and terrible glance would have promptly shown\n",

      "By the side of Enjolras, who represented the logic of the Revolution,\n",
      "Combeferre represented its philosophy. Between the logic of the\n",
      "Revolution and its philosophy there exists this difference—that its\n",
      "logic may end in war, whereas its philosophy can end only in peace.\n",
      "Combeferre complemented and rectified Enjolras. He was less lofty, but\n",
      "broader. He desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles of\n",
      "general ideas: he said: “Revolution, but civilization”; and around the\n",
      "mountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky. The Revolution\n",
      "was more adapted for breathing with Combeferre than with Enjolras.\n",
      "Enjolras expressed its divine right, and Combeferre its natural right.\n",
      "The first attached himself to Robespierre; the second confined himself\n",
      "to Condorcet. Combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the world\n",
      "more than did Enjolras. If it had been granted to these two young men\n",
      "to attain to history, the one would have been the just, the other the\n",
      "wise man. Enjolras was the more virile, Combeferre the more humane.\n",
      "_Homo_ and _vir_, that was the exact effect of their different shades.\n",
      "Combeferre was as gentle as Enjolras was severe, through natural\n",
      "whiteness. He loved the word _citizen_, but he preferred the word\n",
      "_man_. He would gladly have said: _Hombre_, like the Spanish. He read\n",
      "everything, went to the theatres, attended the courses of public\n",
      "lecturers, learned the polarization of light from Arago, grew\n",
      "enthusiastic over a lesson in which Geoffroy Sainte-Hilaire explained\n",
      "the double function of the external carotid artery, and the internal,\n",
      "the one which makes the face, and the one which makes the brain; he\n",
      "kept up with what was going on, followed science step by step, compared\n",
      "Saint-Simon with Fourier, deciphered hieroglyphics, broke the pebble\n",
      "which he found and reasoned on geology, drew from memory a silkworm\n",
      "moth, pointed out the faulty French in the Dictionary of the Academy,\n",
      "studied Puységur and Deleuze, affirmed nothing, not even miracles;\n",
      "denied nothing, not even ghosts; turned over the files of the\n",
      "_Moniteur_, reflected. He declared that the future lies in the hand of\n",
      "the schoolmaster, and busied himself with educational questions. He\n",
      "desired that society should labor without relaxation at the elevation\n",
      "of the moral and intellectual level, at coining science, at putting\n",
      "ideas into circulation, at increasing the mind in youthful persons, and\n",
      "he feared lest the present poverty of method, the paltriness from a\n",
      "literary point of view confined to two or three centuries called\n",
      "classic, the tyrannical dogmatism of official pedants, scholastic\n",
      "prejudices and routines should end by converting our colleges into\n",
      "artificial oyster beds. He was learned, a purist, exact, a graduate of\n",
      "the Polytechnic, a close student, and at the same time, thoughtful\n",
      "“even to chimæras,” so his friends said. He believed in all dreams,\n",
      "railroads, the suppression of suffering in chirurgical operations, the\n",
      "fixing of images in the dark chamber, the electric telegraph, the\n",
      "steering of balloons. Moreover, he was not much alarmed by the citadels\n",
      "erected against the human mind in every direction, by superstition,\n",
      "despotism, and prejudice. He was one of those who think that science\n",
      "will eventually turn the position. Enjolras was a chief, Combeferre was\n",
      "a guide. One would have liked to fight under the one and to march\n",
      "behind the other. It is not that Combeferre was not capable of\n",
      "fighting, he did not refuse a hand-to-hand combat with the obstacle,\n",
      "and to attack it by main force and explosively; but it suited him\n",
      "better to bring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually,\n",
      "by means of education, the inculcation of axioms, the promulgation of\n",
      "positive laws; and, between two lights, his preference was rather for\n",
      "illumination than for conflagration. A conflagration can create an\n",
      "aurora, no doubt, but why not await the dawn? A volcano illuminates,\n",
      "but daybreak furnishes a still better illumination. Possibly,\n",
      "Combeferre preferred the whiteness of the beautiful to the blaze of the\n",
      "sublime. A light troubled by smoke, progress purchased at the expense\n",
      "of violence, only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit. The\n",
      "headlong precipitation of a people into the truth, a ‘93, terrified\n",
      "him; nevertheless, stagnation was still more repulsive to him, in it he\n",
      "detected putrefaction and death; on the whole, he preferred scum to\n",
      "miasma, and he preferred the torrent to the cesspool, and the falls of\n",
      "Niagara to the lake of Montfaucon. In short, he desired neither halt\n",
      "nor haste. While his tumultuous friends, captivated by the absolute,\n",
      "adored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures, Combeferre was\n",
      "inclined to let progress, good progress, take its own course; he may\n",
      "have been cold, but he was pure; methodical, but irreproachable;\n",
      "phlegmatic, but imperturbable. Combeferre would have knelt and clasped\n",
      "his hands to enable the future to arrive in all its candor, and that\n",
      "nothing might disturb the immense and virtuous evolution of the races.\n",
      "_The good must be innocent_, he repeated incessantly. And in fact, if\n",
      "the grandeur of the Revolution consists in keeping the dazzling ideal\n",
      "fixedly in view, and of soaring thither athwart the lightnings, with\n",
      "fire and blood in its talons, the beauty of progress lies in being\n",
      "spotless; and there exists between Washington, who represents the one,\n",
      "and Danton, who incarnates the other, that difference which separates\n",
      "the swan from the angel with the wings of an eagle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Prouvaire was a still softer shade than Combeferre. His name was\n",
      "Jehan, owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled with the\n",
      "powerful and profound movement whence sprang the very essential study\n",
      "of the Middle Ages. Jean Prouvaire was in love; he cultivated a pot of\n",
      "flowers, played on the flute, made verses, loved the people, pitied\n",
      "woman, wept over the child, confounded God and the future in the same\n",
      "confidence, and blamed the Revolution for having caused the fall of a\n",
      "royal head, that of André Chénier. His voice was ordinarily delicate,\n",
      "but suddenly grew manly. He was learned even to erudition, and almost\n",
      "an Orientalist. Above all, he was good; and, a very simple thing to\n",
      "those who know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur, in the matter\n",
      "of poetry, he preferred the immense. He knew Italian, Latin, Greek, and\n",
      "Hebrew; and these served him only for the perusal of four poets: Dante,\n",
      "Juvenal, Æschylus, and Isaiah. In French, he preferred Corneille to\n",
      "Racine, and Agrippa d’Aubigné to Corneille. He loved to saunter through\n",
      "fields of wild oats and corn-flowers, and busied himself with clouds\n",
      "nearly as much as with events. His mind had two attitudes, one on the\n",
      "side towards man, the other on that towards God; he studied or he\n",
      "contemplated. All day long, he buried himself in social questions,\n",
      "salary, capital, credit, marriage, religion, liberty of thought,\n",
      "education, penal servitude, poverty, association, property, production\n",
      "and sharing, the enigma of this lower world which covers the human\n",
      "ant-hill with darkness; and at night, he gazed upon the planets, those\n",
      "enormous beings. Like Enjolras, he was wealthy and an only son. He\n",
      "spoke softly, bowed his head, lowered his eyes, smiled with\n",
      "embarrassment, dressed badly, had an awkward air, blushed at a mere\n",
      "nothing, and was very timid. Yet he was intrepid.\n",

      "thought, to deliver the world. He had one other preoccupation, to\n",
      "educate himself; he called this also, delivering himself. He had taught\n",
      "himself to read and write; everything that he knew, he had learned by\n",
      "himself. Feuilly had a generous heart. The range of his embrace was\n",
      "immense. This orphan had adopted the peoples. As his mother had failed\n",

      "divination of the man of the people, over what we now call the _idea of\n",
      "the nationality_, had learned history with the express object of raging\n",
      "with full knowledge of the case. In this club of young Utopians,\n",
      "occupied chiefly with France, he represented the outside world. He had\n",
      "for his specialty Greece, Poland, Hungary, Roumania, Italy. He uttered\n",
      "these names incessantly, appropriately and inappropriately, with the\n",
      "tenacity of right. The violations of Turkey on Greece and Thessaly, of\n",
      "Russia on Warsaw, of Austria on Venice, enraged him. Above all things,\n",
      "the great violence of 1772 aroused him. There is no more sovereign\n",
      "eloquence than the true in indignation; he was eloquent with that\n",
      "eloquence. He was inexhaustible on that infamous date of 1772, on the\n",
      "subject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason, and that\n",
      "three-sided crime, on that monstrous ambush, the prototype and pattern\n",
      "of all those horrible suppressions of states, which, since that time,\n",
      "have struck many a noble nation, and have annulled their certificate of\n",
      "birth, so to speak. All contemporary social crimes have their origin in\n",
      "the partition of Poland. The partition of Poland is a theorem of which\n",
      "all present political outrages are the corollaries. There has not been\n",
      "a despot, nor a traitor for nearly a century back, who has not signed,\n",
      "approved, counter-signed, and copied, _ne variatur_, the partition of\n",
      "Poland. When the record of modern treasons was examined, that was the\n",
      "first thing which made its appearance. The congress of Vienna consulted\n",
      "that crime before consummating its own. 1772 sounded the onset; 1815\n",
      "was the death of the game. Such was Feuilly’s habitual text. This poor\n",
      "workingman had constituted himself the tutor of Justice, and she\n",
      "recompensed him by rendering him great. The fact is, that there is\n",
      "eternity in right. Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can be\n",
      "Teuton. Kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to make\n",
      "them so. Sooner or later, the submerged part floats to the surface and\n",
      "reappears. Greece becomes Greece again, Italy is once more Italy. The\n",
      "protest of right against the deed persists forever. The theft of a\n",

      "him; what he was building tumbled down on top of him. If he were\n",
      "splitting wood, he cut off a finger. If he had a mistress, he speedily\n",
      "discovered that he had a friend also. Some misfortune happened to him\n",
      "every moment, hence his joviality. He said: “I live under falling\n",

      "what he had foreseen, he took his bad luck serenely, and smiled at the\n",
      "teasing of fate, like a person who is listening to pleasantries. He was\n",
      "poor, but his fund of good humor was inexhaustible. He soon reached his\n",
      "last sou, never his last burst of laughter. When adversity entered his\n",
      "doors, he saluted this old acquaintance cordially, he tapped all\n",
      "catastrophes on the stomach; he was familiar with fatality to the point\n",
      "of calling it by its nickname: “Good day, Guignon,” he said to it.\n",

      "as to eat a “hundred francs” in a supper with a wench, which inspired\n",

      "south, and the foot to the north, so that, at night, the circulation of\n",
      "his blood might not be interfered with by the great electric current of\n",

      "incoherences lived in harmony together, and the result was an eccentric\n",

      "in the flesh had been, either royalists, doctrinaires, it matters not\n",
      "what; this confusion anterior to themselves, who were young, did not\n",

      "\n",
      "Among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds, there\n",
      "was one sceptic. How came he there? By juxtaposition. This sceptic’s\n",
      "name was Grantaire, and he was in the habit of signing himself with\n",
      "this rebus: R. Grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in\n",
      "anything. Moreover, he was one of the students who had learned the most\n",
      "during their course at Paris; he knew that the best coffee was to be\n",
      "had at the Café Lemblin, and the best billiards at the Café Voltaire,\n",
      "that good cakes and lasses were to be found at the Ermitage, on the\n",
      "Boulevard du Maine, spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget’s, excellent\n",
      "matelotes at the Barrière de la Cunette, and a certain thin white wine\n",
      "at the Barrière du Compat. He knew the best place for everything; in\n",
      "addition, boxing and foot-fencing and some dances; and he was a\n",
      "thorough single-stick player. He was a tremendous drinker to boot. He\n",
      "was inordinately homely: the prettiest boot-stitcher of that day, Irma\n",
      "Boissy, enraged with his homeliness, pronounced sentence on him as\n",
      "follows: “Grantaire is impossible”; but Grantaire’s fatuity was not to\n",
      "be disconcerted. He stared tenderly and fixedly at all women, with the\n",
      "air of saying to them all: “If I only chose!” and of trying to make his\n",
      "comrades believe that he was in general demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "All those words: rights of the people, rights of man, the social\n",
      "contract, the French Revolution, the Republic, democracy, humanity,\n",
      "civilization, religion, progress, came very near to signifying nothing\n",
      "whatever to Grantaire. He smiled at them. Scepticism, that caries of\n",
      "the intelligence, had not left him a single whole idea. He lived with\n",
      "irony. This was his axiom: “There is but one certainty, my full glass.”\n",
      "He sneered at all devotion in all parties, the father as well as the\n",
      "brother, Robespierre junior as well as Loizerolles. “They are greatly\n",
      "in advance to be dead,” he exclaimed. He said of the crucifix: “There\n",
      "is a gibbet which has been a success.” A rover, a gambler, a libertine,\n",
      "often drunk, he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly:\n",

      "However, this sceptic had one fanaticism. This fanaticism was neither a\n",
      "dogma, nor an idea, nor an art, nor a science; it was a man: Enjolras.\n",
      "Grantaire admired, loved, and venerated Enjolras. To whom did this\n",
      "anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds? To\n",
      "the most absolute. In what manner had Enjolras subjugated him? By his\n",
      "ideas? No. By his character. A phenomenon which is often observable. A\n",
      "sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of\n",
      "complementary colors. That which we lack attracts us. No one loves the\n",
      "light like the blind man. The dwarf adores the drum-major. The toad\n",
      "always has his eyes fixed on heaven. Why? In order to watch the bird in\n",
      "its flight. Grantaire, in whom writhed doubt, loved to watch faith soar\n",
      "in Enjolras. He had need of Enjolras. That chaste, healthy, firm,\n",
      "upright, hard, candid nature charmed him, without his being clearly\n",
      "aware of it, and without the idea of explaining it to himself having\n",
      "occurred to him. He admired his opposite by instinct. His soft,\n",
      "yielding, dislocated, sickly, shapeless ideas attached themselves to\n",
      "Enjolras as to a spinal column. His moral backbone leaned on that\n",
      "firmness. Grantaire in the presence of Enjolras became some one once\n",
      "more. He was, himself, moreover, composed of two elements, which were,\n",
      "to all appearance, incompatible. He was ironical and cordial. His\n",
      "indifference loved. His mind could get along without belief, but his\n",
      "heart could not get along without friendship. A profound contradiction;\n",
      "for an affection is a conviction. His nature was thus constituted.\n",
      "There are men who seem to be born to be the reverse, the obverse, the\n",
      "wrong side. They are Pollux, Patrocles, Nisus, Eudamidas, Ephestion,\n",
      "Pechmeja. They only exist on condition that they are backed up with\n",
      "another man; their name is a sequel, and is only written preceded by\n",
      "the conjunction _and_; and their existence is not their own; it is the\n",
      "other side of an existence which is not theirs. Grantaire was one of\n",
      "these men. He was the obverse of Enjolras.\n",
      "\n",
      "One might almost say that affinities begin with the letters of the\n",
      "alphabet. In the series O and P are inseparable. You can, at will,\n",
      "pronounce O and P or Orestes and Pylades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grantaire, Enjolras’ true satellite, inhabited this circle of young\n",
      "men; he lived there, he took no pleasure anywhere but there; he\n",
      "followed them everywhere. His joy was to see these forms go and come\n",
      "through the fumes of wine. They tolerated him on account of his good\n",
      "humor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjolras, the believer, disdained this sceptic; and, a sober man\n",
      "himself, scorned this drunkard. He accorded him a little lofty pity.\n",
      "Grantaire was an unaccepted Pylades. Always harshly treated by\n",

      "be seen leaning in a sensual manner against the doorpost of the Café\n",
      "Musain. He had the air of a caryatid on a vacation; he carried nothing\n",
      "but his reverie, however. He was staring at the Place Saint-Michel. To\n",
      "lean one’s back against a thing is equivalent to lying down while\n",
      "standing erect, which attitude is not hated by thinkers. Laigle de\n",
      "Meaux was pondering without melancholy, over a little misadventure\n",
      "which had befallen him two days previously at the law-school, and which\n",

      "Reverie does not prevent a cab from passing by, nor the dreamer from\n",

      "somnambulism, a two-wheeled vehicle proceeding through the place, at a\n",
      "foot pace and apparently in indecision. For whom was this cabriolet?\n",
      "Why was it driving at a walk? Laigle took a survey. In it, beside the\n",
      "coachman, sat a young man, and in front of the young man lay a rather\n",
      "bulky hand-bag. The bag displayed to passers-by the following name\n",
      "inscribed in large black letters on a card which was sewn to the stuff:\n",
      "MARIUS PONTMERCY.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir. Like yourself. Day before yesterday, I entered the school,\n",
      "by chance. You know, one does have such freaks sometimes. The professor\n",
      "was just calling the roll. You are not unaware that they are very\n",
      "ridiculous on such occasions. At the third call, unanswered, your name\n",

      "absent. He slyly began with the letter P. I was not listening, not\n",
      "being compromised by that letter. The call was not going badly. No\n",
      "erasures; the universe was present. Blondeau was grieved. I said to\n",
      "myself: ‘Blondeau, my love, you will not get the very smallest sort of\n",
      "an execution to-day.’ All at once Blondeau calls, ‘Marius Pontmercy!’\n",
      "No one answers. Blondeau, filled with hope, repeats more loudly:\n",
      "‘Marius Pontmercy!’ And he takes his pen. Monsieur, I have bowels of\n",
      "compassion. I said to myself hastily: ‘Here’s a brave fellow who is\n",
      "going to get scratched out. Attention. Here is a veritable mortal who\n",
      "is not exact. He’s not a good student. Here is none of your\n",
      "heavy-sides, a student who studies, a greenhorn pedant, strong on\n",
      "letters, theology, science, and sapience, one of those dull wits cut by\n",
      "the square; a pin by profession. He is an honorable idler who lounges,\n",
      "who practises country jaunts, who cultivates the grisette, who pays\n",
      "court to the fair sex, who is at this very moment, perhaps, with my\n",
      "mistress. Let us save him. Death to Blondeau!’ At that moment, Blondeau\n",
      "dipped his pen in, all black with erasures in the ink, cast his yellow\n",
      "eyes round the audience room, and repeated for the third time: ‘Marius\n",

      "\n",
      "“Nothing is more simple. I was close to the desk to reply, and close to\n",
      "the door for the purpose of flight. The professor gazed at me with a\n",
      "certain intensity. All of a sudden, Blondeau, who must be the malicious\n",
      "nose alluded to by Boileau, skipped to the letter L. L is my letter. I\n",

      "“Monsieur, Blondeau came to this fine name, and called: ‘Laigle!’ I\n",
      "reply: ‘Present!’ Then Blondeau gazes at me, with the gentleness of a\n",
      "tiger, and says to me: ‘If you are Pontmercy, you are not Laigle.’ A\n",
      "phrase which has a disobliging air for you, but which was lugubrious\n",
      "only for me. That said, he crossed me off.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“And I am delighted. I was on the brink of becoming a lawyer. This\n",
      "erasure saves me. I renounce the triumphs of the bar. I shall not\n",
      "defend the widow, and I shall not attack the orphan. No more toga, no\n",
      "more stage. Here is my erasure all ready for me. It is to you that I am\n",
      "indebted for it, Monsieur Pontmercy. I intend to pay a solemn call of\n",

      "\n",
      "“In this cab,” said Marius.\n",

      "\n",
      "On the following day, Courfeyrac introduced Marius at the Café Musain.\n",
      "Then he whispered in his ear, with a smile: “I must give you your entry\n",
      "to the revolution.” And he led him to the hall of the Friends of the A\n",

      "which Marius did not understand: “A pupil.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius had fallen into a wasps’-nest of wits. However, although he was\n",
      "silent and grave, he was, nonetheless, both winged and armed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius, up to that time solitary and inclined to soliloquy, and to\n",
      "asides, both by habit and by taste, was a little fluttered by this\n",
      "covey of young men around him. All these various initiatives solicited\n",
      "his attention at once, and pulled him about. The tumultuous movements\n",
      "of these minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl.\n",
      "Sometimes, in his trouble, they fled so far from him, that he had\n",
      "difficulty in recovering them. He heard them talk of philosophy, of\n",
      "literature, of art, of history, of religion, in unexpected fashion. He\n",
      "caught glimpses of strange aspects; and, as he did not place them in\n",
      "proper perspective, he was not altogether sure that it was not chaos\n",
      "that he grasped. On abandoning his grandfather’s opinions for the\n",
      "opinions of his father, he had supposed himself fixed; he now\n",
      "suspected, with uneasiness, and without daring to avow it to himself,\n",
      "that he was not. The angle at which he saw everything began to be\n",
      "displaced anew. A certain oscillation set all the horizons of his\n",
      "brains in motion. An odd internal upsetting. He almost suffered from\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed as though there were no “consecrated things” for those young\n",
      "men. Marius heard singular propositions on every sort of subject, which\n",
      "embarrassed his still timid mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "A theatre poster presented itself, adorned with the title of a tragedy\n",
      "from the ancient repertory called classic: “Down with tragedy dear to\n",
      "the bourgeois!” cried Bahorel. And Marius heard Combeferre reply:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are wrong, Bahorel. The bourgeoisie loves tragedy, and the\n",
      "bourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score. Bewigged tragedy has a\n",
      "reason for its existence, and I am not one of those who, by order of\n",
      "Æschylus, contest its right to existence. There are rough outlines in\n",
      "nature; there are, in creation, ready-made parodies; a beak which is\n",
      "not a beak, wings which are not wings, gills which are not gills, paws\n",
      "which are not paws, a cry of pain which arouses a desire to laugh,\n",
      "there is the duck. Now, since poultry exists by the side of the bird, I\n",

      "tragedy.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Pay attention. This is the Rue Plâtrière, now called Rue Jean-Jacques\n",
      "Rousseau, on account of a singular household which lived in it sixty\n",
      "years ago. This consisted of Jean-Jacques and Thérèse. From time to\n",
      "time, little beings were born there. Thérèse gave birth to them,\n",
      "Jean-Jacques represented them as foundlings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "One of the conversations among the young men, at which Marius was\n",
      "present and in which he sometimes joined, was a veritable shock to his\n",
      "mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "This took place in the back room of the Café Musain. Nearly all the\n",
      "Friends of the A B C had convened that evening. The argand lamp was\n",
      "solemnly lighted. They talked of one thing and another, without passion\n",
      "and with noise. With the exception of Enjolras and Marius, who held\n",
      "their peace, all were haranguing rather at hap-hazard. Conversations\n",
      "between comrades sometimes are subject to these peaceable tumults. It\n",
      "was a game and an uproar as much as a conversation. They tossed words\n",
      "to each other and caught them up in turn. They were chattering in all\n",
      "quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "No woman was admitted to this back room, except Louison, the\n",

      "Grantaire, thoroughly drunk, was deafening the corner of which he had\n",
      "taken possession, reasoning and contradicting at the top of his lungs,\n",
      "and shouting:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am thirsty. Mortals, I am dreaming: that the tun of Heidelberg has\n",
      "an attack of apoplexy, and that I am one of the dozen leeches which\n",
      "will be applied to it. I want a drink. I desire to forget life. Life is\n",
      "a hideous invention of I know not whom. It lasts no time at all, and is\n",
      "worth nothing. One breaks one’s neck in living. Life is a theatre set\n",
      "in which there are but few practicable entrances. Happiness is an\n",
      "antique reliquary painted on one side only. Ecclesiastes says: ‘All is\n",
      "vanity.’ I agree with that good man, who never existed, perhaps. Zero\n",
      "not wishing to go stark naked, clothed himself in vanity. O vanity! The\n",
      "patching up of everything with big words! a kitchen is a laboratory, a\n",
      "dancer is a professor, an acrobat is a gymnast, a boxer is a pugilist,\n",
      "an apothecary is a chemist, a wigmaker is an artist, a hodman is an\n",
      "architect, a jockey is a sportsman, a wood-louse is a pterigybranche.\n",
      "Vanity has a right and a wrong side; the right side is stupid, it is\n",
      "the negro with his glass beads; the wrong side is foolish, it is the\n",
      "philosopher with his rags. I weep over the one and I laugh over the\n",
      "other. What are called honors and dignities, and even dignity and\n",
      "honor, are generally of pinchbeck. Kings make playthings of human\n",
      "pride. Caligula made a horse a consul; Charles II. made a knight of a\n",
      "sirloin. Wrap yourself up now, then, between Consul Incitatus and\n",
      "Baronet Roastbeef. As for the intrinsic value of people, it is no\n",
      "longer respectable in the least. Listen to the panegyric which neighbor\n",
      "makes of neighbor. White on white is ferocious; if the lily could\n",
      "speak, what a setting down it would give the dove! A bigoted woman\n",
      "prating of a devout woman is more venomous than the asp and the cobra.\n",
      "It is a shame that I am ignorant, otherwise I would quote to you a mass\n",
      "of things; but I know nothing. For instance, I have always been witty;\n",

      "masculine of _rapine_. So much for myself; as for the rest of you, you\n",
      "are worth no more than I am. I scoff at your perfections, excellencies,\n",
      "and qualities. Every good quality tends towards a defect; economy\n",
      "borders on avarice, the generous man is next door to the prodigal, the\n",
      "brave man rubs elbows with the braggart; he who says very pious says a\n",

      "holes in Diogenes’ cloak. Whom do you admire, the slain or the slayer,\n",
      "Cæsar or Brutus? Generally men are in favor of the slayer. Long live\n",
      "Brutus, he has slain! There lies the virtue. Virtue, granted, but\n",
      "madness also. There are queer spots on those great men. The Brutus who\n",
      "killed Cæsar was in love with the statue of a little boy. This statue\n",
      "was from the hand of the Greek sculptor Strongylion, who also carved\n",
      "that figure of an Amazon known as the Beautiful Leg, Eucnemos, which\n",
      "Nero carried with him in his travels. This Strongylion left but two\n",
      "statues which placed Nero and Brutus in accord. Brutus was in love with\n",
      "the one, Nero with the other. All history is nothing but wearisome\n",
      "repetition. One century is the plagiarist of the other. The battle of\n",
      "Marengo copies the battle of Pydna; the Tolbiac of Clovis and the\n",
      "Austerlitz of Napoleon are as like each other as two drops of water. I\n",
      "don’t attach much importance to victory. Nothing is so stupid as to\n",
      "conquer; true glory lies in convincing. But try to prove something! If\n",
      "you are content with success, what mediocrity, and with conquering,\n",
      "what wretchedness! Alas, vanity and cowardice everywhere. Everything\n",
      "obeys success, even grammar. _Si volet usus_, says Horace. Therefore I\n",
      "disdain the human race. Shall we descend to the party at all? Do you\n",
      "wish me to begin admiring the peoples? What people, if you please?\n",
      "Shall it be Greece? The Athenians, those Parisians of days gone by,\n",

      "There stood on the great square in Corinth a statue carved by Silanion\n",
      "and catalogued by Pliny; this statue represented Episthates. What did\n",
      "Episthates do? He invented a trip. That sums up Greece and glory. Let\n",
      "us pass on to others. Shall I admire England? Shall I admire France?\n",
      "France? Why? Because of Paris? I have just told you my opinion of\n",

      "London, the metropolis of luxury, is the headquarters of wretchedness.\n",

      "moment when it is torn open with the iron, in order that grain may be\n",
      "deposited within it; it feels only the wound; the quiver of the germ\n",

      "\n",
      "Marius was gloomy. He had but just acquired a faith; must he then\n",
      "reject it already? He affirmed to himself that he would not. He\n",
      "declared to himself that he would not doubt, and he began to doubt in\n",
      "spite of himself. To stand between two religions, from one of which you\n",
      "have not as yet emerged, and another into which you have not yet\n",
      "entered, is intolerable; and twilight is pleasing only to bat-like\n",
      "souls. Marius was clear-eyed, and he required the true light. The\n",
      "half-lights of doubt pained him. Whatever may have been his desire to\n",
      "remain where he was, he could not halt there, he was irresistibly\n",
      "constrained to continue, to advance, to examine, to think, to march\n",
      "further. Whither would this lead him? He feared, after having taken so\n",
      "many steps which had brought him nearer to his father, to now take a\n",
      "step which should estrange him from that father. His discomfort was\n",
      "augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him. An escarpment\n",
      "rose around him. He was in accord neither with his grandfather nor with\n",
      "his friends; daring in the eyes of the one, he was behind the times in\n",
      "the eyes of the others, and he recognized the fact that he was doubly\n",
      "isolated, on the side of age and on the side of youth. He ceased to go\n",
      "to the Café Musain.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the troubled state of his conscience, he no longer thought of\n",

      "to him. He gave three francs a month to the old _principal tenant_ to\n",
      "come and sweep his hole, and to bring him a little hot water every\n",
      "morning, a fresh egg, and a penny roll. He breakfasted on this egg and\n",

      "Rue Saint-Jacques to dine at Rousseau’s, opposite Basset’s, the\n",
      "stamp-dealer’s, on the corner of the Rue des Mathurins. He ate no soup.\n",

      "he wished. As for wine, he drank water. When he paid at the desk where\n",
      "Madam Rousseau, at that period still plump and rosy majestically\n",

      "\n",
      "This Restaurant Rousseau, where so few bottles and so many water\n",

      "whole did not exceed six hundred and fifty francs. He was rich. He\n",
      "sometimes lent ten francs to a friend. Courfeyrac had once been able to\n",

      "master possesses only your person, a creditor possesses your dignity\n",
      "and can administer to it a box on the ear. Rather than borrow, he went\n",
      "without food. He had passed many a day fasting. Feeling that all\n",
      "extremes meet, and that, if one is not on one’s guard, lowered fortunes\n",

      "Such and such a formality or action, which, in any other situation\n",
      "would have appeared merely a deference to him, now seemed insipidity,\n",

      "terms, without attempting to approach each other, and without seeking\n",
      "to see each other. Besides, what was the use of seeing each other?\n",
      "Marius was the brass vase, while Father Gillenormand was the iron pot.\n",

      "We admit that Marius was mistaken as to his grandfather’s heart. He had\n",
      "imagined that M. Gillenormand had never loved him, and that that\n",
      "crusty, harsh, and smiling old fellow who cursed, shouted, and stormed\n",
      "and brandished his cane, cherished for him, at the most, only that\n",
      "affection, which is at once slight and severe, of the dotards of\n",
      "comedy. Marius was in error. There are fathers who do not love their\n",
      "children; there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson.\n",
      "At bottom, as we have said, M. Gillenormand idolized Marius. He\n",
      "idolized him after his own fashion, with an accompaniment of\n",
      "snappishness and boxes on the ear; but, this child once gone, he felt a\n",
      "black void in his heart; he would allow no one to mention the child to\n",
      "him, and all the while secretly regretted that he was so well obeyed.\n",
      "At first, he hoped that this Buonapartist, this Jacobin, this\n",
      "terrorist, this Septembrist, would return. But the weeks passed by,\n",
      "years passed; to M. Gillenormand’s great despair, the “blood-drinker”\n",
      "did not make his appearance. “I could not do otherwise than turn him\n",
      "out,” said the grandfather to himself, and he asked himself: “If the\n",
      "thing were to do over again, would I do it?” His pride instantly\n",
      "answered “yes,” but his aged head, which he shook in silence, replied\n",
      "sadly “no.” He had his hours of depression. He missed Marius. Old men\n",
      "need affection as they need the sun. It is warmth. Strong as his nature\n",
      "was, the absence of Marius had wrought some change in him. Nothing in\n",
      "the world could have induced him to take a step towards “that rogue”;\n",
      "but he suffered. He never inquired about him, but he thought of him\n",
      "incessantly. He lived in the Marais in a more and more retired manner;\n",
      "he was still merry and violent as of old, but his merriment had a\n",
      "convulsive harshness, and his violences always terminated in a sort of\n",
      "gentle and gloomy dejection. He sometimes said: “Oh! if he only would\n",
      "return, what a good box on the ear I would give him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As for his aunt, she thought too little to love much; Marius was no\n",
      "longer for her much more than a vague black form; and she eventually\n",
      "came to occupy herself with him much less than with the cat or the\n",
      "paroquet which she probably had. What augmented Father Gillenormand’s\n",
      "secret suffering was, that he locked it all up within his breast, and\n",
      "did not allow its existence to be divined. His sorrow was like those\n",
      "recently invented furnaces which consume their own smoke. It sometimes\n",
      "happened that officious busybodies spoke to him of Marius, and asked\n",
      "him: “What is your grandson doing?” “What has become of him?” The old\n",
      "bourgeois replied with a sigh, that he was a sad case, and giving a\n",
      "fillip to his cuff, if he wished to appear gay: “Monsieur le Baron de\n",
      "Pontmercy is practising pettifogging in some corner or other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While the old man regretted, Marius applauded himself. As is the case\n",
      "with all good-hearted people, misfortune had eradicated his bitterness.\n",
      "He only thought of M. Gillenormand in an amiable light, but he had set\n",
      "his mind on not receiving anything more from the man who _had been\n",
      "unkind to his father_. This was the mitigated translation of his first\n",
      "indignation. Moreover, he was happy at having suffered, and at\n",
      "suffering still. It was for his father’s sake. The hardness of his life\n",
      "satisfied and pleased him. He said to himself with a sort of joy that—\n",
      "_it was certainly the least he could do_; that it was an\n",
      "expiation;—that, had it not been for that, he would have been punished\n",
      "in some other way and later on for his impious indifference towards his\n",
      "father, and such a father! that it would not have been just that his\n",
      "father should have all the suffering, and he none of it; and that, in\n",
      "any case, what were his toils and his destitution compared with the\n",
      "colonel’s heroic life? that, in short, the only way for him to approach\n",
      "his father and resemble him, was to be brave in the face of indigence,\n",
      "as the other had been valiant before the enemy; and that that was, no\n",
      "doubt, what the colonel had meant to imply by the words: “He will be\n",
      "worthy of it.” Words which Marius continued to wear, not on his breast,\n",
      "since the colonel’s writing had disappeared, but in his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors,\n",
      "he had been only a child, now he was a man. He felt it. Misery, we\n",
      "repeat, had been good for him. Poverty in youth, when it succeeds, has\n",
      "this magnificent property about it, that it turns the whole will\n",
      "towards effort, and the whole soul towards aspiration. Poverty\n",
      "instantly lays material life bare and renders it hideous; hence\n",
      "inexpressible bounds towards the ideal life. The wealthy young man has\n",
      "a hundred coarse and brilliant distractions, horse races, hunting,\n",
      "dogs, tobacco, gaming, good repasts, and all the rest of it;\n",
      "occupations for the baser side of the soul, at the expense of the\n",
      "loftier and more delicate sides. The poor young man wins his bread with\n",
      "difficulty; he eats; when he has eaten, he has nothing more but\n",
      "meditation. He goes to the spectacles which God furnishes gratis; he\n",
      "gazes at the sky, space, the stars, flowers, children, the humanity\n",
      "among which he is suffering, the creation amid which he beams. He gazes\n",
      "so much on humanity that he perceives its soul, he gazes upon creation\n",
      "to such an extent that he beholds God. He dreams, he feels himself\n",
      "great; he dreams on, and feels himself tender. From the egotism of the\n",
      "man who suffers he passes to the compassion of the man who meditates.\n",
      "An admirable sentiment breaks forth in him, forgetfulness of self and\n",
      "pity for all. As he thinks of the innumerable enjoyments which nature\n",
      "offers, gives, and lavishes to souls which stand open, and refuses to\n",
      "souls that are closed, he comes to pity, he the millionnaire of the\n",
      "mind, the millionnaire of money. All hatred departs from his heart, in\n",
      "proportion as light penetrates his spirit. And is he unhappy? No. The\n",
      "misery of a young man is never miserable. The first young lad who comes\n",
      "to hand, however poor he may be, with his strength, his health, his\n",
      "rapid walk, his brilliant eyes, his warmly circulating blood, his black\n",
      "hair, his red lips, his white teeth, his pure breath, will always\n",
      "arouse the envy of an aged emperor. And then, every morning, he sets\n",
      "himself afresh to the task of earning his bread; and while his hands\n",
      "earn his bread, his dorsal column gains pride, his brain gathers ideas.\n",
      "His task finished, he returns to ineffable ecstasies, to contemplation,\n",
      "to joys; he beholds his feet set in afflictions, in obstacles, on the\n",
      "pavement, in the nettles, sometimes in the mire; his head in the light.\n",
      "He is firm, serene, gentle, peaceful, attentive, serious, content with\n",
      "little, kindly; and he thanks God for having bestowed on him those two\n",
      "forms of riches which many a rich man lacks: work, which makes him\n",
      "free; and thought, which makes him dignified.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what had happened with Marius. To tell the truth, he inclined a\n",
      "little too much to the side of contemplation. From the day when he had\n",
      "succeeded in earning his living with some approach to certainty, he had\n",
      "stopped, thinking it good to be poor, and retrenching time from his\n",
      "work to give to thought; that is to say, he sometimes passed entire\n",
      "days in meditation, absorbed, engulfed, like a visionary, in the mute\n",
      "voluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance. He had thus propounded\n",
      "the problem of his life: to toil as little as possible at material\n",
      "labor, in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is\n",
      "impalpable; in other words, to bestow a few hours on real life, and to\n",
      "cast the rest to the infinite. As he believed that he lacked nothing,\n",
      "he did not perceive that contemplation, thus understood, ends by\n",
      "becoming one of the forms of idleness; that he was contenting himself\n",
      "with conquering the first necessities of life, and that he was resting\n",
      "from his labors too soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was evident that, for this energetic and enthusiastic nature, this\n",
      "could only be a transitory state, and that, at the first shock against\n",

      "political opinions were matters of indifference to him, and he approved\n",
      "them all, without distinction, provided they left him in peace, as the\n",
      "Greeks called the Furies “the beautiful, the good, the charming,” the\n",
      "Eumenides. M. Mabeuf’s political opinion consisted in a passionate love\n",
      "for plants, and, above all, for books. Like all the rest of the world,\n",
      "he possessed the termination in _ist_, without which no one could exist\n",
      "at that time, but he was neither a Royalist, a Bonapartist, a Chartist,\n",
      "an Orleanist, nor an Anarchist; he was a _bouquinist_, a collector of\n",
      "old books. He did not understand how men could busy themselves with\n",
      "hating each other because of silly stuff like the charter, democracy,\n",
      "legitimacy, monarchy, the republic, etc., when there were in the world\n",
      "all sorts of mosses, grasses, and shrubs which they might be looking\n",
      "at, and heaps of folios, and even of 32mos, which they might turn over.\n",
      "He took good care not to become useless; having books did not prevent\n",
      "his reading, being a botanist did not prevent his being a gardener.\n",
      "When he made Pontmercy’s acquaintance, this sympathy had existed\n",
      "between the colonel and himself—that what the colonel did for flowers,\n",
      "he did for fruits. M. Mabeuf had succeeded in producing seedling pears\n",
      "as savory as the pears of St. Germain; it is from one of his\n",
      "combinations, apparently, that the October Mirabelle, now celebrated\n",
      "and no less perfumed than the summer Mirabelle, owes its origin. He\n",
      "went to mass rather from gentleness than from piety, and because, as he\n",
      "loved the faces of men, but hated their noise, he found them assembled\n",
      "and silent only in church. Feeling that he must be something in the\n",
      "State, he had chosen the career of warden. However, he had never\n",
      "succeeded in loving any woman as much as a tulip bulb, nor any man as\n",
      "much as an Elzevir. He had long passed sixty, when, one day, some one\n",
      "asked him: “Have you never been married?” “I have forgotten,” said he.\n",
      "When it sometimes happened to him—and to whom does it not happen?—to\n",
      "say: “Oh! if I were only rich!” it was not when ogling a pretty girl,\n",
      "as was the case with Father Gillenormand, but when contemplating an old\n",
      "book. He lived alone with an old housekeeper. He was somewhat gouty,\n",
      "and when he was asleep, his aged fingers, stiffened with rheumatism,\n",
      "lay crooked up in the folds of his sheets. He had composed and\n",
      "published a _Flora of the Environs of Cauteretz_, with colored plates,\n",
      "a work which enjoyed a tolerable measure of esteem and which sold well.\n",
      "People rang his bell, in the Rue Mésières, two or three times a day, to\n",
      "ask for it. He drew as much as two thousand francs a year from it; this\n",
      "constituted nearly the whole of his fortune. Although poor, he had had\n",
      "the talent to form for himself, by dint of patience, privations, and\n",
      "time, a precious collection of rare copies of every sort. He never went\n",
      "out without a book under his arm, and he often returned with two. The\n",
      "sole decoration of the four rooms on the ground floor, which composed\n",
      "his lodgings, consisted of framed herbariums, and engravings of the old\n",
      "masters. The sight of a sword or a gun chilled his blood. He had never\n",
      "approached a cannon in his life, even at the Invalides. He had a\n",
      "passable stomach, a brother who was a curé, perfectly white hair, no\n",
      "teeth, either in his mouth or his mind, a trembling in every limb, a\n",
      "Picard accent, an infantile laugh, the air of an old sheep, and he was\n",
      "easily frightened. Add to this, that he had no other friendship, no\n",
      "other acquaintance among the living, than an old bookseller of the\n",
      "Porte-Saint-Jacques, named Royal. His dream was to naturalize indigo in\n",
      "France.\n",

      "as far as man. She had never been able to get further than her cat.\n",
      "Like him, she had a moustache. Her glory consisted in her caps, which\n",

      "M. Mabeuf had taken a fancy to Marius, because Marius, being young and\n",
      "gentle, warmed his age without startling his timidity. Youth combined\n",
      "with gentleness produces on old people the effect of the sun without\n",
      "wind. When Marius was saturated with military glory, with gunpowder,\n",

      "His brother the curé died about 1830, and almost immediately, as when\n",

      "without a single purchaser. Sometimes M. Mabeuf started at the sound of\n",
      "the bell. “Monsieur,” said Mother Plutarque sadly, “it is the\n",
      "water-carrier.” In short, one day, M. Mabeuf quitted the Rue Mésières,\n",
      "abdicated the functions of warden, gave up Saint-Sulpice, sold not a\n",
      "part of his books, but of his prints,—that to which he was the least\n",
      "attached,—and installed himself in a little house on the Rue\n",
      "Montparnasse, where, however, he remained but one quarter for two\n",
      "reasons: in the first place, the ground floor and the garden cost three\n",
      "hundred francs, and he dared not spend more than two hundred francs on\n",
      "his rent; in the second, being near Faton’s shooting-gallery, he could\n",
      "hear the pistol-shots; which was intolerable to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He carried off his _Flora_, his copper-plates, his herbariums, his\n",
      "portfolios, and his books, and established himself near the\n",
      "Salpêtrière, in a sort of thatched cottage of the village of\n",
      "Austerlitz, where, for fifty crowns a year, he got three rooms and a\n",
      "garden enclosed by a hedge, and containing a well. He took advantage of\n",
      "this removal to sell off nearly all his furniture. On the day of his\n",
      "entrance into his new quarters, he was very gay, and drove the nails on\n",
      "which his engravings and herbariums were to hang, with his own hands,\n",
      "dug in his garden the rest of the day, and at night, perceiving that\n",
      "Mother Plutarque had a melancholy air, and was very thoughtful, he\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Only two visitors, the bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques and\n",

      "However, as we have just pointed out, brains which are absorbed in some\n",
      "bit of wisdom, or folly, or, as it often happens, in both at once, are\n",
      "but slowly accessible to the things of actual life. Their own destiny\n",
      "is a far-off thing to them. There results from such concentration a\n",
      "passivity, which, if it were the outcome of reasoning, would resemble\n",
      "philosophy. One declines, descends, trickles away, even crumbles away,\n",
      "and yet is hardly conscious of it one’s self. It always ends, it is\n",
      "true, in an awakening, but the awakening is tardy. In the meantime, it\n",
      "seems as though we held ourselves neutral in the game which is going on\n",
      "between our happiness and our unhappiness. We are the stake, and we\n",
      "look on at the game with indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is thus that, athwart the cloud which formed about him, when all his\n",
      "hopes were extinguished one after the other, M. Mabeuf remained rather\n",
      "puerilely, but profoundly serene. His habits of mind had the regular\n",
      "swing of a pendulum. Once mounted on an illusion, he went for a very\n",
      "long time, even after the illusion had disappeared. A clock does not\n",
      "stop short at the precise moment when the key is lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Mabeuf had his innocent pleasures. These pleasures were inexpensive\n",
      "and unexpected; the merest chance furnished them. One day, Mother\n",
      "Plutarque was reading a romance in one corner of the room. She was\n",
      "reading aloud, finding that she understood better thus. To read aloud\n",
      "is to assure one’s self of what one is reading. There are people who\n",
      "read very loud, and who have the appearance of giving themselves their\n",
      "word of honor as to what they are perusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was with this sort of energy that Mother Plutarque was reading the\n",
      "romance which she had in hand. M. Mabeuf heard her without listening to\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of her reading, Mother Plutarque came to this phrase. It\n",
      "was a question of an officer of dragoons and a beauty:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“—The beauty pouted, and the dragoon—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here she interrupted herself to wipe her glasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bouddha and the Dragon,” struck in M. Mabeuf in a low voice. “Yes, it\n",
      "is true that there was a dragon, which, from the depths of its cave,\n",
      "spouted flame through his maw and set the heavens on fire. Many stars\n",
      "had already been consumed by this monster, which, besides, had the\n",
      "claws of a tiger. Bouddha went into its den and succeeded in converting\n",

      "Courfeyrac and sought out M. Mabeuf. Very rarely, however; twice a\n",
      "month at most.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius’ pleasure consisted in taking long walks alone on the outer\n",
      "boulevards, or in the Champs-de-Mars, or in the least frequented alleys\n",
      "of the Luxembourg. He often spent half a day in gazing at a market\n",
      "garden, the beds of lettuce, the chickens on the dung-heap, the horse\n",
      "turning the water-wheel. The passers-by stared at him in surprise, and\n",
      "some of them thought his attire suspicious and his mien sinister. He\n",

      "It was during one of his strolls that he had hit upon the Gorbeau\n",

      "\n",
      "Some of his father’s old generals or old comrades had invited him to go\n",
      "and see them, when they learned about him. Marius had not refused their\n",
      "invitations. They afforded opportunities of talking about his father.\n",
      "Thus he went from time to time, to Comte Pajol, to General Bellavesne,\n",
      "to General Fririon, to the Invalides. There was music and dancing\n",
      "there. On such evenings, Marius put on his new coat. But he never went\n",
      "to these evening parties or balls except on days when it was freezing\n",
      "cold, because he could not afford a carriage, and he did not wish to\n",
      "arrive with boots otherwise than like mirrors.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said sometimes, but without bitterness: “Men are so made that in a\n",
      "drawing-room you may be soiled everywhere except on your shoes. In\n",
      "order to insure a good reception there, only one irreproachable thing\n",
      "is asked of you; your conscience? No, your boots.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All passions except those of the heart are dissipated by reverie.\n",
      "Marius’ political fevers vanished thus. The Revolution of 1830 assisted\n",
      "in the process, by satisfying and calming him. He remained the same,\n",
      "setting aside his fits of wrath. He still held the same opinions. Only,\n",
      "they had been tempered. To speak accurately, he had no longer any\n",
      "opinions, he had sympathies. To what party did he belong? To the party\n",
      "of humanity. Out of humanity he chose France; out of the Nation he\n",
      "chose the people; out of the people he chose the woman. It was to that\n",
      "point above all, that his pity was directed. Now he preferred an idea\n",
      "to a deed, a poet to a hero, and he admired a book like Job more than\n",
      "an event like Marengo. And then, when, after a day spent in meditation,\n",
      "he returned in the evening through the boulevards, and caught a glimpse\n",
      "through the branches of the trees of the fathomless space beyond, the\n",
      "nameless gleams, the abyss, the shadow, the mystery, all that which is\n",
      "only human seemed very pretty indeed to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought that he had, and he really had, in fact, arrived at the\n",
      "truth of life and of human philosophy, and he had ended by gazing at\n",
      "nothing but heaven, the only thing which Truth can perceive from the\n",
      "bottom of her well.\n",
      "\n",
      "This did not prevent him from multiplying his plans, his combinations,\n",
      "his scaffoldings, his projects for the future. In this state of\n",
      "reverie, an eye which could have cast a glance into Marius’ interior\n",
      "would have been dazzled with the purity of that soul. In fact, had it\n",
      "been given to our eyes of the flesh to gaze into the consciences of\n",
      "others, we should be able to judge a man much more surely according to\n",
      "what he dreams, than according to what he thinks. There is will in\n",
      "thought, there is none in dreams. Reverie, which is utterly\n",
      "spontaneous, takes and keeps, even in the gigantic and the ideal, the\n",
      "form of our spirit. Nothing proceeds more directly and more sincerely\n",
      "from the very depth of our soul, than our unpremeditated and boundless\n",
      "aspirations towards the splendors of destiny. In these aspirations,\n",
      "much more than in deliberate, rational co-ordinated ideas, is the real\n",
      "character of a man to be found. Our chimæras are the things which the\n",

      "well-opened and passionate nostrils, an air of calmness and sincerity,\n",
      "and with something indescribably proud, thoughtful, and innocent over\n",
      "his whole countenance. His profile, all of whose lines were rounded,\n",
      "without thereby losing their firmness, had a certain Germanic\n",
      "sweetness, which has made its way into the French physiognomy by way of\n",
      "Alsace and Lorraine, and that complete absence of angles which rendered\n",
      "the Sicambres so easily recognizable among the Romans, and which\n",

      "had all that is required to be stupid: one more turn of the key, and he\n",
      "might be sublime. His manners were reserved, cold, polished, not very\n",
      "genial. As his mouth was charming, his lips the reddest, and his teeth\n",
      "the whitest in the world, his smile corrected the severity of his face,\n",
      "as a whole. At certain moments, that pure brow and that voluptuous\n",
      "smile presented a singular contrast. His eyes were small, but his\n",

      "At the period of his most abject misery, he had observed that young\n",

      "This mute misunderstanding between him and the pretty passers-by had\n",

      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, there existed in all the immensity of creation, two women\n",
      "whom Marius did not flee, and to whom he paid no attention whatever. In\n",
      "truth, he would have been very much amazed if he had been informed that\n",
      "they were women. One was the bearded old woman who swept out his\n",
      "chamber, and caused Courfeyrac to say: “Seeing that his servant woman\n",
      "wears his beard, Marius does not wear his own beard.” The other was a\n",
      "sort of little girl whom he saw very often, and whom he never looked\n",
      "at.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more than a year, Marius had noticed in one of the walks of the\n",
      "Luxembourg, the one which skirts the parapet of the Pépinière, a man\n",
      "and a very young girl, who were almost always seated side by side on\n",
      "the same bench, at the most solitary end of the alley, on the Rue de\n",
      "l’Ouest side. Every time that that chance which meddles with the\n",
      "strolls of persons whose gaze is turned inwards, led Marius to that\n",
      "walk,—and it was nearly every day,—he found this couple there. The man\n",
      "appeared to be about sixty years of age; he seemed sad and serious; his\n",
      "whole person presented the robust and weary aspect peculiar to military\n",
      "men who have retired from the service. If he had worn a decoration,\n",
      "Marius would have said: “He is an ex-officer.” He had a kindly but\n",
      "unapproachable air, and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of\n",
      "any one. He wore blue trousers, a blue frock coat and a broad-brimmed\n",
      "hat, which always appeared to be new, a black cravat, a quaker shirt,\n",
      "that is to say, it was dazzlingly white, but of coarse linen. A\n",
      "grisette who passed near him one day, said: “Here’s a very tidy\n",
      "widower.” His hair was very white.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time that the young girl who accompanied him came and seated\n",
      "herself on the bench which they seemed to have adopted, she was a sort\n",
      "of child thirteen or fourteen years of age, so thin as to be almost\n",
      "homely, awkward, insignificant, and with a possible promise of handsome\n",
      "eyes. Only, they were always raised with a sort of displeasing\n",
      "assurance. Her dress was both aged and childish, like the dress of the\n",
      "scholars in a convent; it consisted of a badly cut gown of black\n",
      "merino. They had the air of being father and daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius scanned this old man, who was not yet aged, and this little\n",
      "girl, who was not yet a person, for a few days, and thereafter paid no\n",
      "attention to them. They, on their side, did not appear even to see him.\n",
      "They conversed together with a peaceful and indifferent air. The girl\n",
      "chattered incessantly and merrily. The old man talked but little, and,\n",
      "at times, he fixed on her eyes overflowing with an ineffable paternity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius had acquired the mechanical habit of strolling in that walk. He\n",
      "invariably found them there.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the way things went:—\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius liked to arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest from\n",
      "their bench; he walked the whole length of the alley, passed in front\n",
      "of them, then returned to the extremity whence he had come, and began\n",
      "again. This he did five or six times in the course of his promenade,\n",
      "and the promenade was taken five or six times a week, without its\n",
      "having occurred to him or to these people to exchange a greeting. That\n",
      "personage, and that young girl, although they appeared,—and perhaps\n",
      "because they appeared,—to shun all glances, had, naturally, caused some\n",
      "attention on the part of the five or six students who strolled along\n",
      "the Pépinière from time to time; the studious after their lectures, the\n",
      "others after their game of billiards. Courfeyrac, who was among the\n",
      "last, had observed them several times, but, finding the girl homely, he\n",
      "had speedily and carefully kept out of the way. He had fled,\n",
      "discharging at them a sobriquet, like a Parthian dart. Impressed solely\n",
      "with the child’s gown and the old man’s hair, he had dubbed the\n",
      "daughter Mademoiselle Lanoire, and the father, Monsieur Leblanc, so\n",
      "that as no one knew them under any other title, this nickname became a\n",
      "law in the default of any other name. The students said: “Ah! Monsieur\n",
      "Leblanc is on his bench.” And Marius, like the rest, had found it\n",
      "convenient to call this unknown gentleman Monsieur Leblanc.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shall follow their example, and we shall say M. Leblanc, in order to\n",
      "facilitate this tale.\n",
      "\n",

      "During the second year, precisely at the point in this history which\n",

      "Luxembourg was interrupted, without Marius himself being quite aware\n",
      "why, and nearly six months elapsed, during which he did not set foot in\n",
      "the alley. One day, at last, he returned thither once more; it was a\n",
      "serene summer morning, and Marius was in joyous mood, as one is when\n",
      "the weather is fine. It seemed to him that he had in his heart all the\n",
      "songs of the birds that he was listening to, and all the bits of blue\n",
      "sky of which he caught glimpses through the leaves of the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went straight to “his alley,” and when he reached the end of it he\n",
      "perceived, still on the same bench, that well-known couple. Only, when\n",
      "he approached, it certainly was the same man; but it seemed to him that\n",
      "it was no longer the same girl. The person whom he now beheld was a\n",
      "tall and beautiful creature, possessed of all the most charming lines\n",
      "of a woman at the precise moment when they are still combined with all\n",
      "the most ingenuous graces of the child; a pure and fugitive moment,\n",
      "which can be expressed only by these two words,—“fifteen years.” She\n",
      "had wonderful brown hair, shaded with threads of gold, a brow that\n",
      "seemed made of marble, cheeks that seemed made of rose-leaf, a pale\n",
      "flush, an agitated whiteness, an exquisite mouth, whence smiles darted\n",
      "like sunbeams, and words like music, a head such as Raphael would have\n",
      "given to Mary, set upon a neck that Jean Goujon would have attributed\n",
      "to a Venus. And, in order that nothing might be lacking to this\n",
      "bewitching face, her nose was not handsome—it was pretty; neither\n",
      "straight nor curved, neither Italian nor Greek; it was the Parisian\n",
      "nose, that is to say, spiritual, delicate, irregular, pure,—which\n",
      "drives painters to despair, and charms poets.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Marius passed near her, he could not see her eyes, which were\n",
      "constantly lowered. He saw only her long chestnut lashes, permeated\n",
      "with shadow and modesty.\n",
      "\n",
      "This did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listened\n",
      "to what the white-haired old man was saying to her, and nothing could\n",
      "be more fascinating than that fresh smile, combined with those drooping\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment, Marius thought that she was another daughter of the same\n",

      "his stroll brought him, for the second time, near the bench, and he had\n",
      "examined her attentively, he recognized her as the same. In six months\n",
      "the little girl had become a young maiden; that was all. Nothing is\n",
      "more frequent than this phenomenon. There is a moment when girls\n",
      "blossom out in the twinkling of an eye, and become roses all at once.\n",
      "One left them children but yesterday; today, one finds them disquieting\n",
      "to the feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "This child had not only grown, she had become idealized. As three days\n",

      "That is the result of having pocketed an income; a note fell due\n",

      "\n",

      "and simple elegance, and without affectation. She wore a dress of black\n",

      "my son, keep at an equal distance from despotism and from anarchy.”\n",
      "Marius listened to this bourgeois. Then he made the circuit of the\n",
      "basin once more. At last he directed his course towards “his alley,”\n",
      "slowly, and as if with regret. One would have said that he was both\n",
      "forced to go there and withheld from doing so. He did not perceive it\n",

      "pulled it down on his body so that there might be no wrinkles,\n",
      "examined, with a certain complaisance, the lustrous gleams of his\n",
      "trousers, and marched on the bench. This march savored of an attack,\n",
      "and certainly of a desire for conquest. So I say that he marched on the\n",
      "bench, as I should say: “Hannibal marched on Rome.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, all his movements were purely mechanical, and he had\n",

      "At that moment, he was thinking that the _Manuel du Baccalauréat_ was a\n",

      "allow of three tragedies of Racine and only one comedy of Molière being\n",

      "piercing whistling going on in his ears. As he approached the bench, he\n",
      "held fast to the folds in his coat, and fixed his eyes on the young\n",
      "girl. It seemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the\n",
      "alley with a vague blue light.\n",
      "\n",
      "In proportion as he drew near, his pace slackened more and more. On\n",
      "arriving at some little distance from the bench, and long before he had\n",
      "reached the end of the walk, he halted, and could not explain to\n",
      "himself why he retraced his steps. He did not even say to himself that\n",
      "he would not go as far as the end. It was only with difficulty that the\n",
      "young girl could have perceived him in the distance and noted his fine\n",
      "appearance in his new clothes. Nevertheless, he held himself very\n",
      "erect, in case any one should be looking at him from behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He attained the opposite end, then came back, and this time he\n",
      "approached a little nearer to the bench. He even got to within three\n",
      "intervals of trees, but there he felt an indescribable impossibility of\n",
      "proceeding further, and he hesitated. He thought he saw the young\n",
      "girl’s face bending towards him. But he exerted a manly and violent\n",
      "effort, subdued his hesitation, and walked straight ahead. A few\n",
      "seconds later, he rushed in front of the bench, erect and firm,\n",
      "reddening to the very ears, without daring to cast a glance either to\n",
      "the right or to the left, with his hand thrust into his coat like a\n",
      "statesman. At the moment when he passed,—under the cannon of the\n",
      "place,—he felt his heart beat wildly. As on the preceding day, she wore\n",
      "her damask gown and her crape bonnet. He heard an ineffable voice,\n",
      "which must have been “her voice.” She was talking tranquilly. She was\n",
      "very pretty. He felt it, although he made no attempt to see her. “She\n",

      "For the first time in fifteen months, he said to himself that that\n",

      "a bottom in this obscure sub-soil, which sometimes gives way beneath\n",
      "civilization, and which our indifference and heedlessness trample under\n",
      "foot. The Encyclopedia, in the last century, was a mine that was almost\n",
      "open to the sky. The shades, those sombre hatchers of primitive\n",
      "Christianity, only awaited an opportunity to bring about an explosion\n",

      "mine. Such and such a pick-axe with the idea, such a pick with ciphers.\n",

      "catacomb to another. Utopias travel about underground, in the pipes.\n",
      "There they branch out in every direction. They sometimes meet, and\n",
      "fraternize there. Jean-Jacques lends his pick to Diogenes, who lends\n",

      "Socinius by the hair. But nothing arrests nor interrupts the tension of\n",
      "all these energies toward the goal, and the vast, simultaneous\n",
      "activity, which goes and comes, mounts, descends, and mounts again in\n",
      "these obscurities, and which immense unknown swarming slowly transforms\n",
      "the top and the bottom and the inside and the outside. Society hardly\n",
      "even suspects this digging which leaves its surface intact and changes\n",
      "its bowels. There are as many different subterranean stages as there\n",

      "deep excavations? The future.\n",

      "The deeper one goes, the more mysterious are the toilers. The work is\n",

      "indistinct from the invisible, one perceives other gloomy men, who\n",
      "perhaps do not exist as yet. The men of yesterday are spectres; those\n",

      "Gueulemer was a Hercules of no defined position. For his lair he had\n",
      "the sewer of the Arche-Marion. He was six feet high, his pectoral\n",

      "with crow’s-feet, harsh, short hair, cheeks like a brush, a beard like\n",
      "that of a wild boar; the reader can see the man before him. His muscles\n",
      "called for work, his stupidity would have none of it. He was a great,\n",
      "idle force. He was an assassin through coolness. He was thought to be a\n",

      "\n",
      "The diaphaneity of Babet contrasted with the grossness of Gueulemer.\n",
      "Babet was thin and learned. He was transparent but impenetrable.\n",
      "Daylight was visible through his bones, but nothing through his eyes.\n",
      "He declared that he was a chemist. He had been a jack of all trades. He\n",
      "had played in vaudeville at Saint-Mihiel. He was a man of purpose, a\n",
      "fine talker, who underlined his smiles and accentuated his gestures.\n",
      "His occupation consisted in selling, in the open air, plaster busts and\n",
      "portraits of “the head of the State.” In addition to this, he extracted\n",
      "teeth. He had exhibited phenomena at fairs, and he had owned a booth\n",
      "with a trumpet and this poster: “Babet, Dental Artist, Member of the\n",
      "Academies, makes physical experiments on metals and metalloids,\n",
      "extracts teeth, undertakes stumps abandoned by his brother\n",

      "many teeth extracted as possible. He had been married and had had\n",
      "children. He did not know what had become of his wife and children. He\n",
      "had lost them as one loses his handkerchief. Babet read the papers, a\n",
      "striking exception in the world to which he belonged. One day, at the\n",
      "period when he had his family with him in his booth on wheels, he had\n",
      "read in the _Messager_, that a woman had just given birth to a child,\n",
      "who was doing well, and had a calf’s muzzle, and he exclaimed: “There’s\n",

      "with black, before he showed himself. At nightfall he emerged from the\n",
      "hole whither he returned before daylight. Where was this hole? No one\n",
      "knew. He only addressed his accomplices in the most absolute darkness,\n",
      "and with his back turned to them. Was his name Claquesous? Certainly\n",
      "not. If a candle was brought, he put on a mask. He was a ventriloquist.\n",
      "Babet said: “Claquesous is a nocturne for two voices.” Claquesous was\n",
      "vague, terrible, and a roamer. No one was sure whether he had a name,\n",
      "Claquesous being a sobriquet; none was sure that he had a voice, as his\n",

      "tuft of hair, after the style of 1829. He lived by robbery with\n",
      "violence. His coat was of the best cut, but threadbare. Montparnasse\n",
      "was a fashion-plate in misery and given to the commission of murders.\n",
      "The cause of all this youth’s crimes was the desire to be well-dressed.\n",
      "The first grisette who had said to him: “You are handsome!” had cast\n",

      "Finding that he was handsome, he desired to be elegant: now, the height\n",

      "Seine. The inventors of ideas of that nature, men with nocturnal\n",
      "imaginations, applied to them to have their ideas executed. They\n",
      "furnished the canvas to the four rascals, and the latter undertook the\n",
      "preparation of the scenery. They labored at the stage setting. They\n",
      "were always in a condition to lend a force proportioned and suitable to\n",
      "all crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder, and which were\n",
      "sufficiently lucrative. When a crime was in quest of arms, they\n",
      "under-let their accomplices. They kept a troupe of actors of the\n",

      "\n",
      "They were in the habit of assembling at nightfall, the hour when they\n",

      "Marius was too melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well, and to\n",
      "lend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed desirous\n",
      "of playing with him. It seemed to him that he was playing the part of\n",

      "the evening before, from their breathless condition, from their terror\n",
      "and from the words of slang which he had overheard, these unfortunate\n",
      "creatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession, and that the\n",
      "result of the whole was, in the midst of human society, as it is now\n",
      "constituted, two miserable beings who were neither girls nor women, a\n",
      "species of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sad creatures, without name, or sex, or age, to whom neither good nor\n",
      "evil were any longer possible, and who, on emerging from childhood,\n",
      "have already nothing in this world, neither liberty, nor virtue, nor\n",
      "responsibility. Souls which blossomed out yesterday, and are faded\n",
      "to-day, like those flowers let fall in the streets, which are soiled\n",
      "with every sort of mire, while waiting for some wheel to crush them.\n",
      "Nevertheless, while Marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her,\n",
      "the young girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the\n",
      "audacity of a spectre. She kicked about, without troubling herself as\n",
      "to her nakedness. Occasionally her chemise, which was untied and torn,\n",
      "fell almost to her waist. She moved the chairs about, she disarranged\n",
      "the toilet articles which stood on the commode, she handled Marius’\n",
      "clothes, she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo!” said she, “you have a mirror!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And she hummed scraps of vaudevilles, as though she had been alone,\n",

      "lugubrious.\n",
      "\n",
      "An indescribable constraint, weariness, and humiliation were\n",
      "perceptible beneath this hardihood. Effrontery is a disgrace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room,\n",
      "and, so to speak, flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened\n",
      "by the daylight, or which has broken its wing. One felt that under\n",
      "other conditions of education and destiny, the gay and over-free mien\n",
      "of this young girl might have turned out sweet and charming. Never,\n",
      "even among animals, does the creature born to be a dove change into an\n",
      "osprey. That is only to be seen among men.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Ah!” said she, “books!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A flash pierced her glassy eye. She resumed, and her accent expressed\n",
      "the happiness which she felt in boasting of something, to which no\n",
      "human creature is insensible:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know how to read, I do!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table, and read with\n",
      "tolerable fluency:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“—General Bauduin received orders to take the château of Hougomont\n",
      "which stands in the middle of the plain of Waterloo, with five\n",
      "battalions of his brigade.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! Waterloo! I know about that. It was a battle long ago. My father\n",
      "was there. My father has served in the armies. We are fine Bonapartists\n",
      "in our house, that we are! Waterloo was against the English.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She laid down the book, caught up a pen, and exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I know how to write, too!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She dipped her pen in the ink, and turning to Marius:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you want to see? Look here, I’m going to write a word to show you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And before he had time to answer, she wrote on a sheet of white paper,\n",
      "which lay in the middle of the table: “The bobbies are here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then throwing down the pen:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are no faults of orthography. You can look. We have received an\n",

      "were not made—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here she paused, fixed her dull eyes on Marius, and burst out laughing,\n",
      "saying, with an intonation which contained every form of anguish,\n",
      "stifled by every form of cynicism:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bah!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And she began to hum these words to a gay air:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“J’ai faim, mon père.”\n",
      "Pas de fricot.\n",

      "\n",
      "She had hardly finished this couplet, when she exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you ever go to the play, Monsieur Marius? I do. I have a little\n",
      "brother who is a friend of the artists, and who gives me tickets\n",
      "sometimes. But I don’t like the benches in the galleries. One is\n",
      "cramped and uncomfortable there. There are rough people there\n",
      "sometimes; and people who smell bad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she scrutinized Marius, assumed a singular air and said:—\n",

      "“Do you know, Mr. Marius, that you are a very handsome fellow?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both, and made\n",
      "her smile and him blush. She stepped up to him, and laid her hand on\n",
      "his shoulder: “You pay no heed to me, but I know you, Mr. Marius. I\n",
      "meet you here on the staircase, and then I often see you going to a\n",
      "person named Father Mabeuf who lives in the direction of Austerlitz,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She tried to render her voice soft, but only succeeded in making it\n",
      "very deep. A portion of her words was lost in the transit from her\n",

      "\n",
      "Marius had retreated gently.\n",
      "\n",

      "found it! On the boulevard, was it not? It must have been on the\n",
      "boulevard? You see, we let it fall when we were running. It was that\n",
      "brat of a sister of mine who was so stupid. When we got home, we could\n",
      "not find it anywhere. As we did not wish to be beaten, as that is\n",
      "useless, as that is entirely useless, as that is absolutely useless, we\n",
      "said that we had carried the letters to the proper persons, and that\n",
      "they had said to us: ‘Nix.’ So here they are, those poor letters! And\n",
      "how did you find out that they belonged to me? Ah! yes, the writing. So\n",
      "it was you that we jostled as we passed last night. We couldn’t see. I\n",
      "said to my sister: ‘Is it a gentleman?’ My sister said to me: ‘I think\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here!” said she, “this is for that old fellow who goes to mass. By the\n",

      "give us something to breakfast on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she began to laugh again, and added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today? It will\n",
      "mean that we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday,\n",
      "our breakfast of yesterday, our dinner of to-day, and all that at once,\n",

      "\n",
      "“I often go off in the evening. Sometimes I don’t come home again. Last\n",
      "winter, before we came here, we lived under the arches of the bridges.\n",
      "We huddled together to keep from freezing. My little sister cried. How\n",
      "melancholy the water is! When I thought of drowning myself, I said to\n",
      "myself: ‘No, it’s too cold.’ I go out alone, whenever I choose, I\n",
      "sometimes sleep in the ditches. Do you know, at night, when I walk\n",
      "along the boulevard, I see the trees like forks, I see houses, all\n",
      "black and as big as Notre Dame, I fancy that the white walls are the\n",

      "my ears; although it is night, I hear hand-organs and\n",

      "misery he had but just had a view of. It was its spectre which had just\n",
      "passed before his eyes. In fact, he who has only beheld the misery of\n",
      "man has seen nothing; the misery of woman is what he must see; he who\n",

      "When a man has reached his last extremity, he has reached his last\n",

      "simultaneously. The light of day seems extinguished without, the moral\n",

      "much further from the sun than ours.\n",
      "\n",
      "This young girl was to Marius a sort of messenger from the realm of sad\n",

      "Marius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of reverie and\n",
      "passion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up\n",
      "to that day. The payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement,\n",

      "better than that. What! only a wall separated him from those abandoned\n",

      "rather, rattle in the death agony beside him, and he paid no heed to\n",
      "them! Every day, every instant, he heard them walking on the other side\n",
      "of the wall, he heard them go, and come, and speak, and he did not even\n",
      "lend an ear! And groans lay in those words, and he did not even listen\n",
      "to them, his thoughts were elsewhere, given up to dreams, to impossible\n",
      "radiances, to loves in the air, to follies; and all the while, human\n",
      "creatures, his brothers in Jesus Christ, his brothers in the people,\n",
      "were agonizing in vain beside him! He even formed a part of their\n",
      "misfortune, and he aggravated it. For if they had had another neighbor\n",
      "who was less chimerical and more attentive, any ordinary and charitable\n",
      "man, evidently their indigence would have been noticed, their signals\n",
      "of distress would have been perceived, and they would have been taken\n",
      "hold of and rescued! They appeared very corrupt and very depraved, no\n",
      "doubt, very vile, very odious even; but those who fall without becoming\n",
      "degraded are rare; besides, there is a point where the unfortunate and\n",

      "paper pasted on the wall, either on the side of the Jondrettes or on\n",
      "that of Marius; the coarse construction was visible in its nakedness.\n",
      "Marius examined the partition, almost unconsciously; sometimes reverie\n",
      "examines, observes, and scrutinizes as thought would. All at once he\n",
      "sprang up; he had just perceived, near the top, close to the ceiling, a\n",

      "The plaster which should have filled this cavity was missing, and by\n",
      "mounting on the commode, a view could be had through this aperture into\n",

      "\n",
      "Marius was poor, and his chamber was poverty-stricken, but as his\n",
      "poverty was noble, his garret was neat. The den upon which his eye now\n",
      "rested was abject, dirty, fetid, pestiferous, mean, sordid. The only\n",
      "furniture consisted of a straw chair, an infirm table, some old bits of\n",
      "crockery, and in two of the corners, two indescribable pallets; all the\n",
      "light was furnished by a dormer window of four panes, draped with\n",
      "spiders’ webs. Through this aperture there penetrated just enough light\n",
      "to make the face of a man appear like the face of a phantom. The walls\n",
      "had a leprous aspect, and were covered with seams and scars, like a\n",
      "visage disfigured by some horrible malady; a repulsive moisture exuded\n",
      "from them. Obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be\n",
      "distinguished upon them.\n",

      "The chamber which Marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement;\n",

      "one virginity, that of the broom, were capriciously grouped\n",
      "constellations of old shoes, socks, and repulsive rags; however, this\n",

      "rags suspended from nails, a bird-cage, ashes, and even a little fire.\n",
      "Two brands were smouldering there in a melancholy way.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was,\n",
      "that it was large. It had projections and angles and black holes, the\n",
      "lower sides of roofs, bays, and promontories. Hence horrible,\n",
      "unfathomable nooks where it seemed as though spiders as big as one’s\n",

      "She was of that puny sort which remains backward for a long time, then\n",

      "As he laid his hand on the lock of the door, and was on the point of\n",
      "opening it, a sudden reflection caused him to pause. The corridor was\n",
      "long, the staircase steep, Jondrette was talkative, M. Leblanc had, no\n",
      "doubt, not yet regained his carriage; if, on turning round in the\n",

      "\n",
      "There was no one in the corridor. He hastened to the stairs. There was\n",
      "no one on the staircase. He descended in all haste, and reached the\n",

      "Petit-Banquier, on its way back to Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius rushed headlong in that direction. On arriving at the angle of\n",

      "the Rue Mouffetard; the carriage was already a long way off, and there\n",
      "was no means of overtaking it; what! run after it? Impossible; and\n",
      "besides, the people in the carriage would assuredly notice an\n",
      "individual running at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre, and the father\n",
      "would recognize him. At that moment, wonderful and unprecedented good\n",
      "luck, Marius perceived an empty cab passing along the boulevard. There\n",
      "was but one thing to be done, to jump into this cab and follow the\n",
      "fiacre. That was sure, efficacious, and free from danger.\n",

      "somnolent woman, and from being repulsive she became terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not possible!” she cried. “When I think that my daughters are\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean by that?” asked the woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head, winked, screwed up one eye, and raised his voice\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles\n",
      "on the boulevard.\n",

      "This is what Marius heard:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen carefully. The Crœsus is caught, or as good as caught! That’s\n",
      "all settled already. Everything is arranged. I have seen some people.\n",
      "He will come here this evening at six o’clock. To bring sixty francs,\n",
      "the rascal! Did you notice how I played that game on him, my sixty\n",
      "francs, my landlord, my fourth of February? I don’t even owe for one\n",
      "quarter! Isn’t he a fool! So he will come at six o’clock! That’s the\n",
      "hour when our neighbor goes to his dinner. Mother Bougon is off washing\n",
      "dishes in the city. There’s not a soul in the house. The neighbor never\n",
      "comes home until eleven o’clock. The children shall stand on watch. You\n",
      "shall help us. He will give in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what if he does not give in?” demanded his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jondrette made a sinister gesture, and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ll fix him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "cap, which he placed on his head, after brushing it with his sleeve.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers, he stood\n",
      "for a moment in thought, then exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know, it’s mighty lucky, by the way, that he didn’t recognize\n",
      "me! If he had recognized me on his side, he would not have come back\n",
      "again. He would have slipped through our fingers! It was my beard that\n",
      "saved us! my romantic beard! my pretty little romantic beard!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And again he broke into a laugh.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“It’s as good as a warrant for each one, of five hundred balls, and the\n",
      "worst that can happen is five years, six years, ten years at the most!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "otherwise than by sight, was to be inveigled into a trap that very\n",
      "evening; that, as he occupied the room adjoining the den, he, Marius\n",

      "that the wretch who had planned the trap was a certain Jondrette; that\n",
      "there would be accomplices, probably some prowlers of the barriers,\n",
      "among others a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille;\n",
      "that Jondrette’s daughters were to lie in wait; that there was no way\n",
      "of warning the threatened man, since he did not even know his name; and\n",
      "that, finally, all this was to be carried out at six o’clock that\n",

      "countermanding the vaudeville. They are so modest! An audience\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "The inspector stared still more intently at Marius, and continued with\n",
      "sententious solemnity:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, you speak like a brave man, and like an honest man. Courage\n",

      "\n",
      "“Take these. Go home. Hide in your chamber, so that you may be supposed\n",
      "to have gone out. They are loaded. Each one carries two balls. You will\n",
      "keep watch; there is a hole in the wall, as you have informed me. These\n",
      "men will come. Leave them to their own devices for a time. When you\n",
      "think matters have reached a crisis, and that it is time to put a stop\n",
      "to them, fire a shot. Not too soon. The rest concerns me. A shot into\n",
      "the ceiling, the air, no matter where. Above all things, not too soon.\n",
      "Wait until they begin to put their project into execution; you are a\n",

      "\n",
      "A man, in fact, wearing a gray cap, and whose gray beard could be\n",

      "already held by a glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "He quitted the Rue Mouffetard, and Marius saw him enter one of the most\n",
      "terrible hovels in the Rue Gracieuse; he remained there about a quarter\n",
      "of an hour, then returned to the Rue Mouffetard. He halted at an\n",
      "ironmonger’s shop, which then stood at the corner of the Rue\n",
      "Pierre-Lombard, and a few minutes later Marius saw him emerge from the\n",
      "shop, holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle,\n",
      "which he concealed beneath his great-coat. At the top of the Rue\n",
      "Petit-Gentilly he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the Rue\n",
      "du Petit-Banquier. The day was declining; the snow, which had ceased\n",
      "for a moment, had just begun again. Marius posted himself on the watch\n",
      "at the very corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, which was deserted, as\n",
      "usual, and did not follow Jondrette into it. It was lucky that he did\n",
      "so, for, on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where Marius had heard\n",
      "the long-haired man and the bearded man conversing, Jondrette turned\n",
      "round, made sure that no one was following him, did not see him, then\n",
      "sprang across the wall and disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "The waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back yard of\n",

      "Bougon when she set out for her dish-washing in town, had a habit of\n",
      "locking the door, which was always closed at dusk. Marius had given his\n",
      "key to the inspector of police; it was important, therefore, that he\n",
      "should make haste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evening had arrived, night had almost closed in; on the horizon and in\n",
      "the immensity of space, there remained but one spot illuminated by the\n",

      "It was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of Salpêtrière.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius returned to No. 50-52 with great strides. The door was still\n",
      "open when he arrived. He mounted the stairs on tip-toe and glided along\n",
      "the wall of the corridor to his chamber. This corridor, as the reader\n",
      "will remember, was bordered on both sides by attics, all of which were,\n",
      "for the moment, empty and to let. Ma’am Bougon was in the habit of\n",
      "leaving all the doors open. As he passed one of these attics, Marius\n",
      "thought he perceived in the uninhabited cell the motionless heads of\n",
      "four men, vaguely lighted up by a remnant of daylight, falling through\n",
      "a dormer window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius made no attempt to see, not wishing to be seen himself. He\n",
      "succeeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without making\n",

      "more repulsive in this light.\n",
      "\n",
      "She walked straight up to the bed. Marius endured an indescribable\n",
      "moment of anxiety; but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the\n",
      "wall, and it was thither that she was directing her steps. She raised\n",
      "herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it. In the neighboring room,\n",
      "the sound of iron articles being moved was audible.\n",
      "\n",
      "She smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand, and smiled into the\n",

      "\n",

      "scrutinizing herself full-face and three-quarters face in turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” cried her father, “what are you about there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am looking under the bed and the furniture,” she replied, continuing\n",
      "to arrange her hair; “there’s no one here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Booby!” yelled her father. “Come here this minute! And don’t waste any\n",

      "A moment more, and Marius heard the sound of the two young girls’ bare\n",

      "\n",
      "“Pay strict heed! One on the side of the barrier, the other at the\n",

      "Marius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume his\n",

      "\n",
      "He looked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interior of the Jondrette apartment presented a curious aspect, and\n",
      "Marius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed.\n",
      "A candle was burning in a candlestick covered with verdigris, but that\n",
      "was not what really lighted the chamber. The hovel was completely\n",
      "illuminated, as it were, by the reflection from a rather large\n",
      "sheet-iron brazier standing in the fireplace, and filled with burning\n",
      "charcoal, the brazier prepared by the Jondrette woman that morning. The\n",
      "charcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was red; a blue flame\n",
      "flickered over it, and helped him to make out the form of the chisel\n",
      "purchased by Jondrette in the Rue Pierre-Lombard, where it had been\n",
      "thrust into the brazier to heat. In one corner, near the door, and as\n",
      "though prepared for some definite use, two heaps were visible, which\n",
      "appeared to be, the one a heap of old iron, the other a heap of ropes.\n",
      "All this would have caused the mind of a person who knew nothing of\n",
      "what was in preparation, to waver between a very sinister and a very\n",
      "simple idea. The lair thus lighted up more resembled a forge than a\n",
      "mouth of hell, but Jondrette, in this light, had rather the air of a\n",
      "demon than of a smith.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heat of the brazier was so great, that the candle on the table was\n",
      "melting on the side next the chafing-dish, and was drooping over. An\n",
      "old dark-lantern of copper, worthy of Diogenes turned Cartouche, stood\n",
      "on the chimney-piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brazier, placed in the fireplace itself, beside the nearly extinct\n",
      "brands, sent its vapors up the chimney, and gave out no odor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moon, entering through the four panes of the window, cast its\n",
      "whiteness into the crimson and flaming garret; and to the poetic spirit\n",
      "of Marius, who was dreamy even in the moment of action, it was like a\n",
      "thought of heaven mingled with the misshapen reveries of earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "A breath of air which made its way in through the open pane, helped to\n",

      "brazier.\n",

      "The Jondrette lair was, if the reader recalls what we have said of the\n",
      "Gorbeau building, admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violent\n",
      "and sombre deed, and as the envelope for a crime. It was the most\n",
      "retired chamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted\n",
      "boulevard in Paris. If the system of ambush and traps had not already\n",

      "If Marius had been Courfeyrac, that is to say, one of those men who\n",
      "laugh on every occasion in life, he would have burst with laughter when\n",

      "plumes not unlike the hats of the heralds-at-arms at the coronation of\n",
      "Charles X., an immense tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat, and the\n",
      "man’s shoes which her daughter had scorned in the morning. It was this\n",

      "As for Jondrette, he had not taken off the new surtout, which was too\n",

      "constituted the ideal of a poet in Courfeyrac’s eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once, Jondrette lifted up his voice:—\n",

      "which masked the chafing-dish, then went to the corner where lay the\n",
      "pile of rope, and bent down as though to examine something. Marius then\n",
      "recognized the fact, that what he had taken for a shapeless mass was a\n",

      "by the candle; the smallest bit of crockery on the table or on the\n",
      "chimney-piece cast a large shadow. There was something indescribably\n",
      "calm, threatening, and hideous about this chamber. One felt that there\n",

      "\n",
      "Jondrette had allowed his pipe to go out, a serious sign of\n",
      "preoccupation, and had again seated himself. The candle brought out the\n",
      "fierce and the fine angles of his countenance. He indulged in scowls\n",
      "and in abrupt unfoldings of the right hand, as though he were\n",
      "responding to the last counsels of a sombre inward monologue. In the\n",
      "course of one of these dark replies which he was making to himself, he\n",
      "pulled the table drawer rapidly towards him, took out a long kitchen\n",

      "of the Salpêtrière covered with snow and white as winding-sheets in the\n",
      "moonlight, the taper-like lights of the street lanterns which shone\n",
      "redly here and there along those tragic boulevards, and the long rows\n",
      "of black elms, not a passer-by for perhaps a quarter of a league\n",
      "around, the Gorbeau hovel, at its highest pitch of silence, of horror,\n",
      "and of darkness; in that building, in the midst of those solitudes, in\n",
      "the midst of that darkness, the vast Jondrette garret lighted by a\n",
      "single candle, and in that den two men seated at a table, M. Leblanc\n",
      "tranquil, Jondrette smiling and alarming, the Jondrette woman, the\n",
      "female wolf, in one corner, and, behind the partition, Marius,\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Ah! we have had a happy life together, this poor darling and I! What\n",
      "would there be left for us if we had not that? We are so wretched, my\n",
      "respectable sir! We have arms, but there is no work! We have the will,\n",
      "no work! I don’t know how the government arranges that, but, on my word\n",
      "of honor, sir, I am not Jacobin, sir, I am not a bousingot.30 I don’t\n",
      "wish them any evil, but if I were the ministers, on my most sacred\n",
      "word, things would be different. Here, for instance, I wanted to have\n",
      "my girls taught the trade of paper-box makers. You will say to me:\n",
      "‘What! a trade?’ Yes! A trade! A simple trade! A bread-winner! What a\n",

      "willing to part with, for I must live! Item, one must live!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While Jondrette thus talked, with an apparent incoherence which\n",
      "detracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his\n",
      "physiognomy, Marius raised his eyes, and perceived at the other end of\n",
      "the room a person whom he had not seen before. A man had just entered,\n",
      "so softly that the door had not been heard to turn on its hinges. This\n",
      "man wore a violet knitted vest, which was old, worn, spotted, cut and\n",
      "gaping at every fold, wide trousers of cotton velvet, wooden shoes on\n",
      "his feet, no shirt, had his neck bare, his bare arms tattooed, and his\n",
      "face smeared with black. He had seated himself in silence on the\n",
      "nearest bed, and, as he was behind Jondrette, he could only be\n",
      "indistinctly seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "That sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze, caused M.\n",
      "Leblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as Marius. He could not\n",
      "refrain from a gesture of surprise which did not escape Jondrette.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! I see!” exclaimed Jondrette, buttoning up his coat with an air of\n",
      "complaisance, “you are looking at your overcoat? It fits me! My faith,\n",
      "but it fits me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is that man?” said M. Leblanc.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Him?” ejaculated Jondrette, “he’s a neighbor of mine. Don’t pay any\n",
      "attention to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The neighbor was a singular-looking individual. However, manufactories\n",
      "of chemical products abound in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Many of the\n",
      "workmen might have black faces. Besides this, M. Leblanc’s whole person\n",
      "was expressive of candid and intrepid confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me; what were you saying, M. Fabantou?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was telling you, sir, and dear protector,” replied Jondrette placing\n",
      "his elbows on the table and contemplating M. Leblanc with steady and\n",
      "tender eyes, not unlike the eyes of the boa-constrictor, “I was telling\n",
      "you, that I have a picture to sell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A slight sound came from the door. A second man had just entered and\n",
      "seated himself on the bed, behind Jondrette.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the first, his arms were bare, and he had a mask of ink or\n",
      "lampblack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this man had, literally, glided into the room, he had not been\n",
      "able to prevent M. Leblanc catching sight of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t mind them,” said Jondrette, “they are people who belong in the\n",
      "house. So I was saying, that there remains in my possession a valuable\n",
      "picture. But stop, sir, take a look at it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He rose, went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we\n",
      "have already mentioned, and turned it round, still leaving it supported\n",
      "against the wall. It really was something which resembled a picture,\n",
      "and which the candle illuminated, somewhat. Marius could make nothing\n",
      "out of it, as Jondrette stood between the picture and him; he only saw\n",
      "a coarse daub, and a sort of principal personage colored with the harsh\n",
      "crudity of foreign canvasses and screen paintings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that?” asked M. Leblanc.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“A painting by a master, a picture of great value, my benefactor! I am\n",
      "as much attached to it as I am to my two daughters; it recalls\n",
      "souvenirs to me! But I have told you, and I will not take it back, that\n",
      "I am so wretched that I will part with it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Either by chance, or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness,\n",
      "M. Leblanc’s glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examined\n",
      "the picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were now four men, three seated on the bed, one standing near the\n",
      "door-post, all four with bare arms and motionless, with faces smeared\n",
      "with black. One of those on the bed was leaning against the wall, with\n",
      "closed eyes, and it might have been supposed that he was asleep. He was\n",
      "old; his white hair contrasting with his blackened face produced a\n",
      "horrible effect. The other two seemed to be young; one wore a beard,\n",
      "the other wore his hair long. None of them had on shoes; those who did\n",
      "not wear socks were barefooted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jondrette noticed that M. Leblanc’s eye was fixed on these men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are friends. They are neighbors,” said he. “Their faces are black\n",
      "because they work in charcoal. They are chimney-builders. Don’t trouble\n",
      "yourself about them, my benefactor, but buy my picture. Have pity on my\n",
      "misery. I will not ask you much for it. How much do you think it is\n",
      "worth?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said M. Leblanc, looking Jondrette full in the eye, and with\n",
      "the manner of a man who is on his guard, “it is some signboard for a\n",
      "tavern, and is worth about three francs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jondrette replied sweetly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you your pocket-book with you? I should be satisfied with a\n",
      "thousand crowns.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Leblanc sprang up, placed his back against the wall, and cast a\n",
      "rapid glance around the room. He had Jondrette on his left, on the side\n",
      "next the window, and the Jondrette woman and the four men on his right,\n",
      "on the side next the door. The four men did not stir, and did not even\n",
      "seem to be looking on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive tone, with so vague\n",
      "an eye, and so lamentable an intonation, that M. Leblanc might have\n",
      "supposed that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad\n",
      "with misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you do not buy my picture, my dear benefactor,” said Jondrette, “I\n",
      "shall be left without resources; there will be nothing left for me but\n",
      "to throw myself into the river. When I think that I wanted to have my\n",
      "two girls taught the middle-class paper-box trade, the making of boxes\n",
      "for New Year’s gifts! Well! A table with a board at the end to keep the\n",
      "glasses from falling off is required, then a special stove is needed, a\n",
      "pot with three compartments for the different degrees of strength of\n",
      "the paste, according as it is to be used for wood, paper, or stuff, a\n",
      "paring-knife to cut the cardboard, a mould to adjust it, a hammer to\n",
      "nail the steels, pincers, how the devil do I know what all? And all\n",
      "that in order to earn four sous a day! And you have to work fourteen\n",
      "hours a day! And each box passes through the workwoman’s hands thirteen\n",
      "times! And you can’t wet the paper! And you mustn’t spot anything! And\n",
      "you must keep the paste hot. The devil, I tell you! Four sous a day!\n",
      "How do you suppose a man is to live?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke, Jondrette did not look at M. Leblanc, who was observing\n",
      "him. M. Leblanc’s eye was fixed on Jondrette, and Jondrette’s eye was\n",
      "fixed on the door. Marius’ eager attention was transferred from one to\n",
      "the other. M. Leblanc seemed to be asking himself: “Is this man an\n",
      "idiot?” Jondrette repeated two or three distinct times, with all manner\n",
      "of varying inflections of the whining and supplicating order: “There is\n",
      "nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river! I went down\n",

      "that purpose.”\n",

      "The door of the garret had just opened abruptly, and allowed a view of\n",
      "three men clad in blue linen blouses, and masked with masks of black\n",
      "paper. The first was thin, and had a long, iron-tipped cudgel; the\n",
      "second, who was a sort of colossus, carried, by the middle of the\n",
      "handle, with the blade downward, a butcher’s pole-axe for slaughtering\n",
      "cattle. The third, a man with thick-set shoulders, not so slender as\n",
      "the first, held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of\n",
      "some prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared that the arrival of these men was what Jondrette had been\n",
      "waiting for. A rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the\n",
      "cudgel, the thin one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is everything ready?” said Jondrette.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” replied the thin man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is Montparnasse?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The young principal actor stopped to chat with your girl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good,” said Jondrette.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Leblanc was very pale. He was scrutinizing everything around him in\n",
      "the den, like a man who understands what he has fallen into, and his\n",
      "head, directed in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him, moved\n",
      "on his neck with an astonished and attentive slowness, but there was\n",
      "nothing in his air which resembled fear. He had improvised an\n",
      "intrenchment out of the table; and the man, who but an instant\n",
      "previously, had borne merely the appearance of a kindly old man, had\n",
      "suddenly become a sort of athlete, and placed his robust fist on the\n",
      "back of his chair, with a formidable and surprising gesture.\n",
      "\n",
      "This old man, who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such a\n",
      "danger, seemed to possess one of those natures which are as courageous\n",
      "as they are kind, both easily and simply. The father of a woman whom we\n",
      "love is never a stranger to us. Marius felt proud of that unknown man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three of the men, of whom Jondrette had said: “They are\n",
      "chimney-builders,” had armed themselves from the pile of old iron, one\n",
      "with a heavy pair of shears, the second with weighing-tongs, the third\n",
      "with a hammer, and had placed themselves across the entrance without\n",
      "uttering a syllable. The old man had remained on the bed, and had\n",
      "merely opened his eyes. The Jondrette woman had seated herself beside\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for intervention\n",
      "would arrive, and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling, in the\n",
      "direction of the corridor, in readiness to discharge his pistol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel,\n",
      "turned once more to M. Leblanc, and repeated his question, accompanying\n",
      "it with that low, repressed, and terrible laugh which was peculiar to\n",
      "him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you do not recognize me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Leblanc looked him full in the face, and replied:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Jondrette advanced to the table. He leaned across the candle,\n",
      "crossing his arms, putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to M.\n",
      "Leblanc’s calm face, and advancing as far as possible without forcing\n",
      "M. Leblanc to retreat, and, in this posture of a wild beast who is\n",
      "about to bite, he exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“My name is not Fabantou, my name is not Jondrette, my name is\n",
      "Thénardier. I am the inn-keeper of Montfermeil! Do you understand?\n",
      "Thénardier! Now do you know me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "An almost imperceptible flush crossed M. Leblanc’s brow, and he replied\n",
      "with a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level,\n",
      "with his accustomed placidity:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“No more than before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius did not hear this reply. Any one who had seen him at that moment\n",
      "through the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard, stupid,\n",
      "thunder-struck. At the moment when Jondrette said: “My name is\n",
      "Thénardier,” Marius had trembled in every limb, and had leaned against\n",
      "the wall, as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his\n",
      "heart. Then his right arm, all ready to discharge the signal shot,\n",
      "dropped slowly, and at the moment when Jondrette repeated, “Thénardier,\n",
      "do you understand?” Marius’s faltering fingers had come near letting\n",
      "the pistol fall. Jondrette, by revealing his identity, had not moved M.\n",
      "Leblanc, but he had quite upset Marius. That name of Thénardier, with\n",
      "which M. Leblanc did not seem to be acquainted, Marius knew well. Let\n",
      "the reader recall what that name meant to him! That name he had worn on\n",
      "his heart, inscribed in his father’s testament! He bore it at the\n",
      "bottom of his mind, in the depths of his memory, in that sacred\n",
      "injunction: “A certain Thénardier saved my life. If my son encounters\n",
      "him, he will do him all the good that lies in his power.” That name, it\n",
      "will be remembered, was one of the pieties of his soul; he mingled it\n",
      "with the name of his father in his worship. What! This man was that\n",
      "Thénardier, that inn-keeper of Montfermeil whom he had so long and so\n",
      "vainly sought! He had found him at last, and how? His father’s saviour\n",
      "was a ruffian! That man, to whose service Marius was burning to devote\n",
      "himself, was a monster! That liberator of Colonel Pontmercy was on the\n",
      "point of committing a crime whose scope Marius did not, as yet, clearly\n",
      "comprehend, but which resembled an assassination! And against whom,\n",
      "great God! what a fatality! What a bitter mockery of fate! His father\n",
      "had commanded him from the depths of his coffin to do all the good in\n",
      "his power to this Thénardier, and for four years Marius had cherished\n",
      "no other thought than to acquit this debt of his father’s, and at the\n",
      "moment when he was on the eve of having a brigand seized in the very\n",
      "act of crime by justice, destiny cried to him: “This is Thénardier!” He\n",
      "could at last repay this man for his father’s life, saved amid a\n",
      "hail-storm of grape-shot on the heroic field of Waterloo, and repay it\n",
      "with the scaffold! He had sworn to himself that if ever he found that\n",
      "Thénardier, he would address him only by throwing himself at his feet;\n",
      "and now he actually had found him, but it was only to deliver him over\n",
      "to the executioner! His father said to him: “Succor Thénardier!” And he\n",
      "replied to that adored and sainted voice by crushing Thénardier! He was\n",
      "about to offer to his father in his grave the spectacle of that man who\n",
      "had torn him from death at the peril of his own life, executed on the\n",
      "Place Saint-Jacques through the means of his son, of that Marius to\n",
      "whom he had entrusted that man by his will! And what a mockery to have\n",
      "so long worn on his breast his father’s last commands, written in his\n",
      "own hand, only to act in so horribly contrary a sense! But, on the\n",
      "other hand, now look on that trap and not prevent it! Condemn the\n",
      "victim and to spare the assassin! Could one be held to any gratitude\n",
      "towards so miserable a wretch? All the ideas which Marius had cherished\n",
      "for the last four years were pierced through and through, as it were,\n",
      "by this unforeseen blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shuddered. Everything depended on him. Unknown to themselves, he\n",
      "held in his hand all those beings who were moving about there before\n",
      "his eyes. If he fired his pistol, M. Leblanc was saved, and Thénardier\n",
      "lost; if he did not fire, M. Leblanc would be sacrificed, and, who\n",
      "knows? Thénardier would escape. Should he dash down the one or allow\n",
      "the other to fall? Remorse awaited him in either case.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was he to do? What should he choose? Be false to the most\n",
      "imperious souvenirs, to all those solemn vows to himself, to the most\n",
      "sacred duty, to the most venerated text! Should he ignore his father’s\n",
      "testament, or allow the perpetration of a crime! On the one hand, it\n",
      "seemed to him that he heard “his Ursule” supplicating for her father\n",
      "and on the other, the colonel commending Thénardier to his care. He\n",
      "felt that he was going mad. His knees gave way beneath him. And he had\n",
      "not even the time for deliberation, so great was the fury with which\n",
      "the scene before his eyes was hastening to its catastrophe. It was like\n",
      "a whirlwind of which he had thought himself the master, and which was\n",
      "now sweeping him away. He was on the verge of swooning.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, Thénardier, whom we shall henceforth call by no other\n",
      "name, was pacing up and down in front of the table in a sort of frenzy\n",
      "and wild triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seized the candle in his fist, and set it on the chimney-piece with\n",
      "so violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished, and the\n",
      "tallow bespattered the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turned to M. Leblanc with a horrible look, and spit out these\n",
      "words:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Done for! Smoked brown! Cooked! Spitchcocked!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And again he began to march back and forth, in full eruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” he cried, “so I’ve found you again at last, Mister\n",
      "philanthropist! Mister threadbare millionnaire! Mister giver of dolls!\n",
      "you old ninny! Ah! so you don’t recognize me! No, it wasn’t you who\n",
      "came to Montfermeil, to my inn, eight years ago, on Christmas eve,\n",
      "1823! It wasn’t you who carried off that Fantine’s child from me! The\n",
      "Lark! It wasn’t you who had a yellow great-coat! No! Nor a package of\n",
      "duds in your hand, as you had this morning here! Say, wife, it seems to\n",
      "be his mania to carry packets of woollen stockings into houses! Old\n",
      "charity monger, get out with you! Are you a hosier, Mister\n",
      "millionnaire? You give away your stock in trade to the poor, holy man!\n",
      "What bosh! merry Andrew! Ah! and you don’t recognize me? Well, I\n",
      "recognize you, that I do! I recognized you the very moment you poked\n",
      "your snout in here. Ah! you’ll find out presently, that it isn’t all\n",
      "roses to thrust yourself in that fashion into people’s houses, under\n",
      "the pretext that they are taverns, in wretched clothes, with the air of\n",
      "a poor man, to whom one would give a sou, to deceive persons, to play\n",
      "the generous, to take away their means of livelihood, and to make\n",
      "threats in the woods, and you can’t call things quits because\n",
      "afterwards, when people are ruined, you bring a coat that is too large,\n",
      "and two miserable hospital blankets, you old blackguard, you\n",
      "child-stealer!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment. One would\n",
      "have said that his wrath had fallen into some hole, like the Rhone;\n",
      "then, as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been\n",
      "saying to himself in a whisper, he smote the table with his fist, and\n",
      "shouted:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“And with his goody-goody air!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And, apostrophizing M. Leblanc:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Parbleu! You made game of me in the past! You are the cause of all my\n",
      "misfortunes! For fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom I had, and\n",
      "who certainly belonged to rich people, and who had already brought in a\n",
      "great deal of money, and from whom I might have extracted enough to\n",
      "live on all my life! A girl who would have made up to me for everything\n",
      "that I lost in that vile cook-shop, where there was nothing but one\n",
      "continual row, and where, like a fool, I ate up my last farthing! Oh! I\n",
      "wish all the wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who\n",
      "drank it! Well, never mind! Say, now! You must have thought me\n",
      "ridiculous when you went off with the Lark! You had your cudgel in the\n",
      "forest. You were the stronger. Revenge. I’m the one to hold the trumps\n",
      "to-day! You’re in a sorry case, my good fellow! Oh, but I can laugh!\n",
      "Really, I laugh! Didn’t he fall into the trap! I told him that I was an\n",
      "actor, that my name was Fabantou, that I had played comedy with\n",
      "Mamselle Mars, with Mamselle Muche, that my landlord insisted on being\n",
      "paid tomorrow, the 4th of February, and he didn’t even notice that the\n",
      "8th of January, and not the 4th of February is the time when the\n",
      "quarter runs out! Absurd idiot! And the four miserable Philippes which\n",
      "he has brought me! Scoundrel! He hadn’t the heart even to go as high as\n",
      "a hundred francs! And how he swallowed my platitudes! That did amuse\n",
      "me. I said to myself: ‘Blockhead! Come, I’ve got you! I lick your paws\n",
      "this morning, but I’ll gnaw your heart this evening!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier paused. He was out of breath. His little, narrow chest\n",
      "panted like a forge bellows. His eyes were full of the ignoble\n",
      "happiness of a feeble, cruel, and cowardly creature, which finds that\n",
      "it can, at last, harass what it has feared, and insult what it has\n",
      "flattered, the joy of a dwarf who should be able to set his heel on the\n",
      "head of Goliath, the joy of a jackal which is beginning to rend a sick\n",
      "bull, so nearly dead that he can no longer defend himself, but\n",
      "sufficiently alive to suffer still.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Leblanc did not interrupt him, but said to him when he paused:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know what you mean to say. You are mistaken in me. I am a\n",
      "very poor man, and anything but a millionnaire. I do not know you. You\n",
      "are mistaking me for some other person.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” roared Thénardier hoarsely, “a pretty lie! You stick to that\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Who has not remarked the fact that odious creatures possess a\n",

      "grasped his chair as though he were about to crush it in his hands.\n",

      "“Villain! Yes, I know that you call us that, you rich gentlemen! Stop!\n",
      "it’s true that I became bankrupt, that I am in hiding, that I have no\n",
      "bread, that I have not a single sou, that I am a villain! It’s three\n",
      "days since I have had anything to eat, so I’m a villain! Ah! you folks\n",
      "warm your feet, you have Sakoski boots, you have wadded great-coats,\n",
      "like archbishops, you lodge on the first floor in houses that have\n",
      "porters, you eat truffles, you eat asparagus at forty francs the bunch\n",
      "in the month of January, and green peas, you gorge yourselves, and when\n",
      "you want to know whether it is cold, you look in the papers to see what\n",
      "the engineer Chevalier’s thermometer says about it. We, it is we who\n",
      "are thermometers. We don’t need to go out and look on the quay at the\n",
      "corner of the Tour de l’Horologe, to find out the number of degrees of\n",
      "cold; we feel our blood congealing in our veins, and the ice forming\n",
      "round our hearts, and we say: ‘There is no God!’ And you come to our\n",

      "I ought to have been decorated! I was at Waterloo, so I was! And in the\n",
      "battle I saved a general called the Comte of I don’t know what. He told\n",

      "I caught was Merci [thanks]. I’d rather have had his name than his\n",
      "thanks. That would have helped me to find him again. The picture that\n",
      "you see here, and which was painted by David at Bruqueselles,—do you\n",
      "know what it represents? It represents me. David wished to immortalize\n",
      "that feat of prowess. I have that general on my back, and I am carrying\n",

      "all the furies! And now that I have had the goodness to tell you all\n",
      "this, let’s have an end of it. I want money, I want a deal of money, I\n",

      "Marius had regained some measure of control over his anguish, and was\n",

      "As he had ceased to intercept Marius’ visual ray, Marius could examine\n",
      "this thing, and in the daub, he actually did recognize a battle, a\n",
      "background of smoke, and a man carrying another man. It was the group\n",
      "composed of Pontmercy and Thénardier; the sergeant the rescuer, the\n",
      "colonel rescued. Marius was like a drunken man; this picture restored\n",
      "his father to life in some sort; it was no longer the signboard of the\n",
      "wine-shop at Montfermeil, it was a resurrection; a tomb had yawned, a\n",
      "phantom had risen there. Marius heard his heart beating in his temples,\n",
      "he had the cannon of Waterloo in his ears, his bleeding father, vaguely\n",
      "depicted on that sinister panel terrified him, and it seemed to him\n",
      "that the misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Thénardier had recovered his breath, he turned his bloodshot eyes\n",
      "on M. Leblanc, and said to him in a low, curt voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Leblanc held his peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of this silence, a cracked voice launched this lugubrious\n",
      "sarcasm from the corridor:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“If there’s any wood to be split, I’m there!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the man with the axe, who was growing merry.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same moment, an enormous, bristling, and clayey face made its\n",
      "appearance at the door, with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth,\n",
      "but fangs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the face of the man with the butcher’s axe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why have you taken off your mask?” cried Thénardier in a rage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For fun,” retorted the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the last few minutes M. Leblanc had appeared to be watching and\n",
      "following all the movements of Thénardier, who, blinded and dazzled by\n",
      "his own rage, was stalking to and fro in the den with full confidence\n",
      "that the door was guarded, and of holding an unarmed man fast, he being\n",
      "armed himself, of being nine against one, supposing that the female\n",
      "Thénardier counted for but one man.\n",
      "\n",
      "During his address to the man with the pole-axe, he had turned his back\n",
      "to M. Leblanc.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Leblanc seized this moment, overturned the chair with his foot and\n",
      "the table with his fist, and with one bound, with prodigious agility,\n",
      "before Thénardier had time to turn round, he had reached the window. To\n",
      "open it, to scale the frame, to bestride it, was the work of a second\n",
      "only. He was half out when six robust fists seized him and dragged him\n",
      "back energetically into the hovel. These were the three\n",
      "“chimney-builders,” who had flung themselves upon him. At the same time\n",
      "the Thénardier woman had wound her hands in his hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the trampling which ensued, the other ruffians rushed up from the\n",
      "corridor. The old man on the bed, who seemed under the influence of\n",
      "wine, descended from the pallet and came reeling up, with a\n",
      "stone-breaker’s hammer in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the “chimney-builders,” whose smirched face was lighted up by\n",
      "the candle, and in whom Marius recognized, in spite of his daubing,\n",
      "Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, lifted above M.\n",
      "Leblanc’s head a sort of bludgeon made of two balls of lead, at the two\n",
      "ends of a bar of iron.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius could not resist this sight. “My father,” he thought, “forgive\n",
      "me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And his finger sought the trigger of his pistol.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shot was on the point of being discharged when Thénardier’s voice\n",
      "shouted:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t harm him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This desperate attempt of the victim, far from exasperating Thénardier,\n",
      "had calmed him. There existed in him two men, the ferocious man and the\n",
      "adroit man. Up to that moment, in the excess of his triumph in the\n",
      "presence of the prey which had been brought down, and which did not\n",
      "stir, the ferocious man had prevailed; when the victim struggled and\n",
      "tried to resist, the adroit man reappeared and took the upper hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t hurt him!” he repeated, and without suspecting it, his first\n",
      "success was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged, and to\n",
      "paralyze Marius, in whose opinion the urgency of the case disappeared,\n",
      "and who, in the face of this new phase, saw no inconvenience in waiting\n",
      "a while longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who knows whether some chance would not arise which would deliver him\n",
      "from the horrible alternative of allowing Ursule’s father to perish, or\n",
      "of destroying the colonel’s saviour?\n",
      "\n",
      "A herculean struggle had begun. With one blow full in the chest, M.\n",
      "Leblanc had sent the old man tumbling, rolling in the middle of the\n",
      "room, then with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown two\n",
      "more assailants, and he held one under each of his knees; the wretches\n",
      "were rattling in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granite\n",
      "millstone; but the other four had seized the formidable old man by both\n",
      "arms and the back of his neck, and were holding him doubled up over the\n",
      "two “chimney-builders” on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the master of some and mastered by the rest, crushing those\n",
      "beneath him and stifling under those on top of him, endeavoring in vain\n",
      "to shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him, M. Leblanc\n",
      "disappeared under the horrible group of ruffians like the wild boar\n",
      "beneath a howling pile of dogs and hounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "They succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the window, and\n",
      "there they held him in awe. The Thénardier woman had not released her\n",
      "clutch on his hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you mix yourself up in this affair,” said Thénardier. “You’ll\n",
      "tear your shawl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Thénardier obeyed, as the female wolf obeys the male wolf, with a\n",
      "growl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said Thénardier, “search him, you other fellows!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "They searched him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing six\n",
      "francs, and his handkerchief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! No pocket-book?” he demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, nor watch,” replied one of the “chimney-builders.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind,” murmured the masked man who carried the big key, in the\n",
      "voice of a ventriloquist, “he’s a tough old fellow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier went to the corner near the door, picked up a bundle of\n",
      "ropes and threw them at the men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tie him to the leg of the bed,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across the\n",
      "room by the blow from M. Leblanc’s fist, and who made no movement, he\n",
      "added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Boulatruelle dead?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” replied Bigrenaille, “he’s drunk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sweep him into a corner,” said Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two of the “chimney-builders” pushed the drunken man into the corner\n",
      "near the heap of old iron with their feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Babet,” said Thénardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel, “why\n",
      "did you bring so many; they were not needed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What can you do?” replied the man with the cudgel, “they all wanted to\n",
      "be in it. This is a bad season. There’s no business going on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The pallet on which M. Leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospital\n",
      "bed, elevated on four coarse wooden legs, roughly hewn.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Leblanc let them take their own course.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ruffians bound him securely, in an upright attitude, with his feet\n",
      "on the ground at the head of the bed, the end which was most remote\n",
      "from the window, and nearest to the fireplace.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the last knot had been tied, Thénardier took a chair and seated\n",
      "himself almost facing M. Leblanc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier no longer looked like himself; in the course of a few\n",
      "moments his face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil and\n",
      "cunning sweetness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile of a man\n",
      "in official life the almost bestial mouth which had been foaming but a\n",
      "moment before; he gazed with amazement on that fantastic and alarming\n",
      "metamorphosis, and he felt as a man might feel who should behold a\n",
      "tiger converted into a lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur—” said Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "And dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept their hands\n",
      "on M. Leblanc:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stand off a little, and let me have a talk with the gentleman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All retired towards the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur, you did wrong to try to jump out of the window. You might\n",
      "have broken your leg. Now, if you will permit me, we will converse\n",
      "quietly. In the first place, I must communicate to you an observation\n",
      "which I have made which is, that you have not uttered the faintest\n",
      "cry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier was right, this detail was correct, although it had escaped\n",
      "Marius in his agitation. M. Leblanc had barely pronounced a few words,\n",
      "without raising his voice, and even during his struggle with the six\n",
      "ruffians near the window he had preserved the most profound and\n",
      "singular silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier continued:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mon Dieu! You might have shouted ‘stop thief’ a bit, and I should not\n",
      "have thought it improper. ‘Murder!’ That, too, is said occasionally,\n",
      "and, so far as I am concerned, I should not have taken it in bad part.\n",
      "It is very natural that you should make a little row when you find\n",
      "yourself with persons who don’t inspire you with sufficient confidence.\n",
      "You might have done that, and no one would have troubled you on that\n",
      "account. You would not even have been gagged. And I will tell you why.\n",
      "This room is very private. That’s its only recommendation, but it has\n",
      "that in its favor. You might fire off a mortar and it would produce\n",
      "about as much noise at the nearest police station as the snores of a\n",
      "drunken man. Here a cannon would make a _boum_, and the thunder would\n",
      "make a _pouf_. It’s a handy lodging. But, in short, you did not shout,\n",
      "and it is better so. I present you my compliments, and I will tell you\n",
      "the conclusion that I draw from that fact: My dear sir, when a man\n",
      "shouts, who comes? The police. And after the police? Justice. Well! You\n",
      "have not made an outcry; that is because you don’t care to have the\n",
      "police and the courts come in any more than we do. It is because,—I\n",
      "have long suspected it,—you have some interest in hiding something. On\n",
      "our side we have the same interest. So we can come to an\n",
      "understanding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke thus, it seemed as though Thénardier, who kept his eyes\n",
      "fixed on M. Leblanc, were trying to plunge the sharp points which\n",
      "darted from the pupils into the very conscience of his prisoner.\n",
      "Moreover, his language, which was stamped with a sort of moderated,\n",
      "subdued insolence and crafty insolence, was reserved and almost choice,\n",
      "and in that rascal, who had been nothing but a robber a short time\n",
      "previously, one now felt “the man who had studied for the priesthood.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The silence preserved by the prisoner, that precaution which had been\n",
      "carried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life, that\n",
      "resistance opposed to the first impulse of nature, which is to utter a\n",
      "cry, all this, it must be confessed, now that his attention had been\n",
      "called to it, troubled Marius, and affected him with painful\n",
      "astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier’s well-grounded observation still further obscured for\n",
      "Marius the dense mystery which enveloped that grave and singular person\n",
      "on whom Courfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of Monsieur Leblanc.\n",
      "\n",
      "But whoever he was, bound with ropes, surrounded with executioners,\n",
      "half plunged, so to speak, in a grave which was closing in upon him to\n",
      "the extent of a degree with every moment that passed, in the presence\n",
      "of Thénardier’s wrath, as in the presence of his sweetness, this man\n",
      "remained impassive; and Marius could not refrain from admiring at such\n",
      "a moment the superbly melancholy visage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, evidently, was a soul which was inaccessible to terror, and which\n",
      "did not know the meaning of despair. Here was one of those men who\n",
      "command amazement in desperate circumstances. Extreme as was the\n",
      "crisis, inevitable as was the catastrophe, there was nothing here of\n",
      "the agony of the drowning man, who opens his horror-filled eyes under\n",
      "the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier rose in an unpretending manner, went to the fireplace,\n",
      "shoved aside the screen, which he leaned against the neighboring\n",
      "pallet, and thus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals, in which\n",
      "the prisoner could plainly see the chisel white-hot and spotted here\n",
      "and there with tiny scarlet stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Thénardier returned to his seat beside M. Leblanc.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I continue,” said he. “We can come to an understanding. Let us arrange\n",
      "this matter in an amicable way. I was wrong to lose my temper just now,\n",
      "I don’t know what I was thinking of, I went a great deal too far, I\n",
      "said extravagant things. For example, because you are a millionnaire, I\n",
      "told you that I exacted money, a lot of money, a deal of money. That\n",
      "would not be reasonable. Mon Dieu, in spite of your riches, you have\n",
      "expenses of your own—who has not? I don’t want to ruin you, I am not a\n",
      "greedy fellow, after all. I am not one of those people who, because\n",
      "they have the advantage of the position, profit by the fact to make\n",
      "themselves ridiculous. Why, I’m taking things into consideration and\n",
      "making a sacrifice on my side. I only want two hundred thousand\n",
      "francs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Leblanc uttered not a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see that I put not a little water in my wine; I’m very moderate. I\n",
      "don’t know the state of your fortune, but I do know that you don’t\n",
      "stick at money, and a benevolent man like yourself can certainly give\n",
      "two hundred thousand francs to the father of a family who is out of\n",
      "luck. Certainly, you are reasonable, too; you haven’t imagined that I\n",
      "should take all the trouble I have to-day and organized this affair\n",
      "this evening, which has been labor well bestowed, in the opinion of\n",
      "these gentlemen, merely to wind up by asking you for enough to go and\n",
      "drink red wine at fifteen sous and eat veal at Desnoyer’s. Two hundred\n",
      "thousand francs—it’s surely worth all that. This trifle once out of\n",
      "your pocket, I guarantee you that that’s the end of the matter, and\n",
      "that you have no further demands to fear. You will say to me: ‘But I\n",
      "haven’t two hundred thousand francs about me.’ Oh! I’m not\n",
      "extortionate. I don’t demand that. I only ask one thing of you. Have\n",
      "the goodness to write what I am about to dictate to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Thénardier paused; then he added, emphasizing his words, and\n",
      "casting a smile in the direction of the brazier:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I warn you that I shall not admit that you don’t know how to write.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A grand inquisitor might have envied that smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier pushed the table close to M. Leblanc, and took an inkstand,\n",
      "a pen, and a sheet of paper from the drawer which he left half open,\n",
      "and in which gleamed the long blade of the knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "He placed the sheet of paper before M. Leblanc.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Write,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoner spoke at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you expect me to write? I am bound.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s true, excuse me!” ejaculated Thénardier, “you are quite right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And turning to Bigrenaille:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Untie the gentleman’s right arm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, executed Thénardier’s\n",
      "order.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the prisoner’s right arm was free, Thénardier dipped the pen in\n",
      "the ink and presented it to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Understand thoroughly, sir, that you are in our power, at our\n",
      "discretion, that no human power can get you out of this, and that we\n",
      "shall be really grieved if we are forced to proceed to disagreeable\n",
      "extremities. I know neither your name, nor your address, but I warn\n",
      "you, that you will remain bound until the person charged with carrying\n",
      "the letter which you are about to write shall have returned. Now, be so\n",
      "good as to write.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What?” demanded the prisoner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will dictate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Leblanc took the pen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier began to dictate:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“My daughter—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoner shuddered, and raised his eyes to Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Put down ‘My dear daughter’—” said Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Leblanc obeyed.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Come instantly—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You address her as _thou_, do you not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who?” asked M. Leblanc.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Parbleu!” cried Thénardier, “the little one, the Lark.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know what you mean.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on, nevertheless,” ejaculated Thénardier, and he continued to\n",
      "dictate:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come immediately, I am in absolute need of thee. The person who will\n",
      "deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me. I am\n",
      "waiting for thee. Come with confidence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Leblanc had written the whole of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier resumed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! erase ‘come with confidence’; that might lead her to suppose that\n",
      "everything was not as it should be, and that distrust is possible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Leblanc erased the three words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” pursued Thénardier, “sign it. What’s your name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoner laid down the pen and demanded:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“For whom is this letter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know well,” retorted Thénardier, “for the little one I just told\n",
      "you so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was evident that Thénardier avoided naming the young girl in\n",
      "question. He said “the Lark,” he said “the little one,” but he did not\n",
      "pronounce her name—the precaution of a clever man guarding his secret\n",
      "from his accomplices. To mention the name was to deliver the whole\n",
      "“affair” into their hands, and to tell them more about it than there\n",
      "was any need of their knowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sign. What is your name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Urbain Fabre,” said the prisoner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier, with the movement of a cat, dashed his hand into his pocket\n",
      "and drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on M. Leblanc. He\n",
      "looked for the mark on it, and held it close to the candle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“U. F. That’s it. Urbain Fabre. Well, sign it U. F.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoner signed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As two hands are required to fold the letter, give it to me, I will\n",
      "fold it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That done, Thénardier resumed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Address it, ‘Mademoiselle Fabre,’ at your house. I know that you live\n",
      "a long distance from here, near Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, because you\n",
      "go to mass there every day, but I don’t know in what street. I see that\n",
      "you understand your situation. As you have not lied about your name,\n",
      "you will not lie about your address. Write it yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment, then he took the pen and\n",
      "wrote:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mademoiselle Fabre, at M. Urbain Fabre’s, Rue Saint-Dominique-D’Enfer,\n",
      "No. 17.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wife!” he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Thénardier woman hastened to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here’s the letter. You know what you have to do. There is a carriage\n",
      "at the door. Set out at once, and return ditto.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And addressing the man with the meat-axe:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Since you have taken off your nose-screen, accompany the mistress. You\n",
      "will get up behind the fiacre. You know where you left the team?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "And depositing his axe in a corner, he followed Madame Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they set off, Thénardier thrust his head through the half-open door,\n",
      "and shouted into the corridor:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Above all things, don’t lose the letter! remember that you carry two\n",
      "hundred thousand francs with you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Thénardier’s hoarse voice replied:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be easy. I have it in my bosom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A minute had not elapsed, when the sound of the cracking of a whip was\n",
      "heard, which rapidly retreated and died away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good!” growled Thénardier. “They’re going at a fine pace. At such a\n",
      "gallop, the bourgeoise will be back inside three-quarters of an hour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew a chair close to the fireplace, folding his arms, and\n",
      "presenting his muddy boots to the brazier.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My feet are cold!” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only five ruffians now remained in the den with Thénardier and the\n",
      "prisoner.\n",
      "\n",
      "These men, through the black masks or paste which covered their faces,\n",
      "and made of them, at fear’s pleasure, charcoal-burners, negroes, or\n",
      "demons, had a stupid and gloomy air, and it could be felt that they\n",
      "perpetrated a crime like a bit of work, tranquilly, without either\n",
      "wrath or mercy, with a sort of ennui. They were crowded together in one\n",
      "corner like brutes, and remained silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier warmed his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoner had relapsed into his taciturnity. A sombre calm had\n",
      "succeeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a few\n",
      "moments before.\n",
      "\n",
      "The candle, on which a large “stranger” had formed, cast but a dim\n",
      "light in the immense hovel, the brazier had grown dull, and all those\n",
      "monstrous heads cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man,\n",
      "who was fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle.\n",
      "The enigma was more impenetrable than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who was this “little one” whom Thénardier had called the Lark? Was she\n",
      "his “Ursule”? The prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word,\n",
      "“the Lark,” and had replied in the most natural manner in the world: “I\n",
      "do not know what you mean.” On the other hand, the two letters U. F.\n",
      "were explained; they meant Urbain Fabre; and Ursule was no longer named\n",
      "Ursule. This was what Marius perceived most clearly of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post, from which\n",
      "he was observing and commanding this whole scene. There he stood,\n",
      "almost incapable of movement or reflection, as though annihilated by\n",
      "the abominable things viewed at such close quarters. He waited, in the\n",
      "hope of some incident, no matter of what nature, since he could not\n",
      "collect his thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In any case,” he said, “if she is the Lark, I shall see her, for the\n",
      "Thénardier woman is to bring her hither. That will be the end, and then\n",
      "I will give my life and my blood if necessary, but I will deliver her!\n",
      "Nothing shall stop me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly half an hour passed in this manner. Thénardier seemed to be\n",
      "absorbed in gloomy reflections, the prisoner did not stir. Still,\n",
      "Marius fancied that at intervals, and for the last few moments, he had\n",
      "heard a faint, dull noise in the direction of the prisoner.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once, Thénardier addressed the prisoner:\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the way, Monsieur Fabre, I might as well say it to you at once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation. Marius\n",
      "strained his ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My wife will be back shortly, don’t get impatient. I think that the\n",
      "Lark really is your daughter, and it seems to me quite natural that you\n",
      "should keep her. Only, listen to me a bit. My wife will go and hunt her\n",
      "up with your letter. I told my wife to dress herself in the way she\n",
      "did, so that your young lady might make no difficulty about following\n",
      "her. They will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind.\n",
      "Somewhere, outside the barrier, there is a trap harnessed to two very\n",
      "good horses. Your young lady will be taken to it. She will alight from\n",
      "the fiacre. My comrade will enter the other vehicle with her, and my\n",
      "wife will come back here to tell us: ‘It’s done.’ As for the young\n",
      "lady, no harm will be done to her; the trap will conduct her to a place\n",
      "where she will be quiet, and just as soon as you have handed over to me\n",
      "those little two hundred thousand francs, she will be returned to you.\n",
      "If you have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to\n",
      "the Lark, that’s all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoner uttered not a syllable. After a pause, Thénardier\n",
      "continued:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s very simple, as you see. There’ll be no harm done unless you wish\n",
      "that there should be harm done. I’m telling you how things stand. I\n",
      "warn you so that you may be prepared.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused: the prisoner did not break the silence, and Thénardier\n",
      "resumed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“As soon as my wife returns and says to me: ‘The Lark is on the way,’\n",
      "we will release you, and you will be free to go and sleep at home. You\n",
      "see that our intentions are not evil.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Terrible images passed through Marius’ mind. What! That young girl whom\n",
      "they were abducting was not to be brought back? One of those monsters\n",
      "was to bear her off into the darkness? Whither? And what if it were\n",
      "she!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was clear that it was she. Marius felt his heart stop beating.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was he to do? Discharge the pistol? Place all those scoundrels in\n",
      "the hands of justice? But the horrible man with the meat-axe would,\n",
      "nonetheless, be out of reach with the young girl, and Marius reflected\n",
      "on Thénardier’s words, of which he perceived the bloody significance:\n",
      "“If you have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to\n",
      "the Lark.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it was not alone by the colonel’s testament, it was by his own\n",
      "love, it was by the peril of the one he loved, that he felt himself\n",
      "restrained.\n",
      "\n",
      "This frightful situation, which had already lasted above half an hour,\n",
      "was changing its aspect every moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the\n",
      "most heart-breaking conjectures, seeking hope and finding none.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tumult of his thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence of the\n",
      "den.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of this silence, the door at the bottom of the staircase\n",
      "was heard to open and shut again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoner made a movement in his bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here’s the bourgeoise,” said Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had hardly uttered the words, when the Thénardier woman did in fact\n",
      "rush hastily into the room, red, panting, breathless, with flaming\n",
      "eyes, and cried, as she smote her huge hands on her thighs\n",
      "simultaneously:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“False address!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her and\n",
      "picked up his axe again.\n",
      "\n",
      "She resumed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nobody there! Rue Saint-Dominique, No. 17, no Monsieur Urbain Fabre!\n",
      "They know not what it means!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused, choking, then went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur Thénardier! That old fellow has duped you! You are too good,\n",
      "you see! If it had been me, I’d have chopped the beast in four quarters\n",
      "to begin with! And if he had acted ugly, I’d have boiled him alive! He\n",
      "would have been obliged to speak, and say where the girl is, and where\n",
      "he keeps his shiners! That’s the way I should have managed matters!\n",
      "People are perfectly right when they say that men are a deal stupider\n",
      "than women! Nobody at No. 17. It’s nothing but a big carriage gate! No\n",
      "Monsieur Fabre in the Rue Saint-Dominique! And after all that racing\n",
      "and fee to the coachman and all! I spoke to both the porter and the\n",
      "portress, a fine, stout woman, and they know nothing about him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius breathed freely once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "She, Ursule or the Lark, he no longer knew what to call her, was safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "While his exasperated wife vociferated, Thénardier had seated himself\n",
      "on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "For several minutes he uttered not a word, but swung his right foot,\n",
      "which hung down, and stared at the brazier with an air of savage\n",
      "reverie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, he said to the prisoner, with a slow and singularly ferocious\n",
      "tone:\n",
      "\n",
      "“A false address? What did you expect to gain by that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“To gain time!” cried the prisoner in a thundering voice, and at the\n",
      "same instant he shook off his bonds; they were cut. The prisoner was\n",
      "only attached to the bed now by one leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward,\n",
      "he had bent down into the fireplace, had stretched out his hand to the\n",
      "brazier, and had then straightened himself up again, and now\n",
      "Thénardier, the female Thénardier, and the ruffians, huddled in\n",
      "amazement at the extremity of the hovel, stared at him in stupefaction,\n",
      "as almost free and in a formidable attitude, he brandished above his\n",
      "head the red-hot chisel, which emitted a threatening glow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judicial examination to which the ambush in the Gorbeau house\n",
      "eventually gave rise, established the fact that a large sou piece, cut\n",
      "and worked in a peculiar fashion, was found in the garret, when the\n",
      "police made their descent on it. This sou piece was one of those\n",
      "marvels of industry, which are engendered by the patience of the\n",
      "galleys in the shadows and for the shadows, marvels which are nothing\n",
      "else than instruments of escape. These hideous and delicate products of\n",
      "wonderful art are to jewellers’ work what the metaphors of slang are to\n",
      "poetry. There are Benvenuto Cellinis in the galleys, just as there are\n",
      "Villons in language. The unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance\n",
      "finds means sometimes without tools, sometimes with a common\n",
      "wooden-handled knife, to saw a sou into two thin plates, to hollow out\n",
      "these plates without affecting the coinage stamp, and to make a furrow\n",
      "on the edge of the sou in such a manner that the plates will adhere\n",
      "again. This can be screwed together and unscrewed at will; it is a box.\n",
      "In this box he hides a watch-spring, and this watch-spring, properly\n",
      "handled, cuts good-sized chains and bars of iron. The unfortunate\n",
      "convict is supposed to possess merely a sou; not at all, he possesses\n",
      "liberty. It was a large sou of this sort which, during the subsequent\n",
      "search of the police, was found under the bed near the window. They\n",
      "also found a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the sou.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is probable that the prisoner had this sou piece on his person at\n",
      "the moment when the ruffians searched him, that he contrived to conceal\n",
      "it in his hand, and that afterward, having his right hand free, he\n",
      "unscrewed it, and used it as a saw to cut the cords which fastened him,\n",
      "which would explain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movements\n",
      "which Marius had observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he had not been able to bend down, for fear of betraying himself, he\n",
      "had not cut the bonds of his left leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ruffians had recovered from their first surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be easy,” said Bigrenaille to Thénardier. “He still holds by one leg,\n",
      "and he can’t get away. I’ll answer for that. I tied that paw for him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile, the prisoner had begun to speak:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are wretches, but my life is not worth the trouble of defending\n",
      "it. When you think that you can make me speak, that you can make me\n",
      "write what I do not choose to write, that you can make me say what I do\n",
      "not choose to say—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He stripped up his left sleeve, and added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“See here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same moment he extended his arm, and laid the glowing chisel\n",
      "which he held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crackling of the burning flesh became audible, and the odor\n",
      "peculiar to chambers of torture filled the hovel.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: Red Hot Chisel]\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius reeled in utter horror, the very ruffians shuddered, hardly a\n",
      "muscle of the old man’s face contracted, and while the red-hot iron\n",
      "sank into the smoking wound, impassive and almost august, he fixed on\n",
      "Thénardier his beautiful glance, in which there was no hatred, and\n",
      "where suffering vanished in serene majesty.\n",
      "\n",
      "With grand and lofty natures, the revolts of the flesh and the senses\n",
      "when subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth,\n",
      "and make it appear on the brow, just as rebellions among the soldiery\n",
      "force the captain to show himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wretches!” said he, “have no more fear of me than I have for you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And, tearing the chisel from the wound, he hurled it through the\n",
      "window, which had been left open; the horrible, glowing tool\n",
      "disappeared into the night, whirling as it flew, and fell far away on\n",
      "the snow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoner resumed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do what you please with me.” He was disarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seize him!” said Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder, and the masked\n",
      "man with the ventriloquist’s voice took up his station in front of him,\n",
      "ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, Marius heard below him, at the base of the partition,\n",
      "but so near that he could not see who was speaking, this colloquy\n",
      "conducted in a low tone:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is only one thing left to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cut his throat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the husband and wife taking counsel together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier walked slowly towards the table, opened the drawer, and took\n",
      "out the knife. Marius fretted with the handle of his pistol.\n",
      "Unprecedented perplexity! For the last hour he had had two voices in\n",
      "his conscience, the one enjoining him to respect his father’s\n",
      "testament, the other crying to him to rescue the prisoner. These two\n",
      "voices continued uninterruptedly that struggle which tormented him to\n",
      "agony. Up to that moment he had cherished a vague hope that he should\n",
      "find some means of reconciling these two duties, but nothing within the\n",
      "limits of possibility had presented itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the peril was urgent, the last bounds of delay had been\n",
      "reached; Thénardier was standing thoughtfully a few paces distant from\n",
      "the prisoner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius cast a wild glance about him, the last mechanical resource of\n",
      "despair. All at once a shudder ran through him.\n",
      "\n",
      "At his feet, on the table, a bright ray of light from the full moon\n",
      "illuminated and seemed to point out to him a sheet of paper. On this\n",
      "paper he read the following line written that very morning, in large\n",
      "letters, by the eldest of the Thénardier girls:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“THE BOBBIES ARE HERE.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "An idea, a flash, crossed Marius’ mind; this was the expedient of which\n",
      "he was in search, the solution of that frightful problem which was\n",
      "torturing him, of sparing the assassin and saving the victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knelt down on his commode, stretched out his arm, seized the sheet\n",

      "It was high time. Thénardier had conquered his last fears or his last\n",

      "\n",
      "“Through what?” resumed Bigrenaille.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Through the window,” replied Thénardier. “Since Ponine has thrown the\n",

      "that side.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "three times rapidly without uttering a word.\n",
      "\n",

      "and solidly fastened to the sill by the two iron hooks.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he rushed headlong to the window.\n",

      "begun operations by opening “his pockets,” and dropping into it the two\n",

      "Then Javert had made a point and had bent his ear to waiting for the\n",

      "an attitude of defence, one with his meat-axe, another with his key,\n",
      "another with his bludgeon, the rest with shears, pincers, and hammers.\n",
      "Thénardier had his knife in his fist. The Thénardier woman snatched up\n",

      "a huge piece of plastering, and, rebounding from angle to angle across\n",
      "the hovel, now luckily almost empty, rested at Javert’s feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same moment, Javert reached the Thénardier couple. One of his\n",

      "“Yes,” replied Javert.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Keep on your masks,” said Javert.\n",
      "\n",
      "And passing them in review with a glance of a Frederick II. at a\n",

      "“Untie the gentleman!” said Javert, “and let no one go out!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, he seated himself with sovereign dignity before the table,\n",
      "where the candle and the writing-materials still remained, drew a\n",

      "\n",
      "When he had written the first lines, which are formulas that never\n",

      "The door was guarded, but the window was not. As soon as he had found\n",

      "1831 and 1832, the two years which are immediately connected with the\n",
      "Revolution of July, form one of the most peculiar and striking moments\n",
      "of history. These two years rise like two mountains midway between\n",
      "those which precede and those which follow them. They have a\n",
      "revolutionary grandeur. Precipices are to be distinguished there. The\n",
      "social masses, the very assizes of civilization, the solid group of\n",
      "superposed and adhering interests, the century-old profiles of the\n",
      "ancient French formation, appear and disappear in them every instant,\n",
      "athwart the storm clouds of systems, of passions, and of theories.\n",
      "These appearances and disappearances have been designated as movement\n",
      "and resistance. At intervals, truth, that daylight of the human soul,\n",
      "can be descried shining there.\n",
      "\n",
      "This remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning to be\n",
      "sufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping the principal\n",
      "lines even at the present day.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shall make the attempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Restoration had been one of those intermediate phases, hard to\n",
      "define, in which there is fatigue, buzzing, murmurs, sleep, tumult, and\n",
      "which are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a\n",
      "halting-place.\n",
      "\n",
      "These epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire to\n",
      "convert them to profit. In the beginning, the nation asks nothing but\n",
      "repose; it thirsts for but one thing, peace; it has but one ambition,\n",
      "to be small. Which is the translation of remaining tranquil. Of great\n",
      "events, great hazards, great adventures, great men, thank God, we have\n",
      "seen enough, we have them heaped higher than our heads. We would\n",
      "exchange Cæsar for Prusias, and Napoleon for the King of Yvetot. “What\n",
      "a good little king was he!” We have marched since daybreak, we have\n",
      "reached the evening of a long and toilsome day; we have made our first\n",

      "what? A shelter. They have it. They take possession of peace, of\n",
      "tranquillity, of leisure; behold, they are content. But, at the same\n",
      "time certain facts arise, compel recognition, and knock at the door in\n",
      "their turn. These facts are the products of revolutions and wars, they\n",
      "are, they exist, they have the right to install themselves in society,\n",
      "and they do install themselves therein; and most of the time, facts are\n",
      "the stewards of the household and fouriers32 who do nothing but prepare\n",
      "lodgings for principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, then, is what appears to philosophical politicians:—\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time that weary men demand repose, accomplished facts\n",
      "demand guarantees. Guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to\n",
      "men.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what England demanded of the Stuarts after the Protector; this\n",
      "is what France demanded of the Bourbons after the Empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "These guarantees are a necessity of the times. They must be accorded.\n",
      "Princes “grant” them, but in reality, it is the force of things which\n",
      "gives them. A profound truth, and one useful to know, which the Stuarts\n",
      "did not suspect in 1662 and which the Bourbons did not even obtain a\n",
      "glimpse of in 1814.\n",
      "\n",
      "The predestined family, which returned to France when Napoleon fell,\n",
      "had the fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which bestowed,\n",
      "and that what it had bestowed it could take back again; that the House\n",
      "of Bourbon possessed the right divine, that France possessed nothing,\n",
      "and that the political right conceded in the charter of Louis XVIII.\n",
      "was merely a branch of the right divine, was detached by the House of\n",
      "Bourbon and graciously given to the people until such day as it should\n",
      "please the King to reassume it. Still, the House of Bourbon should have\n",
      "felt, from the displeasure created by the gift, that it did not come\n",
      "from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This house was churlish to the nineteenth century. It put on an\n",
      "ill-tempered look at every development of the nation. To make use of a\n",
      "trivial word, that is to say, of a popular and a true word, it looked\n",
      "glum. The people saw this.\n",
      "\n",
      "It thought it possessed strength because the Empire had been carried\n",
      "away before it like a theatrical stage-setting. It did not perceive\n",
      "that it had, itself, been brought in in the same fashion. It did not\n",
      "perceive that it also lay in that hand which had removed Napoleon.\n",
      "\n",
      "It thought that it had roots, because it was the past. It was mistaken;\n",
      "it formed a part of the past, but the whole past was France. The roots\n",
      "of French society were not fixed in the Bourbons, but in the nations.\n",
      "These obscure and lively roots constituted, not the right of a family,\n",
      "but the history of a people. They were everywhere, except under the\n",
      "throne.\n",
      "\n",
      "The House of Bourbon was to France the illustrious and bleeding knot in\n",
      "her history, but was no longer the principal element of her destiny,\n",
      "and the necessary base of her politics. She could get along without the\n",
      "Bourbons; she had done without them for two and twenty years; there had\n",
      "been a break of continuity; they did not suspect the fact. And how\n",
      "should they have suspected it, they who fancied that Louis XVII.\n",
      "reigned on the 9th of Thermidor, and that Louis XVIII. was reigning at\n",
      "the battle of Marengo? Never, since the origin of history, had princes\n",
      "been so blind in the presence of facts and the portion of divine\n",
      "authority which facts contain and promulgate. Never had that pretension\n",
      "here below which is called the right of kings denied to such a point\n",
      "the right from on high.\n",
      "\n",
      "A capital error which led this family to lay its hand once more on the\n",
      "guarantees “granted” in 1814, on the concessions, as it termed them.\n",
      "Sad. A sad thing! What it termed its concessions were our conquests;\n",
      "what it termed our encroachments were our rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the hour seemed to it to have come, the Restoration, supposing\n",
      "itself victorious over Bonaparte and well-rooted in the country, that\n",
      "is to say, believing itself to be strong and deep, abruptly decided on\n",
      "its plan of action, and risked its stroke. One morning it drew itself\n",
      "up before the face of France, and, elevating its voice, it contested\n",
      "the collective title and the individual right of the nation to\n",
      "sovereignty, of the citizen to liberty. In other words, it denied to\n",
      "the nation that which made it a nation, and to the citizen that which\n",
      "made him a citizen.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the foundation of those famous acts which are called the\n",
      "ordinances of July. The Restoration fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "It fell justly. But, we admit, it had not been absolutely hostile to\n",
      "all forms of progress. Great things had been accomplished, with it\n",
      "alongside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the Restoration, the nation had grown accustomed to calm\n",
      "discussion, which had been lacking under the Republic, and to grandeur\n",
      "in peace, which had been wanting under the Empire. France free and\n",
      "strong had offered an encouraging spectacle to the other peoples of\n",
      "Europe. The Revolution had had the word under Robespierre; the cannon\n",
      "had had the word under Bonaparte; it was under Louis XVIII. and Charles\n",
      "X. that it was the turn of intelligence to have the word. The wind\n",
      "ceased, the torch was lighted once more. On the lofty heights, the pure\n",
      "light of mind could be seen flickering. A magnificent, useful, and\n",
      "charming spectacle. For a space of fifteen years, those great\n",
      "principles which are so old for the thinker, so new for the statesman,\n",
      "could be seen at work in perfect peace, on the public square; equality\n",
      "before the law, liberty of conscience, liberty of speech, liberty of\n",
      "the press, the accessibility of all aptitudes to all functions. Thus it\n",
      "proceeded until 1830. The Bourbons were an instrument of civilization\n",
      "which broke in the hands of Providence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fall of the Bourbons was full of grandeur, not on their side, but\n",
      "on the side of the nation. They quitted the throne with gravity, but\n",
      "without authority; their descent into the night was not one of those\n",
      "solemn disappearances which leave a sombre emotion in history; it was\n",
      "neither the spectral calm of Charles I., nor the eagle scream of\n",
      "Napoleon. They departed, that is all. They laid down the crown, and\n",
      "retained no aureole. They were worthy, but they were not august. They\n",
      "lacked, in a certain measure, the majesty of their misfortune. Charles\n",
      "X. during the voyage from Cherbourg, causing a round table to be cut\n",
      "over into a square table, appeared to be more anxious about imperilled\n",
      "etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy. This diminution saddened\n",
      "devoted men who loved their persons, and serious men who honored their\n",
      "race. The populace was admirable. The nation, attacked one morning with\n",
      "weapons, by a sort of royal insurrection, felt itself in the possession\n",
      "of so much force that it did not go into a rage. It defended itself,\n",
      "restrained itself, restored things to their places, the government to\n",
      "law, the Bourbons to exile, alas! and then halted! It took the old king\n",
      "Charles X. from beneath that dais which had sheltered Louis XIV. and\n",
      "set him gently on the ground. It touched the royal personages only with\n",
      "sadness and precaution. It was not one man, it was not a few men, it\n",
      "was France, France entire, France victorious and intoxicated with her\n",
      "victory, who seemed to be coming to herself, and who put into practice,\n",
      "before the eyes of the whole world, these grave words of Guillaume du\n",
      "Vair after the day of the Barricades:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the favors of the\n",
      "great, and to spring, like a bird from bough to bough, from an\n",
      "afflicted fortune to a flourishing one, to show themselves harsh\n",

      "just stated, their misfortune was greater than they were. They faded\n",
      "out in the horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Revolution of July instantly had friends and enemies throughout the\n",
      "entire world. The first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm, the\n",
      "others turned away, each according to his nature. At the first blush,\n",
      "the princes of Europe, the owls of this dawn, shut their eyes, wounded\n",
      "and stupefied, and only opened them to threaten. A fright which can be\n",
      "comprehended, a wrath which can be pardoned. This strange revolution\n",
      "had hardly produced a shock; it had not even paid to vanquished royalty\n",
      "the honor of treating it as an enemy, and of shedding its blood. In the\n",
      "eyes of despotic governments, who are always interested in having\n",
      "liberty calumniate itself, the Revolution of July committed the fault\n",
      "of being formidable and of remaining gentle. Nothing, however, was\n",
      "attempted or plotted against it. The most discontented, the most\n",
      "irritated, the most trembling, saluted it; whatever our egotism and our\n",

      "sensible of the collaboration of some one who is working above man.\n",

      "service of opinions modern; he loved Poland and Hungary, but he wrote\n",
      "_les Polonois_, and he pronounced _les Hongrais_. He wore the uniform\n",
      "of the national guard, like Charles X., and the ribbon of the Legion of\n",
      "Honor, like Napoleon.\n",
      "\n",

      "this made a part of his bourgeois popularity. He had no heart. He went\n",

      "the real country by the legal country, on half shares with three\n",
      "hundred thousand privileged persons,—these are the deeds of royalty;\n",
      "Belgium refused, Algeria too harshly conquered, and, as in the case of\n",
      "India by the English, with more barbarism than civilization, the breach\n",
      "of faith, to Abd-el-Kader, Blaye, Deutz bought, Pritchard paid,—these\n",
      "are the doings of the reign; the policy which was more domestic than\n",
      "national was the doing of the King.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "We will state it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Louis Philippe was rather too much of a paternal king; that incubation\n",
      "of a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of\n",
      "everything and does not like to be disturbed; hence excessive timidity,\n",
      "which is displeasing to the people, who have the 14th of July in their\n",
      "civil and Austerlitz in their military tradition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled\n",
      "first of all, that deep tenderness of Louis Philippe towards his family\n",
      "was deserved by the family. That domestic group was worthy of\n",
      "admiration. Virtues there dwelt side by side with talents. One of Louis\n",
      "Philippe’s daughters, Marie d’Orleans, placed the name of her race\n",
      "among artists, as Charles d’Orleans had placed it among poets. She made\n",
      "of her soul a marble which she named Jeanne d’Arc. Two of Louis\n",
      "Philippe’s daughters elicited from Metternich this eulogium: “They are\n",
      "young people such as are rarely seen, and princes such as are never\n",
      "seen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This, without any dissimulation, and also without any exaggeration, is\n",
      "the truth about Louis Philippe.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be Prince Equality, to bear in his own person the contradiction of\n",
      "the Restoration and the Revolution, to have that disquieting side of\n",
      "the revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power, therein\n",
      "lay the fortune of Louis Philippe in 1830; never was there a more\n",
      "complete adaptation of a man to an event; the one entered into the\n",
      "other, and the incarnation took place. Louis Philippe is 1830 made man.\n",
      "Moreover, he had in his favor that great recommendation to the throne,\n",
      "exile. He had been proscribed, a wanderer, poor. He had lived by his\n",
      "own labor. In Switzerland, this heir to the richest princely domains in\n",
      "France had sold an old horse in order to obtain bread. At Reichenau, he\n",
      "gave lessons in mathematics, while his sister Adelaide did wool work\n",
      "and sewed. These souvenirs connected with a king rendered the\n",
      "bourgeoisie enthusiastic. He had, with his own hands, demolished the\n",
      "iron cage of Mont-Saint-Michel, built by Louis XI., and used by Louis\n",
      "XV. He was the companion of Dumouriez, he was the friend of Lafayette;\n",
      "he had belonged to the Jacobins’ club; Mirabeau had slapped him on the\n",
      "shoulder; Danton had said to him: “Young man!” At the age of four and\n",
      "twenty, in ’93, being then M. de Chartres, he had witnessed, from the\n",
      "depth of a box, the trial of Louis XVI., so well named _that poor\n",
      "tyrant_. The blind clairvoyance of the Revolution, breaking royalty in\n",
      "the King and the King with royalty, did so almost without noticing the\n",
      "man in the fierce crushing of the idea, the vast storm of the\n",
      "Assembly-Tribunal, the public wrath interrogating, Capet not knowing\n",
      "what to reply, the alarming, stupefied vacillation by that royal head\n",
      "beneath that sombre breath, the relative innocence of all in that\n",
      "catastrophe, of those who condemned as well as of the man condemned,—he\n",
      "had looked on those things, he had contemplated that giddiness; he had\n",
      "seen the centuries appear before the bar of the Assembly-Convention; he\n",
      "had beheld, behind Louis XVI., that unfortunate passer-by who was made\n",
      "responsible, the terrible culprit, the monarchy, rise through the\n",
      "shadows; and there had lingered in his soul the respectful fear of\n",

      "The trace left in him by the Revolution was prodigious. Its memory was\n",
      "like a living imprint of those great years, minute by minute. One day,\n",
      "in the presence of a witness whom we are not permitted to doubt, he\n",

      "The laws of September are open to sight. Although fully aware of the\n",
      "gnawing power of light on privileges, he left his throne exposed to the\n",
      "light. History will do justice to him for this loyalty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Louis Philippe, like all historical men who have passed from the scene,\n",
      "is to-day put on his trial by the human conscience. His case is, as\n",

      "\n",
      "The hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent, has\n",

      "and in any case, from the superior point of view where philosophy must\n",
      "place itself, we cannot judge him here, as the reader has seen above,\n",
      "except with certain reservations in the name of the absolute democratic\n",
      "principle; in the eyes of the absolute, outside these two rights, the\n",
      "right of man in the first place, the right of the people in the second,\n",
      "all is usurpation; but what we can say, even at the present day, that\n",

      "whatever manner he is considered, Louis Philippe, taken in himself, and\n",
      "from the point of view of human goodness, will remain, to use the\n",
      "antique language of ancient history, one of the best princes who ever\n",
      "sat on a throne.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is there against him? That throne. Take away Louis Philippe the\n",
      "king, there remains the man. And the man is good. He is good at times\n",
      "even to the point of being admirable. Often, in the midst of his\n",
      "gravest souvenirs, after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of\n",
      "the continent, he returned at night to his apartments, and there,\n",
      "exhausted with fatigue, overwhelmed with sleep, what did he do? He took\n",
      "a death sentence and passed the night in revising a criminal suit,\n",
      "considering it something to hold his own against Europe, but that it\n",
      "was a still greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner. He\n",
      "obstinately maintained his opinion against his keeper of the seals; he\n",
      "disputed the ground with the guillotine foot by foot against the crown\n",
      "attorneys, those _chatterers of the law_, as he called them. Sometimes\n",
      "the pile of sentences covered his table; he examined them all; it was\n",
      "anguish to him to abandon these miserable, condemned heads. One day, he\n",
      "said to the same witness to whom we have recently referred: “I won\n",
      "seven last night.” During the early years of his reign, the death\n",
      "penalty was as good as abolished, and the erection of a scaffold was a\n",
      "violence committed against the King. The Grève having disappeared with\n",
      "the elder branch, a bourgeois place of execution was instituted under\n",
      "the name of the Barrière-Saint-Jacques; “practical men” felt the\n",
      "necessity of a quasi-legitimate guillotine; and this was one of the\n",
      "victories of Casimir Périer, who represented the narrow sides of the\n",
      "bourgeoisie, over Louis Philippe, who represented its liberal sides.\n",
      "Louis Philippe annotated Beccaria with his own hand. After the Fieschi\n",
      "machine, he exclaimed: “What a pity that I was not wounded! Then I\n",
      "might have pardoned!” On another occasion, alluding to the resistance\n",
      "offered by his ministry, he wrote in connection with a political\n",

      "Louis Philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority\n",
      "without violence, without any direct action on his part, by virtue of a\n",
      "revolutionary change, evidently quite distinct from the real aim of the\n",
      "Revolution, but in which he, the Duc d’Orléans, exercised no personal\n",
      "initiative. He had been born a Prince, and he believed himself to have\n",
      "been elected King. He had not served this mandate on himself; he had\n",

      "convinced, wrongly, to be sure, but convinced nevertheless, that the\n",

      "attack, the amount of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs\n",
      "neither on the King nor on the democracy. A clash of principles\n",

      "the Municipalities. Thus the associations for the liberty of the press,\n",

      "was quivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult.\n",
      "Everything was in a state of agitation there, without any interruption,\n",

      "this lively yet sombre physiognomy. In this faubourg exists poignant\n",
      "distress hidden under attic roofs; there also exist rare and ardent\n",

      "The Faubourg Saint-Antoine had also other causes to tremble; for it\n",
      "received the counter-shock of commercial crises, of failures, strikes,\n",
      "slack seasons, all inherent to great political disturbances. In times\n",
      "of revolution misery is both cause and effect. The blow which it deals\n",

      "All were present at a secret meeting at the Café Musain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjolras said, mixing his words with a few half-enigmatical but\n",
      "significant metaphors:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is proper that we should know where we stand and on whom we may\n",
      "count. If combatants are required, they must be provided. It can do no\n",
      "harm to have something with which to strike. Passers-by always have\n",
      "more chance of being gored when there are bulls on the road than when\n",
      "there are none. Let us, therefore, reckon a little on the herd. How\n",
      "many of us are there? There is no question of postponing this task\n",
      "until to-morrow. Revolutionists should always be hurried; progress has\n",
      "no time to lose. Let us mistrust the unexpected. Let us not be caught\n",
      "unprepared. We must go over all the seams that we have made and see\n",
      "whether they hold fast. This business ought to be concluded to-day.\n",
      "Courfeyrac, you will see the polytechnic students. It is their day to\n",
      "go out. To-day is Wednesday. Feuilly, you will see those of the\n",
      "Glacière, will you not? Combeferre has promised me to go to Picpus.\n",
      "There is a perfect swarm and an excellent one there. Bahorel will visit\n",
      "the Estrapade. Prouvaire, the masons are growing lukewarm; you will\n",
      "bring us news from the lodge of the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honoré. Joly\n",
      "will go to Dupuytren’s clinical lecture, and feel the pulse of the\n",
      "medical school. Bossuet will take a little turn in the court and talk\n",
      "with the young law licentiates. I will take charge of the Cougourde\n",

      "\n",
      "“At the Barrière du Maine there are marble-workers, painters, and\n",
      "journeymen in the studios of sculptors. They are an enthusiastic\n",
      "family, but liable to cool off. I don’t know what has been the matter\n",
      "with them for some time past. They are thinking of something else. They\n",
      "are becoming extinguished. They pass their time playing dominoes. There\n",
      "is urgent need that some one should go and talk with them a little, but\n",
      "with firmness. They meet at Richefeu’s. They are to be found there\n",
      "between twelve and one o’clock. Those ashes must be fanned into a glow.\n",
      "For that errand I had counted on that abstracted Marius, who is a good\n",
      "fellow on the whole, but he no longer comes to us. I need some one for\n",
      "the Barrière du Maine. I have no one.”\n",

      "on a Robespierre waistcoat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Red,” said he as he entered, and he looked intently at Enjolras. Then,\n",
      "with the palm of his energetic hand, he laid the two scarlet points of\n",
      "the waistcoat across his breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "And stepping up to Enjolras, he whispered in his ear:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be easy.”\n",
      "\n",

      "He jammed his hat on resolutely and departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A quarter of an hour later, the back room of the Café Musain was\n",
      "deserted. All the friends of the A B C were gone, each in his own\n",
      "direction, each to his own task. Enjolras, who had reserved the\n",
      "Cougourde of Aix for himself, was the last to leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those members of the Cougourde of Aix who were in Paris then met on the\n",
      "plain of Issy, in one of the abandoned quarries which are so numerous\n",
      "in that side of Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Enjolras walked towards this place, he passed the whole situation in\n",
      "review in his own mind. The gravity of events was self-evident. When\n",
      "facts, the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady, move heavily,\n",
      "the slightest complication stops and entangles them. A phenomenon\n",
      "whence arises ruin and new births. Enjolras descried a luminous\n",
      "uplifting beneath the gloomy skirts of the future. Who knows? Perhaps\n",
      "the moment was at hand. The people were again taking possession of\n",
      "right, and what a fine spectacle! The revolution was again majestically\n",
      "taking possession of France and saying to the world: “The sequel\n",
      "to-morrow!” Enjolras was content. The furnace was being heated. He had\n",
      "at that moment a powder train of friends scattered all over Paris. He\n",
      "composed, in his own mind, with Combeferre’s philosophical and\n",
      "penetrating eloquence, Feuilly’s cosmopolitan enthusiasm, Courfeyrac’s\n",
      "dash, Bahorel’s smile, Jean Prouvaire’s melancholy, Joly’s science,\n",
      "Bossuet’s sarcasms, a sort of electric spark which took fire nearly\n",
      "everywhere at once. All hands to work. Surely, the result would answer\n",
      "to the effort. This was well. This made him think of Grantaire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold,” said he to himself, “the Barrière du Maine will not take me far\n",
      "out of my way. What if I were to go on as far as Richefeu’s? Let us\n",

      "He pushed open the door, entered, folded his arms, letting the door\n",
      "fall to and strike his shoulders, and gazed at that room filled with\n",
      "tables, men, and smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "A voice broke forth from the mist of smoke, interrupted by another\n",
      "voice. It was Grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary.\n",

      "Marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon\n",
      "whose track he had set Javert; but Javert had no sooner quitted the\n",
      "building, bearing off his prisoners in three hackney-coaches, than\n",
      "Marius also glided out of the house. It was only nine o’clock in the\n",
      "evening. Marius betook himself to Courfeyrac. Courfeyrac was no longer\n",
      "the imperturbable inhabitant of the Latin Quarter, he had gone to live\n",
      "in the Rue de la Verrerie “for political reasons”; this quarter was one\n",
      "where, at that epoch, insurrection liked to install itself. Marius said\n",
      "to Courfeyrac: “I have come to sleep with you.” Courfeyrac dragged a\n",
      "mattress off his bed, which was furnished with two, spread it out on\n",
      "the floor, and said: “There.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At seven o’clock on the following morning, Marius returned to the\n",
      "hovel, paid the quarter’s rent which he owed to Ma’am Bougon, had his\n",
      "books, his bed, his table, his commode, and his two chairs loaded on a\n",
      "hand-cart and went off without leaving his address, so that when Javert\n",
      "returned in the course of the morning, for the purpose of questioning\n",
      "Marius as to the events of the preceding evening, he found only Ma’am\n",
      "Bougon, who answered: “Moved away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ma’am Bougon was convinced that Marius was to some extent an accomplice\n",
      "of the robbers who had been seized the night before. “Who would ever\n",
      "have said it?” she exclaimed to the portresses of the quarter, “a young\n",
      "man like that, who had the air of a girl!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence. The first\n",
      "was, that he now had a horror of that house, where he had beheld, so\n",
      "close at hand, and in its most repulsive and most ferocious\n",
      "development, a social deformity which is, perhaps, even more terrible\n",
      "than the wicked rich man, the wicked poor man. The second was, that he\n",
      "did not wish to figure in the lawsuit which would insue in all\n",
      "probability, and be brought in to testify against Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert thought that the young man, whose name he had forgotten, was\n",
      "afraid, and had fled, or perhaps, had not even returned home at the\n",
      "time of the ambush; he made some efforts to find him, however, but\n",
      "without success.\n",
      "\n",
      "A month passed, then another. Marius was still with Courfeyrac. He had\n",
      "learned from a young licentiate in law, an habitual frequenter of the\n",
      "courts, that Thénardier was in close confinement. Every Monday, Marius\n",
      "had five francs handed in to the clerk’s office of La Force for\n",
      "Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Marius had no longer any money, he borrowed the five francs from\n",
      "Courfeyrac. It was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed\n",
      "money. These periodical five francs were a double riddle to Courfeyrac\n",
      "who lent and to Thénardier who received them. “To whom can they go?”\n",
      "thought Courfeyrac. “Whence can this come to me?” Thénardier asked\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Marius was heart-broken. Everything had plunged through a\n",
      "trap-door once more. He no longer saw anything before him; his life was\n",
      "again buried in mystery where he wandered fumblingly. He had for a\n",
      "moment beheld very close at hand, in that obscurity, the young girl\n",
      "whom he loved, the old man who seemed to be her father, those unknown\n",
      "beings, who were his only interest and his only hope in this world;\n",
      "and, at the very moment when he thought himself on the point of\n",
      "grasping them, a gust had swept all these shadows away. Not a spark of\n",
      "certainty and truth had been emitted even in the most terrible of\n",
      "collisions. No conjecture was possible. He no longer knew even the name\n",
      "that he thought he knew. It certainly was not Ursule. And the Lark was\n",
      "a nickname. And what was he to think of the old man? Was he actually in\n",
      "hiding from the police? The white-haired workman whom Marius had\n",
      "encountered in the vicinity of the Invalides recurred to his mind. It\n",
      "now seemed probable that that workingman and M. Leblanc were one and\n",
      "the same person. So he disguised himself? That man had his heroic and\n",
      "his equivocal sides. Why had he not called for help? Why had he fled?\n",
      "Was he, or was he not, the father of the young girl? Was he, in short,\n",
      "the man whom Thénardier thought that he recognized? Thénardier might\n",
      "have been mistaken. These formed so many insoluble problems. All this,\n",
      "it is true, detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl\n",
      "of the Luxembourg. Heart-rending distress; Marius bore a passion in his\n",
      "heart, and night over his eyes. He was thrust onward, he was drawn, and\n",
      "he could not stir. All had vanished, save love. Of love itself he had\n",
      "lost the instincts and the sudden illuminations. Ordinarily, this flame\n",
      "which burns us lights us also a little, and casts some useful gleams\n",
      "without. But Marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of\n",
      "passion. He never said to himself: “What if I were to go to such a\n",
      "place? What if I were to try such and such a thing?” The girl whom he\n",
      "could no longer call Ursule was evidently somewhere; nothing warned\n",
      "Marius in what direction he should seek her. His whole life was now\n",
      "summed up in two words; absolute uncertainty within an impenetrable\n",
      "fog. To see her once again; he still aspired to this, but he no longer\n",
      "expected it.\n",
      "\n",
      "To crown all, his poverty had returned. He felt that icy breath close\n",
      "to him, on his heels. In the midst of his torments, and long before\n",
      "this, he had discontinued his work, and nothing is more dangerous than\n",
      "discontinued work; it is a habit which vanishes. A habit which is easy\n",
      "to get rid of, and difficult to take up again.\n",
      "\n",
      "A certain amount of dreaming is good, like a narcotic in discreet\n",
      "doses. It lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor, which are\n",
      "sometimes severe, and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor\n",
      "which corrects the over-harsh contours of pure thought, fills in gaps\n",
      "here and there, binds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas.\n",
      "But too much dreaming sinks and drowns. Woe to the brain-worker who\n",
      "allows himself to fall entirely from thought into reverie! He thinks\n",
      "that he can re-ascend with equal ease, and he tells himself that, after\n",
      "all, it is the same thing. Error!\n",
      "\n",
      "Thought is the toil of the intelligence, reverie its voluptuousness. To\n",
      "replace thought with reverie is to confound a poison with a food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius had begun in that way, as the reader will remember. Passion had\n",
      "supervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimæras\n",
      "without object or bottom. One no longer emerges from one’s self except\n",
      "for the purpose of going off to dream. Idle production. Tumultuous and\n",
      "stagnant gulf. And, in proportion as labor diminishes, needs increase.\n",
      "This is a law. Man, in a state of reverie, is generally prodigal and\n",
      "slack; the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is, in that mode of life, good mingled with evil, for if\n",
      "enervation is baleful, generosity is good and healthful. But the poor\n",
      "man who is generous and noble, and who does not work, is lost.\n",
      "Resources are exhausted, needs crop up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest as well as\n",

      "Inquiries were instituted, and on consulting the tariff of commissions\n",

      "ten sous; one to Val-de-Grâce, fifteen sous; and one to the Barrière de\n",

      "ex-convict, and Barre-Carosse, upon whom the attention of the police\n",
      "was directed by this incident. It was thought that these men were\n",
      "members of Patron Minette; two of those leaders, Babet and Gueulemer,\n",
      "had been captured. It was supposed that the messages, which had been\n",
      "addressed, not to houses, but to people who were waiting for them in\n",
      "the street, must have contained information with regard to some crime\n",
      "that had been plotted. They were in possession of other indications;\n",
      "they laid hand on the three prowlers, and supposed that they had\n",
      "circumvented some one or other of Brujon’s machinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "About a week after these measures had been taken, one night, as the\n",
      "superintendent of the watch, who had been inspecting the lower\n",
      "dormitory in the Bâtiment-Neuf, was about to drop his chestnut in the\n",
      "box—this was the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen performed\n",

      "through the peep-hole of the dormitory and beheld Brujon sitting on his\n",
      "bed and writing something by the light of the hall-lamp. The guardian\n",
      "entered, Brujon was put in a solitary cell for a month, but they were\n",
      "not able to seize what he had written. The police learned nothing\n",
      "further about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is certain is, that on the following morning, a “postilion” was\n",

      "five-story building which separated the two court-yards.\n",
      "\n",
      "What prisoners call a “postilion” is a pallet of bread artistically\n",
      "moulded, which is sent _into Ireland_, that is to say, over the roofs\n",
      "of a prison, from one courtyard to another. Etymology: over England;\n",
      "from one land to another; _into Ireland_. This little pellet falls in\n",
      "the yard. The man who picks it up opens it and finds in it a note\n",
      "addressed to some prisoner in that yard. If it is a prisoner who finds\n",
      "the treasure, he forwards the note to its destination; if it is a\n",
      "keeper, or one of the prisoners secretly sold who are called _sheep_ in\n",
      "prisons and _foxes_ in the galleys, the note is taken to the office and\n",
      "handed over to the police.\n",

      "On this occasion, the postilion reached its address, although the\n",
      "person to whom it was addressed was, at that moment, in solitary\n",

      "on from La Force to the Salpêtrière, to a “good friend” whom he had and\n",
      "who was shut up there. This woman in turn transmitted the note to\n",
      "another woman of her acquaintance, a certain Magnon, who was strongly\n",
      "suspected by the police, though not yet arrested. This Magnon, whose\n",

      "which will be described in detail later on, and she could, by going to\n",
      "see Éponine, serve as a bridge between the Salpêtrière and Les\n",
      "Madelonettes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened, that at precisely that moment, as proofs were wanting in\n",
      "the investigation directed against Thénardier in the matter of his\n",
      "daughters, Éponine and Azelma were released. When Éponine came out,\n",
      "Magnon, who was watching the gate of the Madelonettes, handed her\n",
      "Brujon’s note to Babet, charging her to look into the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Éponine went to the Rue Plumet, recognized the gate and the garden,\n",
      "observed the house, spied, lurked, and, a few days later, brought to\n",
      "Magnon, who delivers in the Rue Clocheperce, a biscuit, which Magnon\n",
      "transmitted to Babet’s mistress in the Salpêtrière. A biscuit, in the\n",
      "shady symbolism of prisons, signifies: Nothing to be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that in less than a week from that time, as Brujon and Babet met in\n",

      "Brujon in La Force miscarry.\n",
      "\n",
      "This miscarriage had its consequences, however, which were perfectly\n",
      "distinct from Brujon’s programme. The reader will see what they were.\n",

      "good exposure, to make his trials with indigo “at his own expense.” For\n",
      "this purpose he had pawned his copperplates of the _Flora_. He had\n",

      "and the young man passed each other on the Boulevard de l’Hôpital. They\n",

      "was nothing in the hutch, but there were a few apples in the\n",
      "fruit-closet,—the remains of the winter’s provision.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading, with the aid of\n",
      "his glasses, two books of which he was passionately fond and in which,\n",
      "a serious thing at his age, he was interested. His natural timidity\n",
      "rendered him accessible to the acceptance of superstitions in a certain\n",
      "degree. The first of these books was the famous treatise of President\n",
      "Delancre, _De l’Inconstance des Démons_; the other was a quarto by\n",
      "Mutor de la Rubaudière, _Sur les Diables de Vauvert et les Gobelins de\n",
      "la Bièvre_. This last-mentioned old volume interested him all the more,\n",
      "because his garden had been one of the spots haunted by goblins in\n",
      "former times. The twilight had begun to whiten what was on high and to\n",
      "blacken all below. As he read, over the top of the book which he held\n",
      "in his hand, Father Mabeuf was surveying his plants, and among others a\n",
      "magnificent rhododendron which was one of his consolations; four days\n",
      "of heat, wind, and sun without a drop of rain, had passed; the stalks\n",
      "were bending, the buds drooping, the leaves falling; all this needed\n",
      "water, the rhododendron was particularly sad. Father Mabeuf was one of\n",
      "those persons for whom plants have souls. The old man had toiled all\n",
      "day over his indigo plot, he was worn out with fatigue, but he rose,\n",
      "laid his books on the bench, and walked, all bent over and with\n",
      "tottering footsteps, to the well, but when he had grasped the chain, he\n",
      "could not even draw it sufficiently to unhook it. Then he turned round\n",
      "and cast a glance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded\n",
      "with stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man\n",
      "beneath an indescribably mournful and eternal joy. The night promised\n",
      "to be as arid as the day had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stars everywhere!” thought the old man; “not the tiniest cloud! Not a\n",
      "drop of water!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And his head, which had been upraised for a moment, fell back upon his\n",
      "breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "He raised it again, and once more looked at the sky, murmuring:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“A tear of dew! A little pity!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He tried again to unhook the chain of the well, and could not.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, he heard a voice saying:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father Mabeuf, would you like to have me water your garden for you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, a noise as of a wild animal passing became audible in\n",
      "the hedge, and he beheld emerging from the shrubbery a sort of tall,\n",
      "slender girl, who drew herself up in front of him and stared boldly at\n",
      "him. She had less the air of a human being than of a form which had\n",
      "just blossomed forth from the twilight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Father Mabeuf, who was easily terrified, and who was, as we have\n",
      "said, quick to take alarm, was able to reply by a single syllable, this\n",
      "being, whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness,\n",
      "had unhooked the chain, plunged in and withdrawn the bucket, and filled\n",
      "the watering-pot, and the goodman beheld this apparition, which had\n",
      "bare feet and a tattered petticoat, running about among the flower-beds\n",
      "distributing life around her. The sound of the watering-pot on the\n",
      "leaves filled Father Mabeuf’s soul with ecstasy. It seemed to him that\n",
      "the rhododendron was happy now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first bucketful emptied, the girl drew a second, then a third. She\n",
      "watered the whole garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something about her, as she thus ran about among paths, where\n",
      "her outline appeared perfectly black, waving her angular arms, and with\n",
      "her fichu all in rags, that resembled a bat.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she had finished, Father Mabeuf approached her with tears in his\n",
      "eyes, and laid his hand on her brow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“God will bless you,” said he, “you are an angel since you take care of\n",
      "the flowers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” she replied. “I am the devil, but that’s all the same to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man exclaimed, without either waiting for or hearing her\n",
      "response:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a pity that I am so unhappy and so poor, and that I can do\n",
      "nothing for you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can do something,” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Tell me where M. Marius lives.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The old man did not understand. “What Monsieur Marius?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He raised his glassy eyes and seemed to be seeking something that had\n",
      "vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A young man who used to come here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, M. Mabeuf had searched his memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! yes—” he exclaimed. “I know what you mean. Wait! Monsieur\n",
      "Marius—the Baron Marius Pontmercy, parbleu! He lives,—or rather, he no\n",
      "longer lives,—ah well, I don’t know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke, he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron, and he\n",
      "continued:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold, I know now. He very often passes along the boulevard, and goes\n",
      "in the direction of the Glacière, Rue Croulebarbe. The meadow of the\n",
      "Lark. Go there. It is not hard to meet him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When M. Mabeuf straightened himself up, there was no longer any one\n",
      "there; the girl had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was decidedly terrified.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really,” he thought, “if my garden had not been watered, I should\n",
      "think that she was a spirit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "An hour later, when he was in bed, it came back to him, and as he fell\n",

      "which changes itself into a fish in order to cross the sea, little by\n",
      "little assumes the form of a dream in order to traverse slumber, he\n",
      "said to himself in a bewildered way:—\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some days after this visit of a “spirit” to Farmer Mabeuf, one\n",
      "morning,—it was on a Monday, the day when Marius borrowed the\n",
      "hundred-sou piece from Courfeyrac for Thénardier—Marius had put this\n",
      "coin in his pocket, and before carrying it to the clerk’s office, he\n",
      "had gone “to take a little stroll,” in the hope that this would make\n",
      "him work on his return. It was always thus, however. As soon as he\n",
      "rose, he seated himself before a book and a sheet of paper in order to\n",
      "scribble some translation; his task at that epoch consisted in turning\n",
      "into French a celebrated quarrel between Germans, the Gans and Savigny\n",
      "controversy; he took Savigny, he took Gans, read four lines, tried to\n",
      "write one, could not, saw a star between him and his paper, and rose\n",
      "from his chair, saying: “I shall go out. That will put me in spirits.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And off he went to the Lark’s meadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "There he beheld more than ever the star, and less than ever Savigny and\n",
      "Gans.\n",
      "\n",
      "He returned home, tried to take up his work again, and did not succeed;\n",
      "there was no means of re-knotting a single one of the threads which\n",
      "were broken in his brain; then he said to himself: “I will not go out\n",
      "to-morrow. It prevents my working.” And he went out every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "He lived in the Lark’s meadow more than in Courfeyrac’s lodgings. That\n",
      "was his real address: Boulevard de la Santé, at the seventh tree from\n",
      "the Rue Croulebarbe.\n",
      "\n",
      "That morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself on\n",
      "the parapet of the River des Gobelins. A cheerful sunlight penetrated\n",
      "the freshly unfolded and luminous leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was dreaming of “Her.” And his meditation turning to a reproach,\n",
      "fell back upon himself; he reflected dolefully on his idleness, his\n",
      "paralysis of soul, which was gaining on him, and of that night which\n",
      "was growing more dense every moment before him, to such a point that he\n",
      "no longer even saw the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, athwart this painful extrication of indistinct ideas\n",
      "which was not even a monologue, so feeble had action become in him, and\n",
      "he had no longer the force to care to despair, athwart this melancholy\n",
      "absorption, sensations from without did reach him. He heard behind him,\n",
      "beneath him, on both banks of the river, the laundresses of the\n",
      "Gobelins beating their linen, and above his head, the birds chattering\n",
      "and singing in the elm-trees. On the one hand, the sound of liberty,\n",
      "the careless happiness of the leisure which has wings; on the other,\n",
      "the sound of toil. What caused him to meditate deeply, and almost\n",
      "reflect, were two cheerful sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once, in the midst of his dejected ecstasy, he heard a familiar\n",
      "voice saying:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come! Here he is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He raised his eyes, and recognized that wretched child who had come to\n",
      "him one morning, the elder of the Thénardier daughters, Éponine; he\n",
      "knew her name now. Strange to say, she had grown poorer and prettier,\n",
      "two steps which it had not seemed within her power to take. She had\n",
      "accomplished a double progress, towards the light and towards distress.\n",
      "She was barefooted and in rags, as on the day when she had so\n",
      "resolutely entered his chamber, only her rags were two months older\n",
      "now, the holes were larger, the tatters more sordid. It was the same\n",
      "harsh voice, the same brow dimmed and wrinkled with tan, the same free,\n",
      "wild, and vacillating glance. She had besides, more than formerly, in\n",
      "her face that indescribably terrified and lamentable something which\n",
      "sojourn in a prison adds to wretchedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had bits of straw and hay in her hair, not like Ophelia through\n",
      "having gone mad from the contagion of Hamlet’s madness, but because she\n",
      "had slept in the loft of some stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in spite of it all, she was beautiful. What a star art thou, O\n",
      "youth!\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, she had halted in front of Marius with a trace of joy\n",
      "in her livid countenance, and something which resembled a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stood for several moments as though incapable of speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So I have met you at last!” she said at length. “Father Mabeuf was\n",
      "right, it was on this boulevard! How I have hunted for you! If you only\n",
      "knew! Do you know? I have been in the jug. A fortnight! They let me\n",
      "out! seeing that there was nothing against me, and that, moreover, I\n",
      "had not reached years of discretion. I lack two months of it. Oh! how I\n",
      "have hunted for you! These six weeks! So you don’t live down there any\n",
      "more?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Marius.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! I understand. Because of that affair. Those take-downs are\n",
      "disagreeable. You cleared out. Come now! Why do you wear old hats like\n",
      "this! A young man like you ought to have fine clothes. Do you know,\n",
      "Monsieur Marius, Father Mabeuf calls you Baron Marius, I don’t know\n",
      "what. It isn’t true that you are a baron? Barons are old fellows, they\n",
      "go to the Luxembourg, in front of the château, where there is the most\n",
      "sun, and they read the _Quotidienne_ for a sou. I once carried a letter\n",
      "to a baron of that sort. He was over a hundred years old. Say, where do\n",
      "you live now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius made no reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” she went on, “you have a hole in your shirt. I must sew it up for\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She resumed with an expression which gradually clouded over:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t seem glad to see me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius held his peace; she remained silent for a moment, then\n",
      "exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“But if I choose, nevertheless, I could force you to look glad!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What?” demanded Marius. “What do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! you used to call me _thou_,” she retorted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, what dost thou mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She bit her lips; she seemed to hesitate, as though a prey to some sort\n",
      "of inward conflict. At last she appeared to come to a decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So much the worse, I don’t care. You have a melancholy air, I want you\n",
      "to be pleased. Only promise me that you will smile. I want to see you\n",
      "smile and hear you say: ‘Ah, well, that’s good.’ Poor Mr. Marius! you\n",
      "know? You promised me that you would give me anything I like—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes! Only speak!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I have the address.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius turned pale. All the blood flowed back to his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What address?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The address that you asked me to get!”\n",

      "\n",
      "“The address—you know very well!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes!” stammered Marius.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of that young lady.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This word uttered, she sighed deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seized\n",
      "her hand distractedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Well! lead me thither! Tell me! Ask of me anything you wish! Where\n",
      "is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come with me,” she responded. “I don’t know the street or number very\n",
      "well; it is in quite the other direction from here, but I know the\n",
      "house well, I will take you to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She withdrew her hand and went on, in a tone which could have rent the\n",
      "heart of an observer, but which did not even graze Marius in his\n",

      "\n",
      "“Oh! how glad you are!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Swear!” said she, “what does that mean? Come! You want me to swear?”\n",

      "It will be remembered that Jean Valjean was happy in the convent, so\n",
      "happy that his conscience finally took the alarm. He saw Cosette every\n",
      "day, he felt paternity spring up and develop within him more and more,\n",
      "he brooded over the soul of that child, he said to himself that she was\n",
      "his, that nothing could take her from him, that this would last\n",
      "indefinitely, that she would certainly become a nun, being thereto\n",
      "gently incited every day, that thus the convent was henceforth the\n",
      "universe for her as it was for him, that he should grow old there, and\n",
      "that she would grow up there, that she would grow old there, and that\n",
      "he should die there; that, in short, delightful hope, no separation was\n",
      "possible. On reflecting upon this, he fell into perplexity. He\n",
      "interrogated himself. He asked himself if all that happiness were\n",
      "really his, if it were not composed of the happiness of another, of the\n",
      "happiness of that child which he, an old man, was confiscating and\n",
      "stealing; if that were not theft? He said to himself, that this child\n",
      "had a right to know life before renouncing it, that to deprive her in\n",
      "advance, and in some sort without consulting her, of all joys, under\n",
      "the pretext of saving her from all trials, to take advantage of her\n",
      "ignorance of her isolation, in order to make an artificial vocation\n",
      "germinate in her, was to rob a human creature of its nature and to lie\n",
      "to God. And who knows if, when she came to be aware of all this some\n",
      "day, and found herself a nun to her sorrow, Cosette would not come to\n",
      "hate him? A last, almost selfish thought, and less heroic than the\n",

      "convent.\n",
      "\n",
      "He resolved on this; he recognized with anguish, the fact that it was\n",
      "necessary. As for objections, there were none. Five years’ sojourn\n",
      "between these four walls and of disappearance had necessarily destroyed\n",
      "or dispersed the elements of fear. He could return tranquilly among\n",
      "men. He had grown old, and all had undergone a change. Who would\n",
      "recognize him now? And then, to face the worst, there was danger only\n",
      "for himself, and he had no right to condemn Cosette to the cloister for\n",
      "the reason that he had been condemned to the galleys. Besides, what is\n",
      "danger in comparison with the right? Finally, nothing prevented his\n",

      "\n",
      "As for Cosette’s education, it was almost finished and complete.\n",

      "\n",

      "brother, which permitted him henceforth to live without working, he\n",
      "should leave the service of the convent and take his daughter with him;\n",
      "but that, as it was not just that Cosette, since she had not taken the\n",

      "On leaving the convent, he took in his own arms the little valise the\n",
      "key to which he still wore on his person, and would permit no porter to\n",

      "Cosette and the servant occupied the pavilion; she had the big\n",

      "Cosette’s chamber, and, in order to redeem the severity of these\n",
      "magnificent old things, he had amalgamated with this bric-à-brac all\n",
      "the gay and graceful little pieces of furniture suitable to young\n",

      "like those on the bed, hung at the windows of the first floor. On the\n",
      "ground floor, the curtains were of tapestry. All winter long, Cosette’s\n",
      "little house was heated from top to bottom. Jean Valjean inhabited the\n",
      "sort of porter’s lodge which was situated at the end of the back\n",
      "courtyard, with a mattress on a folding-bed, a white wood table, two\n",
      "straw chairs, an earthenware water-jug, a few old volumes on a shelf,\n",
      "his beloved valise in one corner, and never any fire. He dined with\n",
      "Cosette, and he had a loaf of black bread on the table for his own use.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Toussaint came, he had said to her: “It is the young lady who is\n",
      "the mistress of this house.”—“And you, monsieur?” Toussaint replied in\n",

      "\n",

      "Cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent, and she regulated\n",

      "his arm through Cosette’s and took her for a walk. He led her to the\n",
      "Luxembourg, to the least frequented walk, and every Sunday he took her\n",
      "to mass at Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, because that was a long way off.\n",

      "Plumet. Toussaint brought their provisions, and Jean Valjean went\n",
      "himself for water to a fountain nearby on the boulevard. Their wood and\n",

      "the entire usefulness of that box, formerly the go-between of a love\n",
      "affair, and the confidant of a love-lorn lawyer, was now limited to the\n",

      "worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the town-hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three or four times a year, Jean Valjean donned his uniform and mounted\n",
      "guard; he did this willingly, however; it was a correct disguise which\n",

      "just attained his sixtieth birthday, the age of legal exemption; but he\n",
      "did not appear to be over fifty; moreover, he had no desire to escape\n",
      "his sergeant-major nor to quibble with Comte de Lobau; he possessed no\n",
      "civil status, he was concealing his name, he was concealing his\n",
      "identity, so he concealed his age, he concealed everything; and, as we\n",

      "Let us note one detail, however; when Jean Valjean went out with\n",

      "night, he was always dressed in a workingman’s trousers and blouse, and\n",
      "wore a cap which concealed his face. Was this precaution or humility?\n",
      "Both. Cosette was accustomed to the enigmatical side of her destiny,\n",
      "and hardly noticed her father’s peculiarities. As for Toussaint, she\n",
      "venerated Jean Valjean, and thought everything he did right.\n",

      "arranged it for love.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was, also, in this solitude, a heart which was quite ready. Love\n",
      "had only to show himself; he had here a temple composed of verdure,\n",
      "grass, moss, the sight of birds, tender shadows, agitated branches, and\n",
      "a soul made of sweetness, of faith, of candor, of hope, of aspiration,\n",
      "and of illusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child; she was\n",
      "a little more than fourteen, and she was at the “ungrateful age”; we\n",
      "have already said, that with the exception of her eyes, she was homely\n",
      "rather than pretty; she had no ungraceful feature, but she was awkward,\n",
      "thin, timid and bold at once, a grown-up little girl, in short.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her education was finished, that is to say, she has been taught\n",

      "participles, the kings of France, a little music, a little drawing,\n",
      "etc.; but in all other respects she was utterly ignorant, which is a\n",

      "left in the dark; later on, mirages that are too abrupt and too lively\n",
      "are formed there, as in a dark chamber. She should be gently and\n",
      "discreetly enlightened, rather with the reflection of realities than\n",
      "with their harsh and direct light. A useful and graciously austere\n",
      "half-light which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls. There is\n",
      "nothing but the maternal instinct, that admirable intuition composed of\n",

      "how this half-light is to be created and of what it should consist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing supplies the place of this instinct. All the nuns in the world\n",

      "Nothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent. The\n",

      "thus thrown back upon itself, works downward within itself, since it\n",
      "cannot overflow, and grows deep, since it cannot expand. Hence visions,\n",
      "suppositions, conjectures, outlines of romances, a desire for\n",

      "\n",
      "On quitting the convent, Cosette could have found nothing more sweet\n",

      "continuation of solitude with the beginning of liberty; a garden that\n",
      "was closed, but a nature that was acrid, rich, voluptuous, and\n",

      "men; a grating, but one that opened on the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, when she arrived there, we repeat, she was only a child. Jean\n",

      "while awaiting the time when she would dream in it; she loved this\n",

      "beloved and charming companion to her. It will be remembered that M.\n",
      "Madeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal. Jean Valjean\n",
      "had continued this practice; he had come to converse well; he possessed\n",
      "the secret riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which has\n",
      "spontaneously cultivated itself. He retained just enough sharpness to\n",
      "season his kindness; his mind was rough and his heart was soft. During\n",
      "their conversations in the Luxembourg, he gave her explanations of\n",
      "everything, drawing on what he had read, and also on what he had\n",
      "suffered. As she listened to him, Cosette’s eyes wandered vaguely\n",
      "about.\n",
      "\n",
      "This simple man sufficed for Cosette’s thought, the same as the wild\n",

      "\n",
      "Cosette adored the goodman. She was always at his heels. Where Jean\n",
      "Valjean was, there happiness was. Jean Valjean lived neither in the\n",
      "pavilion nor the garden; she took greater pleasure in the paved back\n",
      "courtyard, than in the enclosure filled with flowers, and in his little\n",
      "lodge furnished with straw-seated chairs than in the great drawing-room\n",
      "hung with tapestry, against which stood tufted easy-chairs. Jean\n",

      "She remembered that she had gone “one day, at night,” to fetch water in\n",

      "to her that she had begun to live in an abyss, and that it was Jean\n",

      "the effect of a time when there had been nothing around her but\n",
      "millepeds, spiders, and serpents. When she meditated in the evening,\n",
      "before falling asleep, as she had not a very clear idea that she was\n",
      "Jean Valjean’s daughter, and that he was her father, she fancied that\n",
      "the soul of her mother had passed into that good man and had come to\n",
      "dwell near her.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was seated, she leaned her cheek against his white hair, and\n",
      "dropped a silent tear, saying to herself: “Perhaps this man is my\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette, although this is a strange statement to make, in the profound\n",
      "ignorance of a girl brought up in a convent,—maternity being also\n",
      "absolutely unintelligible to virginity,—had ended by fancying that she\n",
      "had had as little mother as possible. She did not even know her\n",
      "mother’s name. Whenever she asked Jean Valjean, Jean Valjean remained\n",
      "silent. If she repeated her question, he responded with a smile. Once\n",
      "she insisted; the smile ended in a tear.\n",
      "\n",
      "This silence on the part of Jean Valjean covered Fantine with darkness.\n",

      "Was it prudence? Was it respect? Was it a fear that he should deliver\n",
      "this name to the hazards of another memory than his own?\n",
      "\n",
      "So long as Cosette had been small, Jean Valjean had been willing to\n",
      "talk to her of her mother; when she became a young girl, it was\n",
      "impossible for him to do so. It seemed to him that he no longer dared.\n",
      "Was it because of Cosette? Was it because of Fantine? He felt a certain\n",
      "religious horror at letting that shadow enter Cosette’s thought; and of\n",
      "placing a third in their destiny. The more sacred this shade was to\n",
      "him, the more did it seem that it was to be feared. He thought of\n",
      "Fantine, and felt himself overwhelmed with silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the darkness, he vaguely perceived something which appeared to\n",
      "have its finger on its lips. Had all the modesty which had been in\n",
      "Fantine, and which had violently quitted her during her lifetime,\n",
      "returned to rest upon her after her death, to watch in indignation over\n",
      "the peace of that dead woman, and in its shyness, to keep her in her\n",
      "grave? Was Jean Valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure? We\n",
      "who believe in death, are not among the number who will reject this\n",

      "\n",
      "Hence the impossibility of uttering, even for Cosette, that name of\n",

      "in that belief with the easy resignation of childhood. And here, all at\n",
      "once, was her mirror saying to her, as Jean Valjean had said: “No\n",

      "preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful, but it made her\n",
      "very sad not to be able to believe in it any longer. She did not look\n",

      "In the evening, after dinner, she generally embroidered in wool or did\n",

      "Moreover, from the mere inspection of Cosette’s toilet, a woman would\n",
      "have recognized the fact that she had no mother. Certain little\n",

      "Cosette, in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful, lost the\n",

      "and innocent creature who walks along, holding in her hand the key to\n",
      "paradise without being conscious of it. But what she had lost in\n",
      "ingenuous grace, she gained in pensive and serious charm. Her whole\n",

      "\n",
      "He caused her the same good and the same evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time, and she had\n",
      "scrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see, while looking elsewhere.\n",
      "Marius still considered Cosette ugly, when she had already begun to\n",

      "\n",
      "Still, she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had\n",

      "voice when she heard him conversing with his comrades, that he held\n",
      "himself badly when he walked, if you like, but with a grace that was\n",
      "all his own, that he did not appear to be at all stupid, that his whole\n",
      "person was noble, gentle, simple, proud, and that, in short, though he\n",
      "seemed to be poor, yet his air was fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the day when their eyes met at last, and said to each other those\n",
      "first, obscure, and ineffable things which the glance lisps, Cosette\n",
      "did not immediately understand. She returned thoughtfully to the house\n",
      "in the Rue de l’Ouest, where Jean Valjean, according to his custom, had\n",
      "come to spend six weeks. The next morning, on waking, she thought of\n",

      "pay attention to her, and it did not appear to her that this attention\n",
      "was the least in the world agreeable to her. She was, on the contrary,\n",
      "somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual. A\n",
      "substratum of war stirred within her. It struck her, and the idea\n",
      "caused her a wholly childish joy, that she was going to take her\n",
      "revenge at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing that she was beautiful, she was thoroughly conscious, though in\n",
      "an indistinct fashion, that she possessed a weapon. Women play with\n",
      "their beauty as children do with a knife. They wound themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reader will recall Marius’ hesitations, his palpitations, his\n",
      "terrors. He remained on his bench and did not approach. This vexed\n",
      "Cosette. One day, she said to Jean Valjean: “Father, let us stroll\n",
      "about a little in that direction.” Seeing that Marius did not come to\n",
      "her, she went to him. In such cases, all women resemble Mahomet. And\n",
      "then, strange to say, the first symptom of true love in a young man is\n",
      "timidity; in a young girl it is boldness. This is surprising, and yet\n",
      "nothing is more simple. It is the two sexes tending to approach each\n",
      "other and assuming, each the other’s qualities.\n",
      "\n",
      "That day, Cosette’s glance drove Marius beside himself, and Marius’\n",

      "Cosette uneasy. From that day forth, they adored each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing that Cosette felt was a confused and profound\n",
      "melancholy. It seemed to her that her soul had become black since the\n",
      "day before. She no longer recognized it. The whiteness of soul in young\n",
      "girls, which is composed of coldness and gayety, resembles snow. It\n",
      "melts in love, which is its sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette did not know what love was. She had never heard the word\n",
      "uttered in its terrestrial sense. On the books of profane music which\n",
      "entered the convent, _amour_ (love) was replaced by _tambour_ (drum) or\n",
      "_pandour_. This created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the\n",
      "_big girls_, such as: _Ah, how delightful is the drum! _ or, _Pity is\n",
      "not a pandour_. But Cosette had left the convent too early to have\n",
      "occupied herself much with the “drum.” Therefore, she did not know what\n",

      "does not know the name of one’s malady?\n",
      "\n",
      "She loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly. She\n",
      "did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, useful or\n",
      "dangerous, eternal or temporary, allowable or prohibited; she loved.\n",
      "She would have been greatly astonished, had any one said to her: “You\n",

      "bad! You have oppressions and palpitations of the heart? That must not\n",
      "be! You blush and turn pale, when a certain being clad in black appears\n",
      "at the end of a certain green walk? But that is abominable!” She would\n",

      "fears of children and all the fears of nuns combined. The spirit of the\n",
      "convent, with which she had been permeated for the space of five years,\n",
      "was still in the process of slow evaporation from her person, and made\n",
      "everything tremble around her. In this situation he was not a lover, he\n",
      "was not even an admirer, he was a vision. She set herself to adoring\n",
      "Marius as something charming, luminous, and impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "As extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry, she smiled at him\n",
      "with all frankness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every day, she looked forward to the hour for their walk with\n",
      "impatience, she found Marius there, she felt herself unspeakably happy,\n",

      "porter. The porter, on his side, spoke, and said to Jean Valjean:\n",
      "“Monsieur, who is that curious young man who is asking for you?” On the\n",
      "morrow Jean Valjean bestowed on Marius that glance which Marius at last\n",
      "perceived. A week later, Jean Valjean had taken his departure. He swore\n",
      "to himself that he would never again set foot either in the Luxembourg\n",
      "or in the Rue de l’Ouest. He returned to the Rue Plumet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette did not complain, she said nothing, she asked no questions, she\n",
      "did not seek to learn his reasons; she had already reached the point\n",
      "where she was afraid of being divined, and of betraying herself. Jean\n",
      "Valjean had no experience of these miseries, the only miseries which\n",
      "are charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted; the\n",
      "consequence was that he did not understand the grave significance of\n",
      "Cosette’s silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "He merely noticed that she had grown sad, and he grew gloomy. On his\n",
      "side and on hers, inexperience had joined issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once he made a trial. He asked Cosette:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you like to come to the Luxembourg?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A ray illuminated Cosette’s pale face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went thither. Three months had elapsed. Marius no longer went\n",
      "there. Marius was not there.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the following day, Jean Valjean asked Cosette again:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you like to come to the Luxembourg?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She replied, sadly and gently:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean was hurt by this sadness, and heart-broken at this\n",
      "gentleness.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so\n",
      "impenetrable? What was on its way there within? What was taking place\n",
      "in Cosette’s soul? Sometimes, instead of going to bed, Jean Valjean\n",
      "remained seated on his pallet, with his head in his hands, and he\n",
      "passed whole nights asking himself: “What has Cosette in her mind?” and\n",
      "in thinking of the things that she might be thinking about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! at such moments, what mournful glances did he cast towards that\n",
      "cloister, that chaste peak, that abode of angels, that inaccessible\n",
      "glacier of virtue! How he contemplated, with despairing ecstasy, that\n",
      "convent garden, full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins, where\n",
      "all perfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven! How he adored that\n",
      "Eden forever closed against him, whence he had voluntarily and madly\n",
      "emerged! How he regretted his abnegation and his folly in having\n",
      "brought Cosette back into the world, poor hero of sacrifice, seized and\n",
      "hurled to the earth by his very self-devotion! How he said to himself,\n",
      "“What have I done?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, nothing of all this was perceptible to Cosette. No ill-temper,\n",
      "no harshness. His face was always serene and kind. Jean Valjean’s\n",
      "manners were more tender and more paternal than ever. If anything could\n",
      "have betrayed his lack of joy, it was his increased suavity.\n",
      "\n",
      "On her side, Cosette languished. She suffered from the absence of\n",
      "Marius as she had rejoiced in his presence, peculiarly, without exactly\n",
      "being conscious of it. When Jean Valjean ceased to take her on their\n",
      "customary strolls, a feminine instinct murmured confusedly, at the\n",
      "bottom of her heart, that she must not seem to set store on the\n",
      "Luxembourg garden, and that if this proved to be a matter of\n",
      "indifference to her, her father would take her thither once more. But\n",
      "days, weeks, months, elapsed. Jean Valjean had tacitly accepted\n",
      "Cosette’s tacit consent. She regretted it. It was too late. So Marius\n",
      "had disappeared; all was over. The day on which she returned to the\n",
      "Luxembourg, Marius was no longer there. What was to be done? Should she\n",
      "ever find him again? She felt an anguish at her heart, which nothing\n",
      "relieved, and which augmented every day; she no longer knew whether it\n",
      "was winter or summer, whether it was raining or shining, whether the\n",
      "birds were singing, whether it was the season for dahlias or daisies,\n",
      "whether the Luxembourg was more charming than the Tuileries, whether\n",
      "the linen which the laundress brought home was starched too much or not\n",
      "enough, whether Toussaint had done “her marketing” well or ill; and she\n",
      "remained dejected, absorbed, attentive to but a single thought, her\n",
      "eyes vague and staring as when one gazes by night at a black and\n",
      "fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, she did not allow Jean Valjean to perceive anything of this,\n",
      "except her pallor.\n",
      "\n",
      "She still wore her sweet face for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pallor sufficed but too thoroughly to trouble Jean Valjean.\n",
      "Sometimes he asked her:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter with you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She replied: “There is nothing the matter with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And after a silence, when she divined that he was sad also, she would\n",
      "add:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you, father—is there anything wrong with you?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean was the more unhappy of the two. Youth, even in its\n",
      "sorrows, always possesses its own peculiar radiance.\n",
      "\n",
      "At times, Jean Valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile. It\n",
      "is the property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear.\n",
      "He had an unconquerable conviction that Cosette was escaping from him.\n",
      "He would have liked to resist, to retain her, to arouse her enthusiasm\n",
      "by some external and brilliant matter. These ideas, puerile, as we have\n",
      "just said, and at the same time senile, conveyed to him, by their very\n",
      "childishness, a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on\n",
      "the imaginations of young girls. He once chanced to see a general on\n",
      "horseback, in full uniform, pass along the street, Comte Coutard, the\n",
      "commandant of Paris. He envied that gilded man; what happiness it would\n",
      "be, he said to himself, if he could put on that suit which was an\n",
      "incontestable thing; and if Cosette could behold him thus, she would be\n",
      "dazzled, and when he had Cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the\n",
      "Tuileries, the guard would present arms to him, and that would suffice\n",
      "for Cosette, and would dispel her idea of looking at young men.\n",
      "\n",
      "An unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the isolated life which they led, and since they had come to dwell\n",
      "in the Rue Plumet, they had contracted one habit. They sometimes took a\n",
      "pleasure trip to see the sun rise, a mild species of enjoyment which\n",
      "befits those who are entering life and those who are quitting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those who love solitude, a walk in the early morning is equivalent\n",
      "to a stroll by night, with the cheerfulness of nature added. The\n",
      "streets are deserted and the birds are singing. Cosette, a bird\n",
      "herself, liked to rise early. These matutinal excursions were planned\n",
      "on the preceding evening. He proposed, and she agreed. It was arranged\n",
      "like a plot, they set out before daybreak, and these trips were so many\n",
      "small delights for Cosette. These innocent eccentricities please young\n",
      "people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean’s inclination led him, as we have seen, to the least\n",
      "frequented spots, to solitary nooks, to forgotten places. There then\n",
      "existed, in the vicinity of the barriers of Paris, a sort of poor\n",
      "meadows, which were almost confounded with the city, where grew in\n",
      "summer sickly grain, and which, in autumn, after the harvest had been\n",
      "gathered, presented the appearance, not of having been reaped, but\n",
      "peeled. Jean Valjean loved to haunt these fields. Cosette was not bored\n",
      "there. It meant solitude to him and liberty to her. There, she became a\n",
      "little girl once more, she could run and almost play; she took off her\n",
      "hat, laid it on Jean Valjean’s knees, and gathered bunches of flowers.\n",
      "She gazed at the butterflies on the flowers, but did not catch them;\n",
      "gentleness and tenderness are born with love, and the young girl who\n",
      "cherishes within her breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on\n",
      "the wing of a butterfly. She wove garlands of poppies, which she placed\n",
      "on her head, and which, crossed and penetrated with sunlight, glowing\n",
      "until they flamed, formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after their life had grown sad, they kept up their custom of early\n",
      "strolls.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning in October, therefore, tempted by the serene perfection of\n",
      "the autumn of 1831, they set out, and found themselves at break of day\n",
      "near the Barrière du Maine. It was not dawn, it was daybreak; a\n",
      "delightful and stern moment. A few constellations here and there in the\n",
      "deep, pale azure, the earth all black, the heavens all white, a quiver\n",
      "amid the blades of grass, everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight.\n",
      "A lark, which seemed mingled with the stars, was carolling at a\n",
      "prodigious height, and one would have declared that that hymn of\n",
      "pettiness calmed immensity. In the East, the Val-de-Grâce projected its\n",
      "dark mass on the clear horizon with the sharpness of steel; Venus\n",
      "dazzlingly brilliant was rising behind that dome and had the air of a\n",
      "soul making its escape from a gloomy edifice.\n",
      "\n",
      "All was peace and silence; there was no one on the road; a few stray\n",
      "laborers, of whom they caught barely a glimpse, were on their way to\n",
      "their work along the side-paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean was sitting in a cross-walk on some planks deposited at\n",
      "the gate of a timber-yard. His face was turned towards the highway, his\n",
      "back towards the light; he had forgotten the sun which was on the point\n",
      "of rising; he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which\n",
      "the mind becomes concentrated, which imprison even the eye, and which\n",
      "are equivalent to four walls. There are meditations which may be called\n",
      "vertical; when one is at the bottom of them, time is required to return\n",
      "to earth. Jean Valjean had plunged into one of these reveries. He was\n",
      "thinking of Cosette, of the happiness that was possible if nothing came\n",
      "between him and her, of the light with which she filled his life, a\n",
      "light which was but the emanation of her soul. He was almost happy in\n",
      "his reverie. Cosette, who was standing beside him, was gazing at the\n",
      "clouds as they turned rosy.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once Cosette exclaimed: “Father, I should think some one was\n",
      "coming yonder.” Jean Valjean raised his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette was right. The causeway which leads to the ancient Barrière du\n",
      "Maine is a prolongation, as the reader knows, of the Rue de Sèvres, and\n",
      "is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard. At the elbow of the\n",
      "causeway and the boulevard, at the spot where it branches, they heard a\n",
      "noise which it was difficult to account for at that hour, and a sort of\n",
      "confused pile made its appearance. Some shapeless thing which was\n",
      "coming from the boulevard was turning into the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "It grew larger, it seemed to move in an orderly manner, though it was\n",
      "bristling and quivering; it seemed to be a vehicle, but its load could\n",
      "not be distinctly made out. There were horses, wheels, shouts; whips\n",
      "were cracking. By degrees the outlines became fixed, although bathed in\n",
      "shadows. It was a vehicle, in fact, which had just turned from the\n",
      "boulevard into the highway, and which was directing its course towards\n",
      "the barrier near which sat Jean Valjean; a second, of the same aspect,\n",
      "followed, then a third, then a fourth; seven chariots made their\n",
      "appearance in succession, the heads of the horses touching the rear of\n",
      "the wagon in front. Figures were moving on these vehicles, flashes were\n",
      "visible through the dusk as though there were naked swords there, a\n",
      "clanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains, and as\n",
      "this something advanced, the sound of voices waxed louder, and it\n",
      "turned into a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it drew nearer, it assumed a form, and was outlined behind the trees\n",
      "with the pallid hue of an apparition; the mass grew white; the day,\n",
      "which was slowly dawning, cast a wan light on this swarming heap which\n",
      "was at once both sepulchral and living, the heads of the figures turned\n",
      "into the faces of corpses, and this is what it proved to be:—\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven wagons were driving in a file along the road. The first six were\n",
      "singularly constructed. They resembled coopers’ drays; they consisted\n",
      "of long ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear\n",
      "extremities. Each dray, or rather let us say, each ladder, was attached\n",
      "to four horses harnessed tandem. On these ladders strange clusters of\n",
      "men were being drawn. In the faint light, these men were to be divined\n",
      "rather than seen. Twenty-four on each vehicle, twelve on a side, back\n",
      "to back, facing the passers-by, their legs dangling in the air,—this\n",
      "was the manner in which these men were travelling, and behind their\n",
      "backs they had something which clanked, and which was a chain, and on\n",
      "their necks something which shone, and which was an iron collar. Each\n",
      "man had his collar, but the chain was for all; so that if these four\n",
      "and twenty men had occasion to alight from the dray and walk, they were\n",
      "seized with a sort of inexorable unity, and were obliged to wind over\n",
      "the ground with the chain for a backbone, somewhat after the fashion of\n",
      "millepeds. In the back and front of each vehicle, two men armed with\n",
      "muskets stood erect, each holding one end of the chain under his foot.\n",
      "The iron necklets were square. The seventh vehicle, a huge rack-sided\n",
      "baggage wagon, without a hood, had four wheels and six horses, and\n",
      "carried a sonorous pile of iron boilers, cast-iron pots, braziers, and\n",
      "chains, among which were mingled several men who were pinioned and\n",
      "stretched at full length, and who seemed to be ill. This wagon, all\n",
      "lattice-work, was garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared to\n",
      "have served for former punishments. These vehicles kept to the middle\n",
      "of the road. On each side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous\n",
      "aspect, wearing three-cornered hats, like the soldiers under the\n",
      "Directory, shabby, covered with spots and holes, muffled in uniforms of\n",
      "veterans and the trousers of undertakers’ men, half gray, half blue,\n",
      "which were almost hanging in rags, with red epaulets, yellow shoulder\n",
      "belts, short sabres, muskets, and cudgels; they were a species of\n",
      "soldier-blackguards. These myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness\n",
      "of the beggar and the authority of the executioner. The one who\n",
      "appeared to be their chief held a postilion’s whip in his hand. All\n",
      "these details, blurred by the dimness of dawn, became more and more\n",
      "clearly outlined as the light increased. At the head and in the rear of\n",
      "the convoy rode mounted gendarmes, serious and with sword in fist.\n",
      "\n",
      "This procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the\n",
      "barrier, the last was barely debauching from the boulevard. A throng,\n",
      "sprung, it is impossible to say whence, and formed in a twinkling, as\n",
      "is frequently the case in Paris, pressed forward from both sides of the\n",
      "road and looked on. In the neighboring lanes the shouts of people\n",
      "calling to each other and the wooden shoes of market-gardeners\n",
      "hastening up to gaze were audible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along in\n",
      "silence. They were livid with the chill of morning. They all wore linen\n",
      "trousers, and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes. The rest\n",
      "of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness. Their accoutrements\n",
      "were horribly incongruous; nothing is more funereal than the harlequin\n",
      "in rags. Battered felt hats, tarpaulin caps, hideous woollen nightcaps,\n",
      "and, side by side with a short blouse, a black coat broken at the\n",
      "elbow; many wore women’s headgear, others had baskets on their heads;\n",
      "hairy breasts were visible, and through the rent in their garments\n",
      "tattooed designs could be descried; temples of Love, flaming hearts,\n",
      "Cupids; eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen. Two or\n",
      "three had a straw rope attached to the cross-bar of the dray, and\n",
      "suspended under them like a stirrup, which supported their feet. One of\n",
      "them held in his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the\n",
      "appearance of a black stone and which he seemed to be gnawing; it was\n",
      "bread which he was eating. There were no eyes there which were not\n",
      "either dry, dulled, or flaming with an evil light. The escort troop\n",
      "cursed, the men in chains did not utter a syllable; from time to time\n",
      "the sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on\n",
      "shoulder-blades or skulls; some of these men were yawning; their rags\n",
      "were terrible; their feet hung down, their shoulders oscillated, their\n",
      "heads clashed together, their fetters clanked, their eyes glared\n",
      "ferociously, their fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands\n",
      "of corpses; in the rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming\n",
      "with laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "This file of vehicles, whatever its nature was, was mournful. It was\n",
      "evident that to-morrow, that an hour hence, a pouring rain might\n",
      "descend, that it might be followed by another and another, and that\n",
      "their dilapidated garments would be drenched, that once soaked, these\n",
      "men would not get dry again, that once chilled, they would not again\n",
      "get warm, that their linen trousers would be glued to their bones by\n",
      "the downpour, that the water would fill their shoes, that no lashes\n",
      "from the whips would be able to prevent their jaws from chattering,\n",
      "that the chain would continue to bind them by the neck, that their legs\n",
      "would continue to dangle, and it was impossible not to shudder at the\n",
      "sight of these human beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold\n",
      "clouds of autumn, and delivered over to the rain, to the blast, to all\n",
      "the furies of the air, like trees and stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of the sick\n",
      "men, who lay there knotted with ropes and motionless on the seventh\n",
      "wagon, and who appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled\n",
      "with misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, the sun made its appearance; the immense light of the Orient\n",
      "burst forth, and one would have said that it had set fire to all those\n",
      "ferocious heads. Their tongues were unloosed; a conflagration of grins,\n",
      "oaths, and songs exploded. The broad horizontal sheet of light severed\n",
      "the file in two parts, illuminating heads and bodies, leaving feet and\n",
      "wheels in the obscurity. Thoughts made their appearance on these faces;\n",
      "it was a terrible moment; visible demons with their masks removed,\n",
      "fierce souls laid bare. Though lighted up, this wild throng remained in\n",
      "gloom. Some, who were gay, had in their mouths quills through which\n",
      "they blew vermin over the crowd, picking out the women; the dawn\n",
      "accentuated these lamentable profiles with the blackness of its\n",
      "shadows; there was not one of these creatures who was not deformed by\n",
      "reason of wretchedness; and the whole was so monstrous that one would\n",
      "have said that the sun’s brilliancy had been changed into the glare of\n",
      "the lightning. The wagon-load which headed the line had struck up a\n",
      "song, and were shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard\n",
      "joviality, a pot-pourri by Desaugiers, then famous, called _The\n",
      "Vestal_; the trees shivered mournfully; in the cross-lanes,\n",
      "countenances of bourgeois listened in an idiotic delight to these\n",
      "coarse strains droned by spectres.\n",
      "\n",
      "All sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos; here were to\n",
      "be found the facial angles of every sort of beast, old men, youths,\n",
      "bald heads, gray beards, cynical monstrosities, sour resignation,\n",
      "savage grins, senseless attitudes, snouts surmounted by caps, heads\n",
      "like those of young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples,\n",
      "infantile visages, and by reason of that, horrible thin skeleton faces,\n",
      "to which death alone was lacking. On the first cart was a negro, who\n",

      "were suffered by all in their extremest depths, and ignorance,\n",
      "converted into dulness, was the equal of intelligence converted into\n",

      "them. These beings had been fettered and coupled pell-mell, in\n",
      "alphabetical disorder, probably, and loaded hap-hazard on those carts.\n",
      "Nevertheless, horrors, when grouped together, always end by evolving a\n",
      "result; all additions of wretched men give a sum total, each chain\n",
      "exhaled a common soul, and each dray-load had its own physiognomy. By\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the guards, who had a hook on the end of his cudgel, made a\n",
      "pretence from time to time, of stirring up this mass of human filth. An\n",

      "reality, and in which flames the reflection of terrors and of\n",
      "catastrophes. He was not looking at a spectacle, he was seeing a\n",

      "move his feet. Sometimes, the things that you see seize upon you and\n",
      "hold you fast. He remained nailed to the spot, petrified, stupid,\n",
      "asking himself, athwart confused and inexpressible anguish, what this\n",
      "sepulchral persecution signified, and whence had come that pandemonium\n",
      "which was pursuing him. All at once, he raised his hand to his brow, a\n",
      "gesture habitual to those whose memory suddenly returns; he remembered\n",
      "that this was, in fact, the usual itinerary, that it was customary to\n",
      "make this detour in order to avoid all possibility of encountering\n",
      "royalty on the road to Fontainebleau, and that, five and thirty years\n",
      "before, he had himself passed through that barrier.\n",

      "Cosette was no less terrified, but in a different way. She did not\n",

      "a perfect storm of whips and clubs; the convicts bent before it, a\n",
      "hideous obedience was evoked by the torture, and all held their peace,\n",
      "darting glances like chained wolves.\n",
      "\n",

      "Bicêtre, and had taken the road to Mans in order to avoid\n",
      "Fontainebleau, where the King then was. This caused the horrible\n",
      "journey to last three or four days longer; but torture may surely be\n",
      "prolonged with the object of sparing the royal personage a sight of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed. Such encounters are\n",
      "shocks, and the memory that they leave behind them resembles a thorough\n",

      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, Jean Valjean did not observe that, on his way back to the\n",
      "Rue de Babylone with Cosette, the latter was plying him with other\n",
      "questions on the subject of what they had just seen; perhaps he was too\n",
      "much absorbed in his own dejection to notice her words and reply to\n",
      "them. But when Cosette was leaving him in the evening, to betake\n",
      "herself to bed, he heard her say in a low voice, and as though talking\n",
      "to herself: “It seems to me, that if I were to find one of those men in\n",
      "my pathway, oh, my God, I should die merely from the sight of him close\n",

      "performances in the Champs-Élysées, fireworks at the Arc de l’Étoile,\n",
      "illuminations everywhere. Jean Valjean did violence to his habits, and\n",
      "took Cosette to see these rejoicings, for the purpose of diverting her\n",
      "from the memory of the day before, and of effacing, beneath the smiling\n",
      "tumult of all Paris, the abominable thing which had passed before her.\n",
      "The review with which the festival was spiced made the presence of\n",
      "uniforms perfectly natural; Jean Valjean donned his uniform of a\n",
      "national guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking\n",
      "himself to shelter. However, this trip seemed to attain its object.\n",
      "Cosette, who made it her law to please her father, and to whom,\n",
      "moreover, all spectacles were a novelty, accepted this diversion with\n",
      "the light and easy good grace of youth, and did not pout too\n",
      "disdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public fête; so that\n",
      "Jean Valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded, and that no\n",

      "Some days later, one morning, when the sun was shining brightly, and\n",
      "they were both on the steps leading to the garden, another infraction\n",
      "of the rules which Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself,\n",
      "and to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had\n",
      "caused Cosette to adopt, Cosette, in a wrapper, was standing erect in\n",
      "that negligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an\n",

      "a little, passionately, etc_.—who was there who could have taught her?\n",
      "She was handling the flower instinctively, innocently, without a\n",
      "suspicion that to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart. If\n",
      "there were a fourth, and smiling Grace called Melancholy, she would\n",

      "But one diversion, which had formerly been a happiness, remained to\n",

      "One evening, little Gavroche had had nothing to eat; he remembered that\n",
      "he had not dined on the preceding day either; this was becoming\n",
      "tiresome. He resolved to make an effort to secure some supper. He\n",
      "strolled out beyond the Salpêtrière into deserted regions; that is\n",
      "where windfalls are to be found; where there is no one, one always\n",

      "the village of Austerlitz.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden\n",
      "haunted by an old man and an old woman, and in that garden, a passable\n",
      "apple-tree. Beside the apple-tree stood a sort of fruit-house, which\n",
      "was not securely fastened, and where one might contrive to get an\n",
      "apple. One apple is a supper; one apple is life. That which was Adam’s\n",
      "ruin might prove Gavroche’s salvation. The garden abutted on a\n",
      "solitary, unpaved lane, bordered with brushwood while awaiting the\n",
      "arrival of houses; the garden was separated from it by a hedge.\n",

      "Gavroche directed his steps towards this garden; he found the lane, he\n",
      "recognized the apple-tree, he verified the fruit-house, he examined the\n",
      "hedge; a hedge means merely one stride. The day was declining, there\n",
      "was not even a cat in the lane, the hour was propitious. Gavroche began\n",
      "the operation of scaling the hedge, then suddenly paused. Some one was\n",

      "of the first; but in the voluntary slowness of its gait, suppleness and\n",
      "agility were discernible. This figure had also something fierce and\n",
      "disquieting about it, the whole shape was that of what was then called\n",
      "_an elegant_; the hat was of good shape, the coat black, well cut,\n",

      "it was Montparnasse.\n",

      "\n",
      "Montparnasse on the hunt at such an hour, in such a place, betokened\n",
      "something threatening. Gavroche felt his gamin’s heart moved with\n",
      "compassion for the old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was he to do? Interfere? One weakness coming to the aid of\n",
      "another! It would be merely a laughing matter for Montparnasse.\n",
      "Gavroche did not shut his eyes to the fact that the old man, in the\n",
      "first place, and the child in the second, would make but two mouthfuls\n",
      "for that redoubtable ruffian eighteen years of age.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Gavroche was deliberating, the attack took place, abruptly and\n",
      "hideously. The attack of the tiger on the wild ass, the attack of the\n",
      "spider on the fly. Montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose, bounded\n",
      "upon the old man, seized him by the collar, grasped and clung to him,\n",
      "and Gavroche with difficulty restrained a scream. A moment later one of\n",
      "these men was underneath the other, groaning, struggling, with a knee\n",
      "of marble upon his breast. Only, it was not just what Gavroche had\n",
      "expected. The one who lay on the earth was Montparnasse; the one who\n",
      "was on top was the old man. All this took place a few paces distant\n",
      "from Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man had received the shock, had returned it, and that in such a\n",
      "terrible fashion, that in a twinkling, the assailant and the assailed\n",
      "had exchanged rôles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here’s a hearty veteran!” thought Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not refrain from clapping his hands. But it was applause\n",
      "wasted. It did not reach the combatants, absorbed and deafened as they\n",
      "were, each by the other, as their breath mingled in the struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Silence ensued. Montparnasse ceased his struggles. Gavroche indulged in\n",
      "this aside: “Can he be dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The goodman had not uttered a word, nor given vent to a cry. He rose to\n",

      "\n",
      "“Get up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Montparnasse rose, but the goodman held him fast. Montparnasse’s\n",
      "attitude was the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who has\n",
      "been caught by a sheep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche looked on and listened, making an effort to reinforce his eyes\n",
      "with his ears. He was enjoying himself immensely.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was repaid for his conscientious anxiety in the character of a\n",
      "spectator. He was able to catch on the wing a dialogue which borrowed\n",
      "from the darkness an indescribably tragic accent. The goodman\n",

      "\n",

      "A pause ensued. The old man seemed absorbed in profound thought. He\n",
      "stood motionless, and did not relax his hold on Montparnasse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every moment the vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in the\n",
      "twitchings of a wild beast caught in a snare. He gave a jerk, tried a\n",

      "escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man did not appear to notice it, and held both his arms with\n",
      "one hand, with the sovereign indifference of absolute force.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man’s reverie lasted for some time, then, looking steadily at\n",
      "Montparnasse, he addressed to him in a gentle voice, in the midst of\n",
      "the darkness where they stood, a solemn harangue, of which Gavroche did\n",
      "not lose a single syllable:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“My child, you are entering, through indolence, on one of the most\n",
      "laborious of lives. Ah! You declare yourself to be an idler! prepare to\n",
      "toil. There is a certain formidable machine, have you seen it? It is\n",
      "the rolling-mill. You must be on your guard against it, it is crafty\n",
      "and ferocious; if it catches hold of the skirt of your coat, you will\n",
      "be drawn in bodily. That machine is laziness. Stop while there is yet\n",
      "time, and save yourself! Otherwise, it is all over with you; in a short\n",
      "time you will be among the gearing. Once entangled, hope for nothing\n",
      "more. Toil, lazybones! there is no more repose for you! The iron hand\n",
      "of implacable toil has seized you. You do not wish to earn your living,\n",
      "to have a task, to fulfil a duty! It bores you to be like other men?\n",
      "Well! You will be different. Labor is the law; he who rejects it will\n",
      "find ennui his torment. You do not wish to be a workingman, you will be\n",
      "a slave. Toil lets go of you on one side only to grasp you again on the\n",
      "other. You do not desire to be its friend, you shall be its negro\n",
      "slave. Ah! You would have none of the honest weariness of men, you\n",
      "shall have the sweat of the damned. Where others sing, you will rattle\n",
      "in your throat. You will see afar off, from below, other men at work;\n",
      "it will seem to you that they are resting. The laborer, the harvester,\n",
      "the sailor, the blacksmith, will appear to you in glory like the\n",
      "blessed spirits in paradise. What radiance surrounds the forge! To\n",
      "guide the plough, to bind the sheaves, is joy. The bark at liberty in\n",
      "the wind, what delight! Do you, lazy idler, delve, drag on, roll,\n",
      "march! Drag your halter. You are a beast of burden in the team of hell!\n",
      "Ah! To do nothing is your object. Well, not a week, not a day, not an\n",
      "hour shall you have free from oppression. You will be able to lift\n",
      "nothing without anguish. Every minute that passes will make your\n",
      "muscles crack. What is a feather to others will be a rock to you. The\n",
      "simplest things will become steep acclivities. Life will become\n",
      "monstrous all about you. To go, to come, to breathe, will be just so\n",
      "many terrible labors. Your lungs will produce on you the effect of\n",
      "weighing a hundred pounds. Whether you shall walk here rather than\n",
      "there, will become a problem that must be solved. Any one who wants to\n",
      "go out simply gives his door a push, and there he is in the open air.\n",
      "If you wish to go out, you will be obliged to pierce your wall. What\n",
      "does every one who wants to step into the street do? He goes\n",
      "downstairs; you will tear up your sheets, little by little you will\n",
      "make of them a rope, then you will climb out of your window, and you\n",
      "will suspend yourself by that thread over an abyss, and it will be\n",
      "night, amid storm, rain, and the hurricane, and if the rope is too\n",
      "short, but one way of descending will remain to you, to fall. To drop\n",
      "hap-hazard into the gulf, from an unknown height, on what? On what is\n",
      "beneath, on the unknown. Or you will crawl up a chimney-flue, at the\n",
      "risk of burning; or you will creep through a sewer-pipe, at the risk of\n",
      "drowning; I do not speak of the holes that you will be obliged to mask,\n",
      "of the stones which you will have to take up and replace twenty times a\n",
      "day, of the plaster that you will have to hide in your straw pallet. A\n",
      "lock presents itself; the bourgeois has in his pocket a key made by a\n",
      "locksmith. If you wish to pass out, you will be condemned to execute a\n",
      "terrible work of art; you will take a large sou, you will cut it in two\n",
      "plates; with what tools? You will have to invent them. That is your\n",
      "business. Then you will hollow out the interior of these plates, taking\n",
      "great care of the outside, and you will make on the edges a thread, so\n",
      "that they can be adjusted one upon the other like a box and its cover.\n",
      "The top and bottom thus screwed together, nothing will be suspected. To\n",
      "the overseers it will be only a sou; to you it will be a box. What will\n",
      "you put in this box? A small bit of steel. A watch-spring, in which you\n",
      "will have cut teeth, and which will form a saw. With this saw, as long\n",
      "as a pin, and concealed in a sou, you will cut the bolt of the lock,\n",
      "you will sever bolts, the padlock of your chain, and the bar at your\n",
      "window, and the fetter on your leg. This masterpiece finished, this\n",
      "prodigy accomplished, all these miracles of art, address, skill, and\n",
      "patience executed, what will be your recompense if it becomes known\n",
      "that you are the author? The dungeon. There is your future. What\n",
      "precipices are idleness and pleasure! Do you know that to do nothing is\n",
      "a melancholy resolution? To live in idleness on the property of\n",
      "society! to be useless, that is to say, pernicious! This leads straight\n",
      "to the depth of wretchedness. Woe to the man who desires to be a\n",
      "parasite! He will become vermin! Ah! So it does not please you to work?\n",
      "Ah! You have but one thought, to drink well, to eat well, to sleep\n",
      "well. You will drink water, you will eat black bread, you will sleep on\n",
      "a plank with a fetter whose cold touch you will feel on your flesh all\n",
      "night long, riveted to your limbs. You will break those fetters, you\n",
      "will flee. That is well. You will crawl on your belly through the\n",
      "brushwood, and you will eat grass like the beasts of the forest. And\n",
      "you will be recaptured. And then you will pass years in a dungeon,\n",
      "riveted to a wall, groping for your jug that you may drink, gnawing at\n",
      "a horrible loaf of darkness which dogs would not touch, eating beans\n",
      "that the worms have eaten before you. You will be a wood-louse in a\n",

      "sucking at nurse less than twenty years ago, and who have, no doubt, a\n",
      "mother still alive! I conjure you, listen to me, I entreat you. You\n",
      "desire fine black cloth, varnished shoes, to have your hair curled and\n",
      "sweet-smelling oils on your locks, to please low women, to be handsome.\n",
      "You will be shaven clean, and you will wear a red blouse and wooden\n",
      "shoes. You want rings on your fingers, you will have an iron necklet on\n",
      "your neck. If you glance at a woman, you will receive a blow. And you\n",
      "will enter there at the age of twenty. And you will come out at fifty!\n",
      "You will enter young, rosy, fresh, with brilliant eyes, and all your\n",
      "white teeth, and your handsome, youthful hair; you will come out\n",
      "broken, bent, wrinkled, toothless, horrible, with white locks! Ah! my\n",
      "poor child, you are on the wrong road; idleness is counselling you\n",
      "badly; the hardest of all work is thieving. Believe me, do not\n",
      "undertake that painful profession of an idle man. It is not comfortable\n",
      "to become a rascal. It is less disagreeable to be an honest man. Now\n",

      "his hand into the back pocket of that frock-coat of fine black cloth,\n",
      "seized the purse, withdrew his hand, and having recourse once more to\n",

      "Montparnasse, who had no reason to be on his guard, and who was engaged\n",
      "in thought for the first time in his life, perceived nothing. When\n",
      "Gavroche had once more attained the point where Father Mabeuf was, he\n",

      "far as a little blind-alley at the corner of which she read: _Impasse\n",
      "de la Planchette_. There he alighted, and the coach took Cosette back\n",

      "\n",
      "Cosette thought that she had been mistaken. She thought that she had\n",
      "heard a noise. It was a hallucination produced by the melancholy and\n",
      "magnificent chorus of Weber, which lays open before the mind terrified\n",
      "depths, which trembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest, and in\n",
      "which one hears the crackling of dead branches beneath the uneasy tread\n",

      "On the following day, at an earlier hour, towards nightfall, she was\n",
      "strolling in the garden. In the midst of the confused thoughts which\n",
      "occupied her, she fancied that she caught for an instant a sound\n",
      "similar to that of the preceding evening, as though some one were\n",
      "walking beneath the trees in the dusk, and not very far from her; but\n",
      "she told herself that nothing so closely resembles a step on the grass\n",
      "as the friction of two branches which have moved from side to side, and\n",
      "she paid no heed to it. Besides, she could see nothing.\n",

      "had a round hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the shadow of a man, who must have been standing on the border\n",
      "of the clump of shrubbery, a few paces in the rear of Cosette.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stood for a moment without the power to speak, or cry, or call, or\n",
      "stir, or turn her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she summoned up all her courage, and turned round resolutely.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no one there.\n",
      "\n",
      "She glanced on the ground. The figure had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "She re-entered the thicket, searched the corners boldly, went as far as\n",
      "the gate, and found nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt herself absolutely chilled with terror. Was this another\n",
      "hallucination? What! Two days in succession! One hallucination might\n",
      "pass, but two hallucinations? The disquieting point about it was, that\n",
      "the shadow had assuredly not been a phantom. Phantoms do not wear round\n",
      "hats.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the following day Jean Valjean returned. Cosette told him what she\n",

      "He left her under some pretext, and went into the garden, and she saw\n",
      "him examining the gate with great attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the night she woke up; this time she was sure, and she\n",
      "distinctly heard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath\n",
      "her window. She ran to her little wicket and opened it. In point of\n",
      "fact, there was a man in the garden, with a large club in his hand.\n",
      "Just as she was about to scream, the moon lighted up the man’s profile.\n",
      "It was her father. She returned to her bed, saying to herself: “He is\n",

      "\n",

      "On the third night, the moon was on the wane, and had begun to rise\n",
      "later; at one o’clock in the morning, possibly, she heard a loud burst\n",
      "of laughter and her father’s voice calling her:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cosette!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She jumped out of bed, threw on her dressing-gown, and opened her\n",

      "there is your shadow with the round hat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon, and\n",
      "which did indeed, bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a man\n",
      "wearing a round hat. It was the shadow produced by a chimney-pipe of\n",
      "sheet iron, with a hood, which rose above a neighboring roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette joined in his laughter, all her lugubrious suppositions were\n",
      "allayed, and the next morning, as she was at breakfast with her father,\n",
      "she made merry over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of iron\n",
      "chimney-pots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean became quite tranquil once more; as for Cosette, she did\n",
      "not pay much attention to the question whether the chimney-pot was\n",
      "really in the direction of the shadow which she had seen, or thought\n",
      "she had seen, and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the\n",
      "sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a chimney-pot\n",
      "which is afraid of being caught in the act, and which retires when some\n",
      "one looks at its shadow, for the shadow had taken the alarm when\n",
      "Cosette had turned round, and Cosette had thought herself very sure of\n",
      "this. Cosette’s serenity was fully restored. The proof appeared to her\n",
      "to be complete, and it quite vanished from her mind, whether there\n",

      "In the garden, near the railing on the street, there was a stone bench,\n",
      "screened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of yoke-elms, but\n",

      "sadness was taking possession of her little by little, that invincible\n",
      "sadness evoked by the evening, and which arises, perhaps, who knows,\n",
      "from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps Fantine was within that shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette rose, slowly made the tour of the garden, walking on the grass\n",
      "drenched in dew, and saying to herself, through the species of\n",
      "melancholy somnambulism in which she was plunged: “Really, one needs\n",
      "wooden shoes for the garden at this hour. One takes cold.”\n",
      "\n",

      "She returned to the bench.\n",

      "As she was about to resume her seat there, she observed on the spot\n",
      "which she had quitted, a tolerably large stone which had, evidently,\n",
      "not been there a moment before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette gazed at the stone, asking herself what it meant. All at once\n",
      "the idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all\n",
      "by itself, that some one had placed it there, that an arm had been\n",
      "thrust through the railing, and this idea appeared to alarm her. This\n",
      "time, the fear was genuine; the stone was there. No doubt was possible;\n",
      "she did not touch it, fled without glancing behind her, took refuge in\n",
      "the house, and immediately closed with shutter, bolt, and bar the\n",
      "door-like window opening on the flight of steps. She inquired of\n",

      "“Toussaint,” went on Cosette, “are you careful to thoroughly barricade\n",

      "“It is so solitary here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“So far as that is concerned,” said Toussaint, “it is true. We might be\n",

      "shudder, I believe you! Just imagine, what if you were to see men enter\n",
      "your chamber at night and say: ‘Hold your tongue!’ and begin to cut\n",
      "your throat. It’s not the dying so much; you die, for one must die, and\n",
      "that’s all right; it’s the abomination of feeling those people touch\n",

      "look at the stone which has been placed on the bench!” for fear of\n",
      "opening the garden gate and allowing “the men” to enter. She saw that\n",
      "all the doors and windows were carefully fastened, made Toussaint go\n",
      "all over the house from garret to cellar, locked herself up in her own\n",
      "chamber, bolted her door, looked under her couch, went to bed and slept\n",

      "week or two ago in the garden at night! It is like the shadow of the\n",
      "chimney-pot! Am I becoming a coward?” The sun, which was glowing\n",
      "through the crevices in her shutters, and turning the damask curtains\n",
      "crimson, reassured her to such an extent that everything vanished from\n",

      "She lifted the stone, which was tolerably large. Beneath it was\n",
      "something which resembled a letter. It was a white envelope. Cosette\n",

      "then, a mind which had unfolded itself there, sigh by sigh,\n",
      "irregularly, without order, without choice, without object, hap-hazard.\n",
      "Cosette had never read anything like it. This manuscript, in which she\n",

      "effect of a half-open sanctuary. Each one of these mysterious lines\n",
      "shone before her eyes and inundated her heart with a strange radiance.\n",
      "The education which she had received had always talked to her of the\n",

      "the beginning, the end. It was as if a hand had opened and suddenly\n",

      "a passionate, ardent, generous, honest nature, a sacred will, an\n",
      "immense sorrow, and an immense despair, a suffering heart, an ecstasy\n",
      "fully expanded. What was this manuscript? A letter. A letter without\n",

      "death and who sent to the absent love, his lady, the secret of fate,\n",
      "the key of life, love. This had been written with one foot in the grave\n",

      "example extant. Like the Maréchale de La Mothe-Houdancourt, the\n",
      "Thénardier was a mother to her daughters only. There her maternity\n",
      "ended. Her hatred of the human race began with her own sons. In the\n",
      "direction of her sons her evil disposition was uncompromising, and her\n",
      "heart had a lugubrious wall in that quarter. As the reader has seen,\n",
      "she detested the eldest; she cursed the other two. Why? Because. The\n",
      "most terrible of motives, the most unanswerable of retorts—Because. “I\n",

      "same one who had succeeded in making old Gillenormand support the two\n",
      "children which she had had. She lived on the Quai des Célestins, at the\n",
      "corner of this ancient street of the Petit-Musc which afforded her the\n",
      "opportunity of changing her evil repute into good odor. The reader will\n",

      "of the Seine in Paris thirty-five years ago, and of which science took\n",
      "advantage to make experiments on a grand scale as to the efficacy of\n",
      "inhalations of alum, so beneficially replaced at the present day by the\n",
      "external tincture of iodine. During this epidemic, the Magnon lost both\n",
      "her boys, who were still very young, one in the morning, the other in\n",
      "the evening of the same day. This was a blow. These children were\n",
      "precious to their mother; they represented eighty francs a month. These\n",
      "eighty francs were punctually paid in the name of M. Gillenormand, by\n",
      "collector of his rents, M. Barge, a retired tip-staff, in the Rue du\n",
      "Roi-de-Sicile. The children dead, the income was at an end. The Magnon\n",
      "sought an expedient. In that dark free-masonry of evil of which she\n",
      "formed a part, everything is known, all secrets are kept, and all lend\n",
      "mutual aid. Magnon needed two children; the Thénardiers had two. The\n",
      "same sex, the same age. A good arrangement for the one, a good\n",

      "a month, which Magnon promised to pay, and which she actually did pay.\n",
      "It is unnecessary to add that M. Gillenormand continued to perform his\n",

      "Magnon was a sort of fashionable woman in the sphere of crime. She was\n",
      "careful about her toilet. She shared her lodgings, which were furnished\n",
      "in an affected and wretched style, with a clever gallicized English\n",
      "thief. This English woman, who had become a naturalized Parisienne,\n",
      "recommended by very wealthy relations, intimately connected with the\n",

      "The two little creatures who had fallen to Magnon had no reason to\n",

      "neither badly clothed, nor badly fed; they were treated almost like\n",
      "“little gentlemen,”—better by their false mother than by their real\n",
      "one. Magnon played the lady, and talked no thieves’ slang in their\n",
      "presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus passed several years. Thénardier augured well from the fact. One\n",

      "\n",
      "A wholesale arrest of malefactors, like that in the Jondrette garret,\n",
      "necessarily complicated by investigations and subsequent\n",

      "Spring in Paris is often traversed by harsh and piercing breezes which\n",
      "do not precisely chill but freeze one; these north winds which sadden\n",
      "the most beautiful days produce exactly the effect of those puffs of\n",
      "cold air which enter a warm room through the cracks of a badly fitting\n",
      "door or window. It seems as though the gloomy door of winter had\n",
      "remained ajar, and as though the wind were pouring through it. In the\n",
      "spring of 1832, the epoch when the first great epidemic of this century\n",
      "broke out in Europe, these north gales were more harsh and piercing\n",
      "than ever. It was a door even more glacial than that of winter which\n",
      "was ajar. It was the door of the sepulchre. In these winds one felt the\n",
      "breath of the cholera.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a meteorological point of view, these cold winds possessed this\n",
      "peculiarity, that they did not preclude a strong electric tension.\n",
      "Frequent storms, accompanied by thunder and lightning, burst forth at\n",
      "this epoch.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening, when these gales were blowing rudely, to such a degree\n",
      "that January seemed to have returned and that the bourgeois had resumed\n",
      "their cloaks, Little Gavroche, who was always shivering gayly under his\n",
      "rags, was standing as though in ecstasy before a wig-maker’s shop in\n",
      "the vicinity of the Orme-Saint-Gervais. He was adorned with a woman’s\n",
      "woollen shawl, picked up no one knows where, and which he had converted\n",
      "into a neck comforter. Little Gavroche appeared to be engaged in intent\n",
      "admiration of a wax bride, in a low-necked dress, and crowned with\n",
      "orange-flowers, who was revolving in the window, and displaying her\n",
      "smile to passers-by, between two argand lamps; but in reality, he was\n",
      "taking an observation of the shop, in order to discover whether he\n",
      "could not “prig” from the shop-front a cake of soap, which he would\n",
      "then proceed to sell for a sou to a “hair-dresser” in the suburbs. He\n",
      "had often managed to breakfast off of such a roll. He called his\n",
      "species of work, for which he possessed special aptitude, “shaving\n",
      "barbers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While contemplating the bride, and eyeing the cake of soap, he muttered\n",
      "between his teeth: “Tuesday. It was not Tuesday. Was it Tuesday?\n",
      "Perhaps it was Tuesday. Yes, it was Tuesday.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No one has ever discovered to what this monologue referred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, perchance, this monologue had some connection with the last\n",
      "occasion on which he had dined, three days before, for it was now\n",
      "Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The barber in his shop, which was warmed by a good stove, was shaving a\n",
      "customer and casting a glance from time to time at the enemy, that\n",
      "freezing and impudent street urchin both of whose hands were in his\n",
      "pockets, but whose mind was evidently unsheathed.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Gavroche was scrutinizing the shop-window and the cakes of\n",
      "windsor soap, two children of unequal stature, very neatly dressed, and\n",
      "still smaller than himself, one apparently about seven years of age,\n",
      "the other five, timidly turned the handle and entered the shop, with a\n",
      "request for something or other, alms possibly, in a plaintive murmur\n",
      "which resembled a groan rather than a prayer. They both spoke at once,\n",
      "and their words were unintelligible because sobs broke the voice of the\n",
      "younger, and the teeth of the elder were chattering with cold. The\n",
      "barber wheeled round with a furious look, and without abandoning his\n",
      "razor, thrust back the elder with his left hand and the younger with\n",
      "his knee, and slammed his door, saying: “The idea of coming in and\n",
      "freezing everybody for nothing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The two children resumed their march in tears. In the meantime, a cloud\n",
      "had risen; it had begun to rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Gavroche ran after them and accosted them:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s the matter with you, brats?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t know where we are to sleep,” replied the elder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that all?” said Gavroche. “A great matter, truly. The idea of\n",
      "bawling about that. They must be greenies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And adopting, in addition to his superiority, which was rather\n",
      "bantering, an accent of tender authority and gentle patronage:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come along with me, young ’uns!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir,” said the elder.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the two children followed him as they would have followed an\n",
      "archbishop. They had stopped crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche led them up the Rue Saint-Antoine in the direction of the\n",
      "Bastille.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Gavroche walked along, he cast an indignant backward glance at the\n",
      "barber’s shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That fellow has no heart, the whiting,”35 he muttered. “He’s an\n",
      "Englishman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A woman who caught sight of these three marching in a file, with\n",
      "Gavroche at their head, burst into noisy laughter. This laugh was\n",
      "wanting in respect towards the group.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day, Mamselle Omnibus,” said Gavroche to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "An instant later, the wig-maker occurred to his mind once more, and he\n",
      "added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am making a mistake in the beast; he’s not a whiting, he’s a\n",
      "serpent. Barber, I’ll go and fetch a locksmith, and I’ll have a bell\n",
      "hung to your tail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This wig-maker had rendered him aggressive. As he strode over a gutter,\n",
      "he apostrophized a bearded portress who was worthy to meet Faust on the\n",
      "Brocken, and who had a broom in her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Madam,” said he, “so you are going out with your horse?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And thereupon, he spattered the polished boots of a pedestrian.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You scamp!” shouted the furious pedestrian.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche elevated his nose above his shawl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Monsieur complaining?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of you!” ejaculated the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The office is closed,” said Gavroche, “I do not receive any more\n",
      "complaints.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile, as he went on up the street, he perceived a\n",
      "beggar-girl, thirteen or fourteen years old, and clad in so short a\n",
      "gown that her knees were visible, lying thoroughly chilled under a\n",
      "porte-cochère. The little girl was getting to be too old for such a\n",
      "thing. Growth does play these tricks. The petticoat becomes short at\n",
      "the moment when nudity becomes indecent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor girl!” said Gavroche. “She hasn’t even trousers. Hold on, take\n",
      "this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck,\n",
      "he flung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the beggar-girl, where\n",
      "the scarf became a shawl once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The child stared at him in astonishment, and received the shawl in\n",
      "silence. When a certain stage of distress has been reached in his\n",
      "misery, the poor man no longer groans over evil, no longer returns\n",
      "thanks for good.\n",
      "\n",
      "That done: “Brrr!” said Gavroche, who was shivering more than Saint\n",
      "Martin, for the latter retained one-half of his cloak.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this _brrr!_ the downpour of rain, redoubled in its spite, became\n",
      "furious. The wicked skies punish good deeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, come now!” exclaimed Gavroche, “what’s the meaning of this? It’s\n",
      "re-raining! Good Heavens, if it goes on like this, I shall stop my\n",
      "subscription.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he set out on the march once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s all right,” he resumed, casting a glance at the beggar-girl, as\n",
      "she coiled up under the shawl, “she’s got a famous peel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And looking up at the clouds he exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Caught!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The two children followed close on his heels.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they were passing one of these heavy grated lattices, which indicate\n",
      "a baker’s shop, for bread is put behind bars like gold, Gavroche turned\n",
      "round:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, by the way, brats, have we dined?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur,” replied the elder, “we have had nothing to eat since this\n",
      "morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you have neither father nor mother?” resumed Gavroche majestically.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse us, sir, we have a papa and a mamma, but we don’t know where\n",
      "they are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sometimes that’s better than knowing where they are,” said Gavroche,\n",
      "who was a thinker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have been wandering about these two hours,” continued the elder,\n",
      "“we have hunted for things at the corners of the streets, but we have\n",
      "found nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know,” ejaculated Gavroche, “it’s the dogs who eat everything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He went on, after a pause:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! we have lost our authors. We don’t know what we have done with\n",
      "them. This should not be, gamins. It’s stupid to let old people stray\n",
      "off like that. Come now! we must have a snooze all the same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he asked them no questions. What was more simple than that\n",
      "they should have no dwelling place!\n",
      "\n",
      "The elder of the two children, who had almost entirely recovered the\n",
      "prompt heedlessness of childhood, uttered this exclamation:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s queer, all the same. Mamma told us that she would take us to get\n",
      "a blessed spray on Palm Sunday.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bosh,” said Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mamma,” resumed the elder, “is a lady who lives with Mamselle Miss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tanflûte!” retorted Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile he had halted, and for the last two minutes he had been\n",
      "feeling and fumbling in all sorts of nooks which his rags contained.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied,\n",
      "but which was triumphant, in reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us be calm, young ’uns. Here’s supper for three.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And from one of his pockets he drew forth a sou.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without allowing the two urchins time for amazement, he pushed both of\n",
      "them before him into the baker’s shop, and flung his sou on the\n",
      "counter, crying:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boy! five centimes’ worth of bread.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The baker, who was the proprietor in person, took up a loaf and a\n",
      "knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In three pieces, my boy!” went on Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he added with dignity:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are three of us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And seeing that the baker, after scrutinizing the three customers, had\n",
      "taken down a black loaf, he thrust his finger far up his nose with an\n",
      "inhalation as imperious as though he had had a pinch of the great\n",
      "Frederick’s snuff on the tip of his thumb, and hurled this indignant\n",
      "apostrophe full in the baker’s face:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keksekça?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Those of our readers who might be tempted to espy in this\n",
      "interpellation of Gavroche’s to the baker a Russian or a Polish word,\n",
      "or one of those savage cries which the Yoways and the Botocudos hurl at\n",
      "each other from bank to bank of a river, athwart the solitudes, are\n",
      "warned that it is a word which they [our readers] utter every day, and\n",
      "which takes the place of the phrase: “Qu’est-ce que c’est que cela?”\n",
      "The baker understood perfectly, and replied:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! It’s bread, and very good bread of the second quality.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean _larton brutal_ [black bread]!” retorted Gavroche, calmly and\n",
      "coldly disdainful. “White bread, boy! white bread [_larton savonné_]!\n",
      "I’m standing treat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The baker could not repress a smile, and as he cut the white bread he\n",
      "surveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, now, baker’s boy!” said he, “what are you taking our measure\n",
      "like that for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All three of them placed end to end would have hardly made a measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the bread was cut, the baker threw the sou into his drawer, and\n",
      "Gavroche said to the two children:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Grub away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The little boys stared at him in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche began to laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! hullo, that’s so! they don’t understand yet, they’re too small.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he repeated:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eat away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, he held out a piece of bread to each of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And thinking that the elder, who seemed to him the more worthy of his\n",
      "conversation, deserved some special encouragement and ought to be\n",
      "relieved from all hesitation to satisfy his appetite, he added, as he\n",
      "handed him the largest share:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ram that into your muzzle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One piece was smaller than the others; he kept this for himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor children, including Gavroche, were famished. As they tore\n",
      "their bread apart in big mouthfuls, they blocked up the shop of the\n",
      "baker, who, now that they had paid their money, looked angrily at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s go into the street again,” said Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "They set off once more in the direction of the Bastille.\n",
      "\n",
      "From time to time, as they passed the lighted shop-windows, the\n",
      "smallest halted to look at the time on a leaden watch which was\n",
      "suspended from his neck by a cord.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, he is a very green ’un,” said Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, becoming thoughtful, he muttered between his teeth:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“All the same, if I had charge of the babes I’d lock ’em up better than\n",
      "that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as they were finishing their morsel of bread, and had reached the\n",
      "angle of that gloomy Rue des Ballets, at the other end of which the low\n",
      "and threatening wicket of La Force was visible:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo, is that you, Gavroche?” said some one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo, is that you, Montparnasse?” said Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "A man had just accosted the street urchin, and the man was no other\n",
      "than Montparnasse in disguise, with blue spectacles, but recognizable\n",
      "to Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The bow-wows!” went on Gavroche, “you’ve got a hide the color of a\n",
      "linseed plaster, and blue specs like a doctor. You’re putting on style,\n",
      "‘pon my word!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush!” ejaculated Montparnasse, “not so loud.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he drew Gavroche hastily out of range of the lighted shops.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two little ones followed mechanically, holding each other by the\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were ensconced under the arch of a porte-cochère, sheltered\n",
      "from the rain and from all eyes:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know where I’m going?” demanded Montparnasse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To the Abbey of Ascend-with-Regret,”36 replied Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Joker!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And Montparnasse went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m going to find Babet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” exclaimed Gavroche, “so her name is Babet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Montparnasse lowered his voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not she, he.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! Babet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Babet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought he was buckled.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“He has undone the buckle,” replied Montparnasse.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he rapidly related to the gamin how, on the morning of that very\n",
      "day, Babet, having been transferred to La Conciergerie, had made his\n",
      "escape, by turning to the left instead of to the right in “the police\n",
      "office.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche expressed his admiration for this skill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a dentist!” he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Montparnasse added a few details as to Babet’s flight, and ended with:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! That’s not all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche, as he listened, had seized a cane that Montparnasse held in\n",
      "his hand, and mechanically pulled at the upper part, and the blade of a\n",
      "dagger made its appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” he exclaimed, pushing the dagger back in haste, “you have brought\n",
      "along your gendarme disguised as a bourgeois.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Montparnasse winked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The deuce!” resumed Gavroche, “so you’re going to have a bout with the\n",
      "bobbies?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can’t tell,” replied Montparnasse with an indifferent air. “It’s\n",
      "always a good thing to have a pin about one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche persisted:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are you up to to-night?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Montparnasse took a grave tone, and said, mouthing every\n",
      "syllable: “Things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And abruptly changing the conversation:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the way!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Something happened t’other day. Fancy. I meet a bourgeois. He makes me\n",
      "a present of a sermon and his purse. I put it in my pocket. A minute\n",
      "later, I feel in my pocket. There’s nothing there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Except the sermon,” said Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you,” went on Montparnasse, “where are you bound for now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche pointed to his two protégés, and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m going to put these infants to bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whereabouts is the bed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“At my house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“And where is your lodging?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the elephant,” said Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "Montparnasse, though not naturally inclined to astonishment, could not\n",
      "restrain an exclamation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the elephant!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, yes, in the elephant!” retorted Gavroche. “Kekçaa?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is another word of the language which no one writes, and which\n",
      "every one speaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kekçaa signifies: _Qu’est que c’est que cela a? _ [What’s the matter\n",
      "with that?]\n",
      "\n",
      "The urchin’s profound remark recalled Montparnasse to calmness and good\n",
      "sense. He appeared to return to better sentiments with regard to\n",
      "Gavroche’s lodging.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” said he, “yes, the elephant. Is it comfortable there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very,” said Gavroche. “It’s really bully there. There ain’t any\n",
      "draughts, as there are under the bridges.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you get in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I get in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“So there is a hole?” demanded Montparnasse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Parbleu! I should say so. But you mustn’t tell. It’s between the fore\n",
      "legs. The bobbies haven’t seen it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you climb up? Yes, I understand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“A turn of the hand, cric, crac, and it’s all over, no one there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After a pause, Gavroche added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall have a ladder for these children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Montparnasse burst out laughing:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where the devil did you pick up those young ’uns?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche replied with great simplicity:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are some brats that a wig-maker made me a present of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Montparnasse had fallen to thinking:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You recognized me very readily,” he muttered.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took from his pocket two small objects which were nothing more than\n",
      "two quills wrapped in cotton, and thrust one up each of his nostrils.\n",
      "This gave him a different nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That changes you,” remarked Gavroche, “you are less homely so, you\n",
      "ought to keep them on all the time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Montparnasse was a handsome fellow, but Gavroche was a tease.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seriously,” demanded Montparnasse, “how do you like me so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of his voice was different also. In a twinkling, Montparnasse\n",
      "had become unrecognizable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Do play Porrichinelle for us!” exclaimed Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two children, who had not been listening up to this point, being\n",
      "occupied themselves in thrusting their fingers up their noses, drew\n",
      "near at this name, and stared at Montparnasse with dawning joy and\n",
      "admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, Montparnasse was troubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "He laid his hand on Gavroche’s shoulder, and said to him, emphasizing\n",
      "his words: “Listen to what I tell you, boy! if I were on the square\n",
      "with my dog, my knife, and my wife, and if you were to squander ten\n",
      "sous on me, I wouldn’t refuse to work, but this isn’t Shrove Tuesday.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This odd phrase produced a singular effect on the gamin. He wheeled\n",
      "round hastily, darted his little sparkling eyes about him with profound\n",
      "attention, and perceived a police sergeant standing with his back to\n",
      "them a few paces off. Gavroche allowed an: “Ah! good!” to escape him,\n",
      "but immediately suppressed it, and shaking Montparnasse’s hand:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, good evening,” said he, “I’m going off to my elephant with my\n",
      "brats. Supposing that you should need me some night, you can come and\n",
      "hunt me up there. I lodge on the entresol. There is no porter. You will\n",
      "inquire for Monsieur Gavroche.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very good,” said Montparnasse.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they parted, Montparnasse betaking himself in the direction of the\n",
      "Grève, and Gavroche towards the Bastille. The little one of five,\n",
      "dragged along by his brother who was dragged by Gavroche, turned his\n",
      "head back several times to watch “Porrichinelle” as he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ambiguous phrase by means of which Montparnasse had warned Gavroche\n",
      "of the presence of the policeman, contained no other talisman than the\n",
      "assonance _dig_ repeated five or six times in different forms. This\n",
      "syllable, _dig_, uttered alone or artistically mingled with the words\n",
      "of a phrase, means: “Take care, we can no longer talk freely.” There\n",
      "was besides, in Montparnasse’s sentence, a literary beauty which was\n",
      "lost upon Gavroche, that is _mon dogue, ma dague et ma digue_, a slang\n",
      "expression of the Temple, which signifies my dog, my knife, and my\n",
      "wife, greatly in vogue among clowns and the red-tails in the great\n",
      "century when Molière wrote and Callot drew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty years ago, there was still to be seen in the southwest corner of\n",
      "the Place de la Bastille, near the basin of the canal, excavated in the\n",
      "ancient ditch of the fortress-prison, a singular monument, which has\n",
      "already been effaced from the memories of Parisians, and which deserved\n",
      "to leave some trace, for it was the idea of a “member of the Institute,\n",
      "the General-in-chief of the army of Egypt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We say monument, although it was only a rough model. But this model\n",
      "itself, a marvellous sketch, the grandiose skeleton of an idea of\n",
      "Napoleon’s, which successive gusts of wind have carried away and\n",
      "thrown, on each occasion, still further from us, had become historical\n",
      "and had acquired a certain definiteness which contrasted with its\n",
      "provisional aspect. It was an elephant forty feet high, constructed of\n",
      "timber and masonry, bearing on its back a tower which resembled a\n",
      "house, formerly painted green by some dauber, and now painted black by\n",
      "heaven, the wind, and time. In this deserted and unprotected corner of\n",
      "the place, the broad brow of the colossus, his trunk, his tusks, his\n",
      "tower, his enormous crupper, his four feet, like columns produced, at\n",
      "night, under the starry heavens, a surprising and terrible form. It was\n",
      "a sort of symbol of popular force. It was sombre, mysterious, and\n",
      "immense. It was some mighty, visible phantom, one knew not what,\n",
      "standing erect beside the invisible spectre of the Bastille.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few strangers visited this edifice, no passer-by looked at it. It was\n",
      "falling into ruins; every season the plaster which detached itself from\n",
      "its sides formed hideous wounds upon it. “The ædiles,” as the\n",
      "expression ran in elegant dialect, had forgotten it ever since 1814.\n",
      "There it stood in its corner, melancholy, sick, crumbling, surrounded\n",
      "by a rotten palisade, soiled continually by drunken coachmen; cracks\n",
      "meandered athwart its belly, a lath projected from its tail, tall grass\n",
      "flourished between its legs; and, as the level of the place had been\n",
      "rising all around it for a space of thirty years, by that slow and\n",
      "continuous movement which insensibly elevates the soil of large towns,\n",
      "it stood in a hollow, and it looked as though the ground were giving\n",
      "way beneath it. It was unclean, despised, repulsive, and superb, ugly\n",
      "in the eyes of the bourgeois, melancholy in the eyes of the thinker.\n",
      "There was something about it of the dirt which is on the point of being\n",
      "swept out, and something of the majesty which is on the point of being\n",
      "decapitated. As we have said, at night, its aspect changed. Night is\n",
      "the real element of everything that is dark. As soon as twilight\n",
      "descended, the old elephant became transfigured; he assumed a tranquil\n",
      "and redoubtable appearance in the formidable serenity of the shadows.\n",
      "Being of the past, he belonged to night; and obscurity was in keeping\n",
      "with his grandeur.\n",
      "\n",
      "This rough, squat, heavy, hard, austere, almost misshapen, but\n",
      "assuredly majestic monument, stamped with a sort of magnificent and\n",
      "savage gravity, has disappeared, and left to reign in peace, a sort of\n",
      "gigantic stove, ornamented with its pipe, which has replaced the sombre\n",
      "fortress with its nine towers, very much as the bourgeoisie replaces\n",
      "the feudal classes. It is quite natural that a stove should be the\n",
      "symbol of an epoch in which a pot contains power. This epoch will pass\n",
      "away, people have already begun to understand that, if there can be\n",
      "force in a boiler, there can be no force except in the brain; in other\n",
      "words, that which leads and drags on the world, is not locomotives, but\n",
      "ideas. Harness locomotives to ideas,—that is well done; but do not\n",
      "mistake the horse for the rider.\n",
      "\n",
      "At all events, to return to the Place de la Bastille, the architect of\n",
      "this elephant succeeded in making a grand thing out of plaster; the\n",
      "architect of the stove has succeeded in making a pretty thing out of\n",
      "bronze.\n",
      "\n",
      "This stove-pipe, which has been baptized by a sonorous name, and called\n",
      "the column of July, this monument of a revolution that miscarried, was\n",
      "still enveloped in 1832, in an immense shirt of woodwork, which we\n",
      "regret, for our part, and by a vast plank enclosure, which completed\n",
      "the task of isolating the elephant.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was towards this corner of the place, dimly lighted by the\n",
      "reflection of a distant street lamp, that the gamin guided his two\n",
      "“brats.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The reader must permit us to interrupt ourselves here and to remind him\n",
      "that we are dealing with simple reality, and that twenty years ago, the\n",
      "tribunals were called upon to judge, under the charge of vagabondage,\n",
      "and mutilation of a public monument, a child who had been caught asleep\n",
      "in this very elephant of the Bastille. This fact noted, we proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "On arriving in the vicinity of the colossus, Gavroche comprehended the\n",
      "effect which the infinitely great might produce on the infinitely\n",
      "small, and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be scared, infants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he entered through a gap in the fence into the elephant’s\n",
      "enclosure and helped the young ones to clamber through the breach. The\n",
      "two children, somewhat frightened, followed Gavroche without uttering a\n",
      "word, and confided themselves to this little Providence in rags which\n",
      "had given them bread and had promised them a shelter.\n",
      "\n",
      "There, extended along the fence, lay a ladder which by day served the\n",
      "laborers in the neighboring timber-yard. Gavroche raised it with\n",
      "remarkable vigor, and placed it against one of the elephant’s forelegs.\n",
      "Near the point where the ladder ended, a sort of black hole in the\n",
      "belly of the colossus could be distinguished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche pointed out the ladder and the hole to his guests, and said to\n",
      "them:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Climb up and go in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The two little boys exchanged terrified glances.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re afraid, brats!” exclaimed Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall see!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He clasped the rough leg of the elephant, and in a twinkling, without\n",
      "deigning to make use of the ladder, he had reached the aperture. He\n",
      "entered it as an adder slips through a crevice, and disappeared within,\n",
      "and an instant later, the two children saw his head, which looked pale,\n",
      "appear vaguely, on the edge of the shadowy hole, like a wan and whitish\n",
      "spectre.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” he exclaimed, “climb up, young ’uns! You’ll see how snug it is\n",
      "here! Come up, you!” he said to the elder, “I’ll lend you a hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The little fellows nudged each other, the gamin frightened and inspired\n",
      "them with confidence at one and the same time, and then, it was raining\n",
      "very hard. The elder one undertook the risk. The younger, on seeing his\n",
      "brother climbing up, and himself left alone between the paws of this\n",
      "huge beast, felt greatly inclined to cry, but he did not dare.\n",
      "\n",
      "The elder lad climbed, with uncertain steps, up the rungs of the\n",
      "ladder; Gavroche, in the meanwhile, encouraging him with exclamations\n",
      "like a fencing-master to his pupils, or a muleteer to his mules.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be afraid!—That’s it!—Come on!—Put your feet there!—Give us your\n",
      "hand here!—Boldly!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And when the child was within reach, he seized him suddenly and\n",
      "vigorously by the arm, and pulled him towards him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nabbed!” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brat had passed through the crack.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said Gavroche, “wait for me. Be so good as to take a seat,\n",
      "Monsieur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And making his way out of the hole as he had entered it, he slipped\n",
      "down the elephant’s leg with the agility of a monkey, landed on his\n",
      "feet in the grass, grasped the child of five round the body, and\n",
      "planted him fairly in the middle of the ladder, then he began to climb\n",
      "up behind him, shouting to the elder:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m going to boost him, do you tug.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And in another instant, the small lad was pushed, dragged, pulled,\n",
      "thrust, stuffed into the hole, before he had time to recover himself,\n",
      "and Gavroche, entering behind him, and repulsing the ladder with a kick\n",
      "which sent it flat on the grass, began to clap his hands and to cry:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here we are! Long live General Lafayette!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This explosion over, he added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, young ’uns, you are in my house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche was at home, in fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, unforeseen utility of the useless! Charity of great things!\n",
      "Goodness of giants! This huge monument, which had embodied an idea of\n",
      "the Emperor’s, had become the box of a street urchin. The brat had been\n",
      "accepted and sheltered by the colossus. The bourgeois decked out in\n",
      "their Sunday finery who passed the elephant of the Bastille, were fond\n",
      "of saying as they scanned it disdainfully with their prominent eyes:\n",
      "“What’s the good of that?” It served to save from the cold, the frost,\n",
      "the hail, and rain, to shelter from the winds of winter, to preserve\n",
      "from slumber in the mud which produces fever, and from slumber in the\n",
      "snow which produces death, a little being who had no father, no mother,\n",
      "no bread, no clothes, no refuge. It served to receive the innocent whom\n",
      "society repulsed. It served to diminish public crime. It was a lair\n",
      "open to one against whom all doors were shut. It seemed as though the\n",
      "miserable old mastodon, invaded by vermin and oblivion, covered with\n",
      "warts, with mould, and ulcers, tottering, worm-eaten, abandoned,\n",
      "condemned, a sort of mendicant colossus, asking alms in vain with a\n",
      "benevolent look in the midst of the crossroads, had taken pity on that\n",
      "other mendicant, the poor pygmy, who roamed without shoes to his feet,\n",
      "without a roof over his head, blowing on his fingers, clad in rags, fed\n",
      "on rejected scraps. That was what the elephant of the Bastille was good\n",
      "for. This idea of Napoleon, disdained by men, had been taken back by\n",
      "God. That which had been merely illustrious, had become august. In\n",
      "order to realize his thought, the Emperor should have had porphyry,\n",
      "brass, iron, gold, marble; the old collection of planks, beams and\n",
      "plaster sufficed for God. The Emperor had had the dream of a genius; in\n",
      "that Titanic elephant, armed, prodigious, with trunk uplifted, bearing\n",
      "its tower and scattering on all sides its merry and vivifying waters,\n",
      "he wished to incarnate the people. God had done a grander thing with\n",
      "it, he had lodged a child there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hole through which Gavroche had entered was a breach which was\n",
      "hardly visible from the outside, being concealed, as we have stated,\n",
      "beneath the elephant’s belly, and so narrow that it was only cats and\n",
      "homeless children who could pass through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s begin,” said Gavroche, “by telling the porter that we are not at\n",
      "home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who is\n",
      "well acquainted with his apartments, he took a plank and stopped up the\n",
      "aperture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Gavroche plunged into the obscurity. The children heard the\n",
      "crackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle. The chemical\n",
      "match was not yet in existence; at that epoch the Fumade steel\n",
      "represented progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sudden light made them blink; Gavroche had just managed to ignite one\n",
      "of those bits of cord dipped in resin which are called _cellar rats_.\n",
      "The _cellar rat_, which emitted more smoke than light, rendered the\n",
      "interior of the elephant confusedly visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche’s two guests glanced about them, and the sensation which they\n",
      "experienced was something like that which one would feel if shut up in\n",
      "the great tun of Heidelberg, or, better still, like what Jonah must\n",
      "have felt in the biblical belly of the whale. An entire and gigantic\n",
      "skeleton appeared enveloping them. Above, a long brown beam, whence\n",
      "started at regular distances, massive, arching ribs, represented the\n",
      "vertebral column with its sides, stalactites of plaster depended from\n",
      "them like entrails, and vast spiders’ webs stretching from side to\n",
      "side, formed dirty diaphragms. Here and there, in the corners, were\n",
      "visible large blackish spots which had the appearance of being alive,\n",
      "and which changed places rapidly with an abrupt and frightened\n",
      "movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fragments which had fallen from the elephant’s back into his belly had\n",
      "filled up the cavity, so that it was possible to walk upon it as on a\n",
      "floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smaller child nestled up against his brother, and whispered to\n",
      "him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s black.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This remark drew an exclamation from Gavroche. The petrified air of the\n",
      "two brats rendered some shock necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s that you are gabbling about there?” he exclaimed. “Are you\n",
      "scoffing at me? Are you turning up your noses? Do you want the\n",
      "Tuileries? Are you brutes? Come, say! I warn you that I don’t belong to\n",
      "the regiment of simpletons. Ah, come now, are you brats from the Pope’s\n",
      "establishment?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A little roughness is good in cases of fear. It is reassuring. The two\n",
      "children drew close to Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche, paternally touched by this confidence, passed from grave to\n",
      "gentle, and addressing the smaller:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stupid,” said he, accenting the insulting word, with a caressing\n",
      "intonation, “it’s outside that it is black. Outside it’s raining, here\n",
      "it does not rain; outside it’s cold, here there’s not an atom of wind;\n",
      "outside there are heaps of people, here there’s no one; outside there\n",
      "ain’t even the moon, here there’s my candle, confound it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The two children began to look upon the apartment with less terror; but\n",
      "Gavroche allowed them no more time for contemplation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quick,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he pushed them towards what we are very glad to be able to call the\n",
      "end of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "There stood his bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche’s bed was complete; that is to say, it had a mattress, a\n",
      "blanket, and an alcove with curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mattress was a straw mat, the blanket a rather large strip of gray\n",
      "woollen stuff, very warm and almost new. This is what the alcove\n",
      "consisted of:—\n",
      "\n",
      "Three rather long poles, thrust into and consolidated, with the rubbish\n",
      "which formed the floor, that is to say, the belly of the elephant, two\n",
      "in front and one behind, and united by a rope at their summits, so as\n",
      "to form a pyramidal bundle. This cluster supported a trellis-work of\n",
      "brass wire which was simply placed upon it, but artistically applied,\n",
      "and held by fastenings of iron wire, so that it enveloped all three\n",
      "holes. A row of very heavy stones kept this network down to the floor\n",
      "so that nothing could pass under it. This grating was nothing else than\n",
      "a piece of the brass screens with which aviaries are covered in\n",
      "menageries. Gavroche’s bed stood as in a cage, behind this net. The\n",
      "whole resembled an Esquimaux tent.\n",
      "\n",
      "This trellis-work took the place of curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front,\n",
      "and the two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Down on all fours, brats!” said Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "He made his guests enter the cage with great precaution, then he\n",
      "crawled in after them, pulled the stones together, and closed the\n",
      "opening hermetically again.\n",
      "\n",
      "All three had stretched out on the mat. Gavroche still had the _cellar\n",
      "rat_ in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said he, “go to sleep! I’m going to suppress the candelabra.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur,” the elder of the brothers asked Gavroche, pointing to the\n",
      "netting, “what’s that for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That,” answered Gavroche gravely, “is for the rats. Go to sleep!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction for the\n",
      "benefit of these young creatures, and he continued:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a thing from the Jardin des Plantes. It’s used for fierce\n",
      "animals. There’s a whole shopful of them there. All you’ve got to do is\n",
      "to climb over a wall, crawl through a window, and pass through a door.\n",
      "You can get as much as you want.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke, he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a fold of the\n",
      "blanket, and the little one murmured:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! how good that is! It’s warm!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s from the Jardin des Plantes, too,” said he. “I took that from\n",
      "the monkeys.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And, pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying, a very\n",
      "thick and admirably made mat, he added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“That belonged to the giraffe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After a pause he went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The beasts had all these things. I took them away from them. It didn’t\n",
      "trouble them. I told them: ‘It’s for the elephant.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, and then resumed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You crawl over the walls and you don’t care a straw for the\n",
      "government. So there now!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The two children gazed with timid and stupefied respect on this\n",
      "intrepid and ingenious being, a vagabond like themselves, isolated like\n",
      "themselves, frail like themselves, who had something admirable and\n",
      "all-powerful about him, who seemed supernatural to them, and whose\n",
      "physiognomy was composed of all the grimaces of an old mountebank,\n",
      "mingled with the most ingenuous and charming smiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur,” ventured the elder timidly, “you are not afraid of the\n",
      "police, then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche contented himself with replying:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Brat! Nobody says ‘police,’ they say ‘bobbies.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The smaller had his eyes wide open, but he said nothing. As he was on\n",
      "the edge of the mat, the elder being in the middle, Gavroche tucked the\n",
      "blanket round him as a mother might have done, and heightened the mat\n",
      "under his head with old rags, in such a way as to form a pillow for the\n",
      "child. Then he turned to the elder:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey! We’re jolly comfortable here, ain’t we?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, yes!” replied the elder, gazing at Gavroche with the expression of\n",
      "a saved angel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two poor little children who had been soaked through, began to grow\n",
      "warm once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, by the way,” continued Gavroche, “what were you bawling about?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And pointing out the little one to his brother:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“A mite like that, I’ve nothing to say about, but the idea of a big\n",
      "fellow like you crying! It’s idiotic; you looked like a calf.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gracious,” replied the child, “we have no lodging.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bother!” retorted Gavroche, “you don’t say ‘lodgings,’ you say\n",
      "‘crib.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then, we were afraid of being alone like that at night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t say ‘night,’ you say ‘darkmans.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, sir,” said the child.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen,” went on Gavroche, “you must never bawl again over anything.\n",
      "I’ll take care of you. You shall see what fun we’ll have. In summer,\n",
      "we’ll go to the Glacière with Navet, one of my pals, we’ll bathe in the\n",
      "Gare, we’ll run stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at\n",
      "Austerlitz,—that makes the laundresses raging. They scream, they get\n",
      "mad, and if you only knew how ridiculous they are! We’ll go and see the\n",
      "man-skeleton. And then I’ll take you to the play. I’ll take you to see\n",
      "Frédérick Lemaître. I have tickets, I know some of the actors, I even\n",
      "played in a piece once. There were a lot of us fellers, and we ran\n",
      "under a cloth, and that made the sea. I’ll get you an engagement at my\n",
      "theatre. We’ll go to see the savages. They ain’t real, those savages\n",
      "ain’t. They wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles, and you can see\n",
      "where their elbows have been darned with white. Then, we’ll go to the\n",
      "Opera. We’ll get in with the hired applauders. The Opera claque is well\n",
      "managed. I wouldn’t associate with the claque on the boulevard. At the\n",
      "Opera, just fancy! some of them pay twenty sous, but they’re ninnies.\n",
      "They’re called dishclouts. And then we’ll go to see the guillotine\n",
      "work. I’ll show you the executioner. He lives in the Rue des Marais.\n",
      "Monsieur Sanson. He has a letter-box at his door. Ah! we’ll have famous\n",
      "fun!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment a drop of wax fell on Gavroche’s finger, and recalled\n",
      "him to the realities of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The deuce!” said he, “there’s the wick giving out. Attention! I can’t\n",
      "spend more than a sou a month on my lighting. When a body goes to bed,\n",
      "he must sleep. We haven’t the time to read M. Paul de Kock’s romances.\n",
      "And besides, the light might pass through the cracks of the\n",
      "porte-cochère, and all the bobbies need to do is to see it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then,” remarked the elder timidly,—he alone dared talk to\n",
      "Gavroche, and reply to him, “a spark might fall in the straw, and we\n",
      "must look out and not burn the house down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“People don’t say ‘burn the house down,’” remarked Gavroche, “they say\n",
      "‘blaze the crib.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The storm increased in violence, and the heavy downpour beat upon the\n",
      "back of the colossus amid claps of thunder. “You’re taken in, rain!”\n",
      "said Gavroche. “It amuses me to hear the decanter run down the legs of\n",
      "the house. Winter is a stupid; it wastes its merchandise, it loses its\n",
      "labor, it can’t wet us, and that makes it kick up a row, old\n",
      "water-carrier that it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This allusion to the thunder, all the consequences of which Gavroche,\n",
      "in his character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century, accepted,\n",
      "was followed by a broad flash of lightning, so dazzling that a hint of\n",
      "it entered the belly of the elephant through the crack. Almost at the\n",
      "same instant, the thunder rumbled with great fury. The two little\n",
      "creatures uttered a shriek, and started up so eagerly that the network\n",
      "came near being displaced, but Gavroche turned his bold face to them,\n",
      "and took advantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Calm down, children. Don’t topple over the edifice. That’s fine,\n",
      "first-class thunder; all right. That’s no slouch of a streak of\n",
      "lightning. Bravo for the good God! Deuce take it! It’s almost as good\n",
      "as it is at the Ambigu.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, he restored order in the netting, pushed the two children\n",
      "gently down on the bed, pressed their knees, in order to stretch them\n",
      "out at full length, and exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Since the good God is lighting his candle, I can blow out mine. Now,\n",
      "babes, now, my young humans, you must shut your peepers. It’s very bad\n",
      "not to sleep. It’ll make you swallow the strainer, or, as they say, in\n",
      "fashionable society, stink in the gullet. Wrap yourself up well in the\n",
      "hide! I’m going to put out the light. Are you ready?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” murmured the elder, “I’m all right. I seem to have feathers\n",
      "under my head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“People don’t say ‘head,’” cried Gavroche, “they say ‘nut’.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The two children nestled close to each other, Gavroche finished\n",
      "arranging them on the mat, drew the blanket up to their very ears, then\n",
      "repeated, for the third time, his injunction in the hieratical tongue:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shut your peepers!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he snuffed out his tiny light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly had the light been extinguished, when a peculiar trembling began\n",
      "to affect the netting under which the three children lay.\n",
      "\n",
      "It consisted of a multitude of dull scratches which produced a metallic\n",
      "sound, as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire. This was\n",
      "accompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little five-year-old boy, on hearing this hubbub overhead, and\n",
      "chilled with terror, jogged his brother’s elbow; but the elder brother\n",
      "had already shut his peepers, as Gavroche had ordered. Then the little\n",
      "one, who could no longer control his terror, questioned Gavroche, but\n",
      "in a very low tone, and with bated breath:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey?” said Gavroche, who had just closed his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the rats,” replied Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he laid his head down on the mat again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rats, in fact, who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of the\n",
      "elephant, and who were the living black spots which we have already\n",
      "mentioned, had been held in awe by the flame of the candle, so long as\n",
      "it had been lighted; but as soon as the cavern, which was the same as\n",
      "their city, had returned to darkness, scenting what the good\n",
      "story-teller Perrault calls “fresh meat,” they had hurled themselves in\n",
      "throngs on Gavroche’s tent, had climbed to the top of it, and had begun\n",
      "to bite the meshes as though seeking to pierce this new-fangled trap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still the little one could not sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir?” he began again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey?” said Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are rats?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are mice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This explanation reassured the child a little. He had seen white mice\n",
      "in the course of his life, and he was not afraid of them. Nevertheless,\n",
      "he lifted up his voice once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey?” said Gavroche again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t you have a cat?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did have one,” replied Gavroche, “I brought one here, but they ate\n",
      "her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This second explanation undid the work of the first, and the little\n",
      "fellow began to tremble again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dialogue between him and Gavroche began again for the fourth time:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who was it that was eaten?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The cat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who ate the cat?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The rats.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The mice?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, the rats.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The child, in consternation, dismayed at the thought of mice which ate\n",
      "cats, pursued:—\n",
      "\n",

      "“Don’t be afraid. They can’t get in. And besides, I’m here! Here, catch\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time Gavroche grasped the little fellow’s hand across his\n",
      "brother. The child pressed the hand close to him, and felt reassured.\n",
      "Courage and strength have these mysterious ways of communicating\n",
      "themselves. Silence reigned round them once more, the sound of their\n",
      "voices had frightened off the rats; at the expiration of a few minutes,\n",
      "they came raging back, but in vain, the three little fellows were fast\n",
      "asleep and heard nothing more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hours of the night fled away. Darkness covered the vast Place de la\n",
      "Bastille. A wintry gale, which mingled with the rain, blew in gusts,\n",
      "the patrol searched all the doorways, alleys, enclosures, and obscure\n",
      "nooks, and in their search for nocturnal vagabonds they passed in\n",
      "silence before the elephant; the monster, erect, motionless, staring\n",
      "open-eyed into the shadows, had the appearance of dreaming happily over\n",
      "his good deed; and sheltered from heaven and from men the three poor\n",
      "sleeping children.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to understand what is about to follow, the reader must\n",
      "remember, that, at that epoch, the Bastille guard-house was situated at\n",
      "the other end of the square, and that what took place in the vicinity\n",
      "of the elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn, a man\n",
      "turned from the Rue Saint-Antoine at a run, made the circuit of the\n",
      "enclosure of the column of July, and glided between the palings until\n",
      "he was underneath the belly of the elephant. If any light had\n",
      "illuminated that man, it might have been divined from the thorough\n",
      "manner in which he was soaked that he had passed the night in the rain.\n",
      "Arrived beneath the elephant, he uttered a peculiar cry, which did not\n",
      "belong to any human tongue, and which a paroquet alone could have\n",
      "imitated. Twice he repeated this cry, of whose orthography the\n",
      "following barely conveys an idea:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kirikikiou!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At the second cry, a clear, young, merry voice responded from the belly\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost immediately, the plank which closed the hole was drawn aside,\n",
      "and gave passage to a child who descended the elephant’s leg, and fell\n",
      "briskly near the man. It was Gavroche. The man was Montparnasse.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for his cry of _Kirikikiou_,—that was, doubtless, what the child had\n",
      "meant, when he said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will ask for Monsieur Gavroche.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing it, he had waked with a start, had crawled out of his\n",
      "“alcove,” pushing apart the netting a little, and carefully drawing it\n",
      "together again, then he had opened the trap, and descended.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man and the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom:\n",
      "Montparnasse confined himself to the remark:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“We need you. Come, lend us a hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The lad asked for no further enlightenment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m with you,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "And both took their way towards the Rue Saint-Antoine, whence\n",

      "market-gardeners’ carts which descend towards the markets at that hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The market-gardeners, crouching, half-asleep, in their wagons, amid the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what had taken place that same night at the La Force:—\n",
      "\n",
      "An escape had been planned between Babet, Brujon, Guelemer, and\n",
      "Thénardier, although Thénardier was in close confinement. Babet had\n",
      "arranged the matter for his own benefit, on the same day, as the reader\n",
      "has seen from Montparnasse’s account to Gavroche. Montparnasse was to\n",
      "help them from outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brujon, after having passed a month in the punishment cell, had had\n",
      "time, in the first place, to weave a rope, in the second, to mature a\n",
      "plan. In former times, those severe places where the discipline of the\n",
      "prison delivers the convict into his own hands, were composed of four\n",
      "stone walls, a stone ceiling, a flagged pavement, a camp bed, a grated\n",
      "window, and a door lined with iron, and were called _dungeons_; but the\n",
      "dungeon was judged to be too terrible; nowadays they are composed of an\n",
      "iron door, a grated window, a camp bed, a flagged pavement, four stone\n",
      "walls, and a stone ceiling, and are called _chambers of punishment_. A\n",
      "little light penetrates towards midday. The inconvenient point about\n",
      "these chambers which, as the reader sees, are not dungeons, is that\n",
      "they allow the persons who should be at work to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Brujon meditated, and he emerged from the chamber of punishment with\n",
      "a rope. As he had the name of being very dangerous in the Charlemagne\n",
      "courtyard, he was placed in the New Building. The first thing he found\n",
      "in the New Building was Guelemer, the second was a nail; Guelemer, that\n",
      "is to say, crime; a nail, that is to say, liberty. Brujon, of whom it\n",
      "is high time that the reader should have a complete idea, was, with an\n",
      "appearance of delicate health and a profoundly premeditated languor, a\n",
      "polished, intelligent sprig, and a thief, who had a caressing glance,\n",
      "and an atrocious smile. His glance resulted from his will, and his\n",
      "smile from his nature. His first studies in his art had been directed\n",
      "to roofs. He had made great progress in the industry of the men who\n",
      "tear off lead, who plunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by the\n",
      "process called _double pickings_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment peculiarly\n",
      "favorable for an attempt at escape, was that the roofers were re-laying\n",
      "and re-jointing, at that very moment, a portion of the slates on the\n",
      "prison. The Saint-Bernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated\n",
      "from the Charlemagne and the Saint-Louis courts. Up above there were\n",
      "scaffoldings and ladders; in other words, bridges and stairs in the\n",
      "direction of liberty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The New Building, which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to be\n",
      "seen anywhere in the world, was the weak point in the prison. The walls\n",
      "were eaten by saltpetre to such an extent that the authorities had been\n",
      "obliged to line the vaults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood,\n",
      "because stones were in the habit of becoming detached and falling on\n",
      "the prisoners in their beds. In spite of this antiquity, the\n",
      "authorities committed the error of confining in the New Building the\n",
      "most troublesome prisoners, of placing there “the hard cases,” as they\n",
      "say in prison parlance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The New Building contained four dormitories, one above the other, and a\n",
      "top story which was called the Bel-Air (Fine-Air). A large\n",
      "chimney-flue, probably from some ancient kitchen of the Dukes de la\n",
      "Force, started from the ground floor, traversed all four stories, cut\n",
      "the dormitories, where it figured as a flattened pillar, into two\n",
      "portions, and finally pierced the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guelemer and Brujon were in the same dormitory. They had been placed,\n",
      "by way of precaution, on the lower story. Chance ordained that the\n",
      "heads of their beds should rest against the chimney.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier was directly over their heads in the top story known as\n",
      "Fine-Air. The pedestrian who halts on the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine,\n",
      "after passing the barracks of the firemen, in front of the\n",
      "porte-cochère of the bathing establishment, beholds a yard full of\n",
      "flowers and shrubs in wooden boxes, at the extremity of which spreads\n",
      "out a little white rotunda with two wings, brightened up with green\n",
      "shutters, the bucolic dream of Jean Jacques.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not more than ten years ago, there rose above that rotunda an enormous\n",
      "black, hideous, bare wall by which it was backed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the outer wall of La Force.\n",
      "\n",
      "This wall, beside that rotunda, was Milton viewed through Berquin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lofty as it was, this wall was overtopped by a still blacker roof,\n",
      "which could be seen beyond. This was the roof of the New Building.\n",
      "There one could descry four dormer-windows, guarded with bars; they\n",
      "were the windows of the Fine-Air.\n",
      "\n",
      "A chimney pierced the roof; this was the chimney which traversed the\n",
      "dormitories.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bel-Air, that top story of the New Building, was a sort of large\n",
      "hall, with a Mansard roof, guarded with triple gratings and double\n",
      "doors of sheet iron, which were studded with enormous bolts. When one\n",
      "entered from the north end, one had on one’s left the four\n",
      "dormer-windows, on one’s right, facing the windows, at regular\n",
      "intervals, four square, tolerably vast cages, separated by narrow\n",
      "passages, built of masonry to about the height of the elbow, and the\n",
      "rest, up to the roof, of iron bars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these cages since\n",
      "the night of the 3d of February. No one was ever able to discover how,\n",
      "and by what connivance, he succeeded in procuring, and secreting a\n",
      "bottle of wine, invented, so it is said, by Desrues, with which a\n",
      "narcotic is mixed, and which the band of the _Endormeurs_, or\n",
      "_Sleep-compellers_, rendered famous.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are, in many prisons, treacherous employees, half-jailers,\n",
      "half-thieves, who assist in escapes, who sell to the police an\n",
      "unfaithful service, and who turn a penny whenever they can.\n",
      "\n",
      "On that same night, then, when Little Gavroche picked up the two lost\n",
      "children, Brujon and Guelemer, who knew that Babet, who had escaped\n",
      "that morning, was waiting for them in the street as well as\n",
      "Montparnasse, rose softly, and with the nail which Brujon had found,\n",
      "began to pierce the chimney against which their beds stood. The rubbish\n",
      "fell on Brujon’s bed, so that they were not heard. Showers mingled with\n",
      "thunder shook the doors on their hinges, and created in the prison a\n",
      "terrible and opportune uproar. Those of the prisoners who woke,\n",
      "pretended to fall asleep again, and left Guelemer and Brujon to their\n",
      "own devices. Brujon was adroit; Guelemer was vigorous. Before any sound\n",
      "had reached the watcher, who was sleeping in the grated cell which\n",
      "opened into the dormitory, the wall had been pierced, the chimney\n",
      "scaled, the iron grating which barred the upper orifice of the flue\n",
      "forced, and the two redoubtable ruffians were on the roof. The wind and\n",
      "rain redoubled, the roof was slippery.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a good night to leg it!” said Brujon.\n",
      "\n",
      "An abyss six feet broad and eighty feet deep separated them from the\n",
      "surrounding wall. At the bottom of this abyss, they could see the\n",
      "musket of a sentinel gleaming through the gloom. They fastened one end\n",
      "of the rope which Brujon had spun in his dungeon to the stumps of the\n",
      "iron bars which they had just wrenched off, flung the other over the\n",
      "outer wall, crossed the abyss at one bound, clung to the coping of the\n",
      "wall, got astride of it, let themselves slip, one after the other,\n",
      "along the rope, upon a little roof which touches the bath-house, pulled\n",
      "their rope after them, jumped down into the courtyard of the\n",
      "bath-house, traversed it, pushed open the porter’s wicket, beside which\n",
      "hung his rope, pulled this, opened the porte-cochère, and found\n",
      "themselves in the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three-quarters of an hour had not elapsed since they had risen in bed\n",
      "in the dark, nail in hand, and their project in their heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few moments later they had joined Babet and Montparnasse, who were\n",
      "prowling about the neighborhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had broken their rope in pulling it after them, and a bit of it\n",
      "remained attached to the chimney on the roof. They had sustained no\n",
      "other damage, however, than that of scratching nearly all the skin off\n",
      "their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night, Thénardier was warned, without any one being able to\n",
      "explain how, and was not asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards one o’clock in the morning, the night being very dark, he saw\n",
      "two shadows pass along the roof, in the rain and squalls, in front of\n",
      "the dormer-window which was opposite his cage. One halted at the\n",
      "window, long enough to dart in a glance. This was Brujon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier recognized him, and understood. This was enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier, rated as a burglar, and detained as a measure of precaution\n",
      "under the charge of organizing a nocturnal ambush, with armed force,\n",
      "was kept in sight. The sentry, who was relieved every two hours,\n",
      "marched up and down in front of his cage with loaded musket. The\n",
      "Fine-Air was lighted by a skylight. The prisoner had on his feet\n",
      "fetters weighing fifty pounds. Every day, at four o’clock in the\n",
      "afternoon, a jailer, escorted by two dogs,—this was still in vogue at\n",
      "that time,—entered his cage, deposited beside his bed a loaf of black\n",
      "bread weighing two pounds, a jug of water, a bowl filled with rather\n",
      "thin bouillon, in which swam a few Mayagan beans, inspected his irons\n",
      "and tapped the bars. This man and his dogs made two visits during the\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron bolt which he\n",
      "used to spike his bread into a crack in the wall, “in order to preserve\n",
      "it from the rats,” as he said. As Thénardier was kept in sight, no\n",
      "objection had been made to this spike. Still, it was remembered\n",
      "afterwards, that one of the jailers had said: “It would be better to\n",
      "let him have only a wooden spike.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At two o’clock in the morning, the sentinel, who was an old soldier,\n",
      "was relieved, and replaced by a conscript. A few moments later, the man\n",
      "with the dogs paid his visit, and went off without noticing anything,\n",
      "except, possibly, the excessive youth and “the rustic air” of the “raw\n",
      "recruit.” Two hours afterwards, at four o’clock, when they came to\n",
      "relieve the conscript, he was found asleep on the floor, lying like a\n",
      "log near Thénardier’s cage. As for Thénardier, he was no longer there.\n",
      "There was a hole in the ceiling of his cage, and, above it, another\n",
      "hole in the roof. One of the planks of his bed had been wrenched off,\n",
      "and probably carried away with him, as it was not found. They also\n",
      "seized in his cell a half-empty bottle which contained the remains of\n",
      "the stupefying wine with which the soldier had been drugged. The\n",
      "soldier’s bayonet had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment when this discovery was made, it was assumed that\n",
      "Thénardier was out of reach. The truth is, that he was no longer in the\n",
      "New Building, but that he was still in great danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier, on reaching the roof of the New Building, had found the\n",
      "remains of Brujon’s rope hanging to the bars of the upper trap of the\n",
      "chimney, but, as this broken fragment was much too short, he had not\n",
      "been able to escape by the outer wall, as Brujon and Guelemer had done.\n",
      "\n",
      "When one turns from the Rue des Ballets into the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile,\n",
      "one almost immediately encounters a repulsive ruin. There stood on that\n",
      "spot, in the last century, a house of which only the back wall now\n",
      "remains, a regular wall of masonry, which rises to the height of the\n",
      "third story between the adjoining buildings. This ruin can be\n",
      "recognized by two large square windows which are still to be seen\n",
      "there; the middle one, that nearest the right gable, is barred with a\n",
      "worm-eaten beam adjusted like a prop. Through these windows there was\n",
      "formerly visible a lofty and lugubrious wall, which was a fragment of\n",
      "the outer wall of La Force.\n",
      "\n",
      "The empty space on the street left by the demolished house is\n",
      "half-filled by a fence of rotten boards, shored up by five stone posts.\n",
      "In this recess lies concealed a little shanty which leans against the\n",
      "portion of the ruin which has remained standing. The fence has a gate,\n",
      "which, a few years ago, was fastened only by a latch.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the crest of this ruin that Thénardier had succeeded in\n",
      "reaching, a little after one o’clock in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "How had he got there? That is what no one has ever been able to explain\n",
      "or understand. The lightning must, at the same time, have hindered and\n",
      "helped him. Had he made use of the ladders and scaffoldings of the\n",
      "slaters to get from roof to roof, from enclosure to enclosure, from\n",
      "compartment to compartment, to the buildings of the Charlemagne court,\n",
      "then to the buildings of the Saint-Louis court, to the outer wall, and\n",
      "thence to the hut on the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile? But in that itinerary\n",
      "there existed breaks which seemed to render it an impossibility. Had he\n",
      "placed the plank from his bed like a bridge from the roof of the\n",
      "Fine-Air to the outer wall, and crawled flat, on his belly on the\n",
      "coping of the outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as\n",
      "the hut? But the outer wall of La Force formed a crenellated and\n",
      "unequal line; it mounted and descended, it dropped at the firemen’s\n",
      "barracks, it rose towards the bath-house, it was cut in twain by\n",
      "buildings, it was not even of the same height on the Hotel Lamoignon as\n",
      "on the Rue Pavée; everywhere occurred falls and right angles; and then,\n",
      "the sentinels must have espied the dark form of the fugitive; hence,\n",
      "the route taken by Thénardier still remains rather inexplicable. In two\n",
      "manners, flight was impossible. Had Thénardier, spurred on by that\n",
      "thirst for liberty which changes precipices into ditches, iron bars\n",
      "into wattles of osier, a legless man into an athlete, a gouty man into\n",
      "a bird, stupidity into instinct, instinct into intelligence, and\n",
      "intelligence into genius, had Thénardier invented a third mode? No one\n",
      "has ever found out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The marvels of escape cannot always be accounted for. The man who makes\n",
      "his escape, we repeat, is inspired; there is something of the star and\n",
      "of the lightning in the mysterious gleam of flight; the effort towards\n",
      "deliverance is no less surprising than the flight towards the sublime,\n",
      "and one says of the escaped thief: “How did he contrive to scale that\n",
      "wall?” in the same way that one says of Corneille: “Where did he find\n",
      "_the means of dying?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At all events, dripping with perspiration, drenched with rain, with his\n",
      "clothes hanging in ribbons, his hands flayed, his elbows bleeding, his\n",
      "knees torn, Thénardier had reached what children, in their figurative\n",
      "language, call _the edge_ of the wall of the ruin, there he had\n",
      "stretched himself out at full length, and there his strength had failed\n",
      "him. A steep escarpment three stories high separated him from the\n",
      "pavement of the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rope which he had was too short.\n",
      "\n",
      "There he waited, pale, exhausted, desperate with all the despair which\n",
      "he had undergone, still hidden by the night, but telling himself that\n",
      "the day was on the point of dawning, alarmed at the idea of hearing the\n",
      "neighboring clock of Saint-Paul strike four within a few minutes, an\n",
      "hour when the sentinel was relieved and when the latter would be found\n",
      "asleep under the pierced roof, staring in horror at a terrible depth,\n",
      "at the light of the street lanterns, the wet, black pavement, that\n",
      "pavement longed for yet frightful, which meant death, and which meant\n",
      "liberty.\n",
      "\n",
      "He asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded,\n",
      "if they had heard him, and if they would come to his assistance. He\n",
      "listened. With the exception of the patrol, no one had passed through\n",
      "the street since he had been there. Nearly the whole of the descent of\n",
      "the market-gardeners from Montreuil, from Charonne, from Vincennes, and\n",
      "from Bercy to the markets was accomplished through the Rue\n",
      "Saint-Antoine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four o’clock struck. Thénardier shuddered. A few moments later, that\n",
      "terrified and confused uproar which follows the discovery of an escape\n",
      "broke forth in the prison. The sound of doors opening and shutting, the\n",
      "creaking of gratings on their hinges, a tumult in the guard-house, the\n",
      "hoarse shouts of the turnkeys, the shock of musket-butts on the\n",
      "pavement of the courts, reached his ears. Lights ascended and descended\n",
      "past the grated windows of the dormitories, a torch ran along the\n",
      "ridge-pole of the top story of the New Building, the firemen belonging\n",
      "in the barracks on the right had been summoned. Their helmets, which\n",
      "the torch lighted up in the rain, went and came along the roofs. At the\n",
      "same time, Thénardier perceived in the direction of the Bastille a wan\n",
      "whiteness lighting up the edge of the sky in doleful wise.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was on top of a wall ten inches wide, stretched out under the heavy\n",
      "rains, with two gulfs to right and left, unable to stir, subject to the\n",
      "giddiness of a possible fall, and to the horror of a certain arrest,\n",
      "and his thoughts, like the pendulum of a clock, swung from one of these\n",
      "ideas to the other: “Dead if I fall, caught if I stay.” In the midst of\n",
      "this anguish, he suddenly saw, the street being still dark, a man who\n",
      "was gliding along the walls and coming from the Rue Pavée, halt in the\n",
      "recess above which Thénardier was, as it were, suspended. Here this man\n",
      "was joined by a second, who walked with the same caution, then by a\n",
      "third, then by a fourth. When these men were re-united, one of them\n",
      "lifted the latch of the gate in the fence, and all four entered the\n",
      "enclosure in which the shanty stood. They halted directly under\n",
      "Thénardier. These men had evidently chosen this vacant space in order\n",
      "that they might consult without being seen by the passers-by or by the\n",
      "sentinel who guards the wicket of La Force a few paces distant. It must\n",
      "be added, that the rain kept this sentinel blocked in his box.\n",
      "Thénardier, not being able to distinguish their visages, lent an ear to\n",
      "their words with the desperate attention of a wretch who feels himself\n",
      "lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier saw something resembling a gleam of hope flash before his\n",
      "eyes,—these men conversed in slang.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first said in a low but distinct voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s cut. What are we up to here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The second replied: “It’s raining hard enough to put out the very\n",
      "devil’s fire. And the bobbies will be along instanter. There’s a\n",
      "soldier on guard yonder. We shall get nabbed here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These two words, _icigo_ and _icicaille_, both of which mean _ici_, and\n",
      "which belong, the first to the slang of the barriers, the second to the\n",
      "slang of the Temple, were flashes of light for Thénardier. By the\n",
      "_icigo_ he recognized Brujon, who was a prowler of the barriers, by the\n",
      "_icicaille_ he knew Babet, who, among his other trades, had been an\n",
      "old-clothes broker at the Temple.\n",
      "\n",
      "The antique slang of the great century is no longer spoken except in\n",
      "the Temple, and Babet was really the only person who spoke it in all\n",
      "its purity. Had it not been for the _icicaille_, Thénardier would not\n",
      "have recognized him, for he had entirely changed his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile, the third man had intervened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no hurry yet, let’s wait a bit. How do we know that he doesn’t\n",
      "stand in need of us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By this, which was nothing but French, Thénardier recognized\n",
      "Montparnasse, who made it a point in his elegance to understand all\n",
      "slangs and to speak none of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the fourth, he held his peace, but his huge shoulders betrayed\n",
      "him. Thénardier did not hesitate. It was Guelemer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brujon replied almost impetuously but still in a low tone:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are you jabbering about? The tavern-keeper hasn’t managed to cut\n",
      "his stick. He don’t tumble to the racket, that he don’t! You have to be\n",
      "a pretty knowing cove to tear up your shirt, cut up your sheet to make\n",
      "a rope, punch holes in doors, get up false papers, make false keys,\n",
      "file your irons, hang out your cord, hide yourself, and disguise\n",
      "yourself! The old fellow hasn’t managed to play it, he doesn’t\n",
      "understand how to work the business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Babet added, still in that classical slang which was spoken by\n",
      "Poulailler and Cartouche, and which is to the bold, new, highly colored\n",
      "and risky argot used by Brujon what the language of Racine is to the\n",
      "language of André Chenier:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your tavern-keeper must have been nabbed in the act. You have to be\n",
      "knowing. He’s only a greenhorn. He must have let himself be taken in by\n",
      "a bobby, perhaps even by a sheep who played it on him as his pal.\n",
      "Listen, Montparnasse, do you hear those shouts in the prison? You have\n",
      "seen all those lights. He’s recaptured, there! He’ll get off with\n",
      "twenty years. I ain’t afraid, I ain’t a coward, but there ain’t\n",
      "anything more to do, or otherwise they’d lead us a dance. Don’t get\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“One doesn’t desert one’s friends in a scrape,” grumbled Montparnasse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I tell you he’s nabbed!” retorted Brujon. “At the present moment, the\n",
      "inn-keeper ain’t worth a ha’penny. We can’t do nothing for him. Let’s\n",
      "be off. Every minute I think a bobby has got me in his fist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Montparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance; the fact\n",
      "is, that these four men, with the fidelity of ruffians who never\n",
      "abandon each other, had prowled all night long about La Force, great as\n",
      "was their peril, in the hope of seeing Thénardier make his appearance\n",
      "on the top of some wall. But the night, which was really growing too\n",
      "fine,—for the downpour was such as to render all the streets\n",
      "deserted,—the cold which was overpowering them, their soaked garments,\n",
      "their hole-ridden shoes, the alarming noise which had just burst forth\n",
      "in the prison, the hours which had elapsed, the patrol which they had\n",
      "encountered, the hope which was vanishing, all urged them to beat a\n",
      "retreat. Montparnasse himself, who was, perhaps, almost Thénardier’s\n",
      "son-in-law, yielded. A moment more, and they would be gone. Thénardier\n",
      "was panting on his wall like the shipwrecked sufferers of the _Méduse_\n",
      "on their raft when they beheld the vessel which had appeared in sight\n",
      "vanish on the horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dared not call to them; a cry might be heard and ruin everything. An\n",
      "idea occurred to him, a last idea, a flash of inspiration; he drew from\n",
      "his pocket the end of Brujon’s rope, which he had detached from the\n",
      "chimney of the New Building, and flung it into the space enclosed by\n",
      "the fence.\n",
      "\n",
      "This rope fell at their feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A widow,”37 said Babet.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier ran the risk, and spoke:—\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ll warm you up.”\n",

      "\n",
      "An ancient plaster flue, which had served for a stove that had been\n",
      "used in the shanty in former times, ran along the wall and mounted\n",
      "almost to the very spot where they could see Thénardier. This flue,\n",
      "then much damaged and full of cracks, has since fallen, but the marks\n",
      "of it are still visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very narrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One might get up by the help of that,” said Montparnasse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By that flue?” exclaimed Babet, “a grown-up cove, never! it would take\n",
      "a brat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A brat must be got,” resumed Brujon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are we to find a young ’un?” said Guelemer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wait,” said Montparnasse. “I’ve got the very article.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened the gate of the fence very softly, made sure that no one was\n",
      "passing along the street, stepped out cautiously, shut the gate behind\n",
      "him, and set off at a run in the direction of the Bastille.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven or eight minutes elapsed, eight thousand centuries to Thénardier;\n",
      "Babet, Brujon, and Guelemer did not open their lips; at last the gate\n",
      "opened once more, and Montparnasse appeared, breathless, and followed\n",
      "by Gavroche. The rain still rendered the street completely deserted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Gavroche entered the enclosure and gazed at the forms of these\n",
      "ruffians with a tranquil air. The water was dripping from his hair.\n",
      "Guelemer addressed him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you a man, young ’un?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche shrugged his shoulders, and replied:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“A young ’un like me’s a man, and men like you are babes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The brat’s tongue’s well hung!” exclaimed Babet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Paris brat ain’t made of straw,” added Brujon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you want?” asked Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "Montparnasse answered:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Climb up that flue.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With this rope,” said Babet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And fasten it,” continued Brujon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To the top of the wall,” went on Babet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To the cross-bar of the window,” added Brujon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then?” said Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There!” said Guelemer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gamin examined the rope, the flue, the wall, the windows, and made\n",
      "that indescribable and disdainful noise with his lips which signifies:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that all!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s a man up there whom you are to save,” resumed Montparnasse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you?” began Brujon again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Greenhorn!” replied the lad, as though the question appeared a most\n",
      "unprecedented one to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he took off his shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guelemer seized Gavroche by one arm, set him on the roof of the shanty,\n",
      "whose worm-eaten planks bent beneath the urchin’s weight, and handed\n",
      "him the rope which Brujon had knotted together during Montparnasse’s\n",
      "absence. The gamin directed his steps towards the flue, which it was\n",
      "easy to enter, thanks to a large crack which touched the roof. At the\n",
      "moment when he was on the point of ascending, Thénardier, who saw life\n",
      "and safety approaching, bent over the edge of the wall; the first light\n",
      "of dawn struck white upon his brow dripping with sweat, upon his livid\n",
      "cheek-bones, his sharp and savage nose, his bristling gray beard, and\n",
      "Gavroche recognized him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo! it’s my father! Oh, that won’t hinder.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And taking the rope in his teeth, he resolutely began the ascent.\n",
      "\n",
      "He reached the summit of the hut, bestrode the old wall as though it\n",
      "had been a horse, and knotted the rope firmly to the upper cross-bar of\n",
      "the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "A moment later, Thénardier was in the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he touched the pavement, as soon as he found himself out of\n",
      "danger, he was no longer either weary, or chilled or trembling; the\n",
      "terrible things from which he had escaped vanished like smoke, all that\n",
      "strange and ferocious mind awoke once more, and stood erect and free,\n",
      "ready to march onward.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were this man’s first words:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, whom are we to eat?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is useless to explain the sense of this frightfully transparent\n",
      "remark, which signifies both to kill, to assassinate, and to plunder.\n",
      "_To eat_, true sense: _to devour_.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s get well into a corner,” said Brujon. “Let’s settle it in three\n",
      "words, and part at once. There was an affair that promised well in the\n",
      "Rue Plumet, a deserted street, an isolated house, an old rotten gate on\n",
      "a garden, and lone women.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! why not?” demanded Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your girl, Éponine, went to see about the matter,” replied Babet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And she brought a biscuit to Magnon,” added Guelemer. “Nothing to be\n",
      "made there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The girl’s no fool,” said Thénardier. “Still, it must be seen to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes,” said Brujon, “it must be looked up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile, none of the men seemed to see Gavroche, who, during\n",
      "this colloquy, had seated himself on one of the fence-posts; he waited\n",
      "a few moments, thinking that perhaps his father would turn towards him,\n",
      "then he put on his shoes again, and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that all? You don’t want any more, my men? Now you’re out of your\n",
      "scrape. I’m off. I must go and get my brats out of bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And off he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "The five men emerged, one after another, from the enclosure.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the Rue des Ballets,\n",
      "Babet took Thénardier aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you take a good look at that young ’un?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What young ’un?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The one who climbed the wall and carried you the rope.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not particularly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I don’t know, but it strikes me that it was your son.”\n",

      "What is slang? It is at one and the same time, a nation and a dialect;\n",
      "it is theft in its two kinds; people and language.\n",

      "When, four and thirty years ago, the narrator of this grave and sombre\n",
      "history introduced into a work written with the same aim as this39 a\n",
      "thief who talked argot, there arose amazement and clamor.—“What! How!\n",

      "\n",
      "We have never understood this sort of objections.\n",

      "Since that time, two powerful romancers, one of whom is a profound\n",

      "When it is a question of probing a wound, a gulf, a society, since when\n",

      "have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act, and, at\n",
      "least, a simple and useful deed, worthy of the sympathetic attention\n",
      "which duty accepted and fulfilled merits. Why should one not explore\n",
      "everything, and study everything? Why should one halt on the way? The\n",

      "nudity, in the broad light of thought, of the horrible swarming of\n",
      "slang. It seems, in fact, to be a sort of horrible beast made for the\n",

      "beholds a frightful, living, and bristling thicket which quivers,\n",

      "prefect, the minister, _pharos_; the devil, _le rabouin_. Nothing is\n",
      "stranger than these words which both mask and reveal. Some, _le\n",

      "produce on you the effect of a cyclopean grimace.\n",

      "In the second place, metaphor. The peculiarity of a language which is\n",
      "desirous of saying all yet concealing all is that it is rich in\n",
      "figures. Metaphor is an enigma, wherein the thief who is plotting a\n",
      "stroke, the prisoner who is arranging an escape, take refuge. No idiom\n",
      "is more metaphorical than slang: _dévisser le coco_ (to unscrew the\n",
      "nut), to twist the neck; _tortiller_ (to wriggle), to eat; _être\n",
      "gerbé_, to be tried; _a rat_, a bread thief; _il lansquine_, it rains,\n",
      "a striking, ancient figure which partly bears its date about it, which\n",
      "assimilates long oblique lines of rain, with the dense and slanting\n",
      "pikes of the lancers, and which compresses into a single word the\n",
      "popular expression: it rains halberds. Sometimes, in proportion as\n",
      "slang progresses from the first epoch to the second, words pass from\n",
      "the primitive and savage sense to the metaphorical sense. The devil\n",
      "ceases to be _le rabouin_, and becomes _le boulanger_ (the baker), who\n",
      "puts the bread into the oven. This is more witty, but less grand,\n",
      "something like Racine after Corneille, like Euripides after Æschylus.\n",
      "Certain slang phrases which participate in the two epochs and have at\n",
      "once the barbaric character and the metaphorical character resemble\n",
      "phantasmagories. _Les sorgueuers vont solliciter des gails à la\n",
      "lune_—the prowlers are going to steal horses by night,—this passes\n",
      "before the mind like a group of spectres. One knows not what one sees.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the third place, the expedient. Slang lives on the language. It uses\n",
      "it in accordance with its fancy, it dips into it hap-hazard, and it\n",
      "often confines itself, when occasion arises, to alter it in a gross and\n",
      "summary fashion. Occasionally, with the ordinary words thus deformed\n",
      "and complicated with words of pure slang, picturesque phrases are\n",
      "formed, in which there can be felt the mixture of the two preceding\n",
      "elements, the direct creation and the metaphor: _le cab jaspine, je\n",
      "marronne que la roulotte de Pantin trime dans le sabri_, the dog is\n",
      "barking, I suspect that the diligence for Paris is passing through the\n",
      "woods. _Le dab est sinve, la dabuge est merloussière, la fée est\n",
      "bative_, the bourgeois is stupid, the bourgeoise is cunning, the\n",
      "daughter is pretty. Generally, to throw listeners off the track, slang\n",
      "confines itself to adding to all the words of the language without\n",
      "distinction, an ignoble tail, a termination in _aille_, in _orgue_, in\n",
      "_iergue_, or in _uche_. Thus: _Vousiergue trouvaille bonorgue ce\n",
      "gigotmuche?_ Do you think that leg of mutton good? A phrase addressed\n",
      "by Cartouche to a turnkey in order to find out whether the sum offered\n",
      "for his escape suited him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The termination in _mar_ has been added recently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slang, being the dialect of corruption, quickly becomes corrupted\n",
      "itself. Besides this, as it is always seeking concealment, as soon as\n",
      "it feels that it is understood, it changes its form. Contrary to what\n",
      "happens with every other vegetation, every ray of light which falls\n",
      "upon it kills whatever it touches. Thus slang is in constant process of\n",
      "decomposition and recomposition; an obscure and rapid work which never\n",
      "pauses. It passes over more ground in ten years than a language in ten\n",
      "centuries. Thus _le larton_ (bread) becomes _le lartif; le gail_\n",
      "(horse) becomes _le gaye; la fertanche_ (straw) becomes _la fertille;\n",

      "Still, from time to time, and in consequence of this very movement, the\n",

      "If the philosopher succeeds in fixing, for a moment, for purposes of\n",

      "more fecund in instruction. There is not a metaphor, not an analogy, in\n",

      "Let him listen to what follows:—\n",
      "\n",
      "There existed at the Châtelet in Paris a large and long cellar. This\n",
      "cellar was eight feet below the level of the Seine. It had neither\n",
      "windows nor air-holes, its only aperture was the door; men could enter\n",
      "there, air could not. This vault had for ceiling a vault of stone, and\n",
      "for floor ten inches of mud. It was flagged; but the pavement had\n",
      "rotted and cracked under the oozing of the water. Eight feet above the\n",
      "floor, a long and massive beam traversed this subterranean excavation\n",
      "from side to side; from this beam hung, at short distances apart,\n",
      "chains three feet long, and at the end of these chains there were rings\n",
      "for the neck. In this vault, men who had been condemned to the galleys\n",
      "were incarcerated until the day of their departure for Toulon. They\n",
      "were thrust under this beam, where each one found his fetters swinging\n",
      "in the darkness and waiting for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chains, those pendant arms, and the necklets, those open hands,\n",
      "caught the unhappy wretches by the throat. They were rivetted and left\n",
      "there. As the chain was too short, they could not lie down. They\n",
      "remained motionless in that cavern, in that night, beneath that beam,\n",
      "almost hanging, forced to unheard-of efforts to reach their bread, jug,\n",
      "or their vault overhead, mud even to mid-leg, filth flowing to their\n",
      "very calves, broken asunder with fatigue, with thighs and knees giving\n",
      "way, clinging fast to the chain with their hands in order to obtain\n",
      "some rest, unable to sleep except when standing erect, and awakened\n",
      "every moment by the strangling of the collar; some woke no more. In\n",
      "order to eat, they pushed the bread, which was flung to them in the\n",
      "mud, along their leg with their heel until it reached their hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long did they remain thus? One month, two months, six months\n",
      "sometimes; one stayed a year. It was the antechamber of the galleys.\n",
      "Men were put there for stealing a hare from the king. In this\n",
      "sepulchre-hell, what did they do? What man can do in a sepulchre, they\n",
      "went through the agonies of death, and what can man do in hell, they\n",
      "sang; for song lingers where there is no longer any hope. In the waters\n",
      "of Malta, when a galley was approaching, the song could be heard before\n",
      "the sound of the oars. Poor Survincent, the poacher, who had gone\n",
      "through the prison-cellar of the Châtelet, said: “It was the rhymes\n",
      "that kept me up.” Uselessness of poetry. What is the good of rhyme?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is in this cellar that nearly all the slang songs had their birth.\n",
      "It is from the dungeon of the Grand-Châtelet of Paris that comes the\n",
      "melancholy refrain of the Montgomery galley: _“Timaloumisaine,\n",
      "timaloumison.”_ The majority of these songs are melancholy; some are\n",
      "gay; one is tender:—\n",
      "\n",
      "    Icicaille est la theatre\n",
      "    Du petit dardant.\n",

      "Do what you will, you cannot annihilate that eternal relic in the heart\n",
      "of man, love.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this world of dismal deeds, people keep their secrets. The secret is\n",
      "the thing above all others. The secret, in the eyes of these wretches,\n",
      "is unity which serves as a base of union. To betray a secret is to tear\n",
      "from each member of this fierce community something of his own\n",
      "personality. To inform against, in the energetic slang dialect, is\n",
      "called: “to eat the bit.” As though the informer drew to himself a\n",
      "little of the substance of all and nourished himself on a bit of each\n",
      "one’s flesh.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does it signify to receive a box on the ear? Commonplace metaphor\n",
      "replies: “It is to see thirty-six candles.” Here slang intervenes and\n",
      "takes it up: Candle, _camoufle_. Thereupon, the ordinary tongue gives\n",
      "_camouflet_42 as the synonym for _soufflet_. Thus, by a sort of\n",
      "infiltration from below upwards, with the aid of metaphor, that\n",
      "incalculable, trajectory slang mounts from the cavern to the Academy;\n",
      "and Poulailler saying: “I light my _camoufle_,” causes Voltaire to\n",
      "write: “Langleviel La Beaumelle deserves a hundred _camouflets_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Researches in slang mean discoveries at every step. Study and\n",

      "\n",
      "As the reader perceives, slang in its entirety, slang of four hundred\n",
      "years ago, like the slang of to-day, is permeated with that sombre,\n",
      "symbolical spirit which gives to all words a mien which is now\n",
      "mournful, now menacing. One feels in it the wild and ancient sadness of\n",
      "those vagrants of the Court of Miracles who played at cards with packs\n",
      "of their own, some of which have come down to us. The eight of clubs,\n",
      "for instance, represented a huge tree bearing eight enormous trefoil\n",
      "leaves, a sort of fantastic personification of the forest. At the foot\n",
      "of this tree a fire was burning, over which three hares were roasting a\n",
      "huntsman on a spit, and behind him, on another fire, hung a steaming\n",
      "pot, whence emerged the head of a dog. Nothing can be more melancholy\n",
      "than these reprisals in painting, by a pack of cards, in the presence\n",
      "of stakes for the roasting of smugglers and of the cauldron for the\n",
      "boiling of counterfeiters. The diverse forms assumed by thought in the\n",
      "realm of slang, even song, even raillery, even menace, all partook of\n",
      "this powerless and dejected character. All the songs, the melodies of\n",
      "some of which have been collected, were humble and lamentable to the\n",
      "point of evoking tears. The _pègre_ is always the poor _pègre_, and he\n",
      "is always the hare in hiding, the fugitive mouse, the flying bird. He\n",
      "hardly complains, he contents himself with sighing; one of his moans\n",
      "has come down to us: “I do not understand how God, the father of men,\n",
      "can torture his children and his grandchildren and hear them cry,\n",
      "without himself suffering torture.”43 The wretch, whenever he has time\n",
      "to think, makes himself small before the low, and frail in the presence\n",
      "of society; he lies down flat on his face, he entreats, he appeals to\n",
      "the side of compassion; we feel that he is conscious of his guilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the middle of the last century a change took place, prison\n",
      "songs and thieves’ ritournelles assumed, so to speak, an insolent and\n",
      "jovial mien. The plaintive _maluré_ was replaced by the _larifla_. We\n",
      "find in the eighteenth century, in nearly all the songs of the galleys\n",
      "and prisons, a diabolical and enigmatical gayety. We hear this strident\n",
      "and lilting refrain which we should say had been lighted up by a\n",
      "phosphorescent gleam, and which seems to have been flung into the\n",
      "forest by a will-o’-the-wisp playing the fife:—\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was sung in a cellar or in a nook of the forest while cutting a\n",
      "man’s throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "A serious symptom. In the eighteenth century, the ancient melancholy of\n",
      "the dejected classes vanishes. They began to laugh. They rally the\n",
      "_grand meg_ and the _grand dab_. Given Louis XV. they call the King of\n",
      "France “le Marquis de Pantin.” And behold, they are almost gay. A sort\n",
      "of gleam proceeds from these miserable wretches, as though their\n",
      "consciences were not heavy within them any more. These lamentable\n",
      "tribes of darkness have no longer merely the desperate audacity of\n",
      "actions, they possess the heedless audacity of mind. A sign that they\n",
      "are losing the sense of their criminality, and that they feel, even\n",
      "among thinkers and dreamers, some indefinable support which the latter\n",
      "themselves know not of. A sign that theft and pillage are beginning to\n",
      "filter into doctrines and sophisms, in such a way as to lose somewhat\n",
      "of their ugliness, while communicating much of it to sophisms and\n",
      "doctrines. A sign, in short, of some outbreak which is prodigious and\n",
      "near unless some diversion shall arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us pause a moment. Whom are we accusing here? Is it the eighteenth\n",
      "century? Is it philosophy? Certainly not. The work of the eighteenth\n",
      "century is healthy and good and wholesome. The encyclopedists, Diderot\n",
      "at their head; the physiocrates, Turgot at their head; the\n",
      "philosophers, Voltaire at their head; the Utopians, Rousseau at their\n",
      "head,—these are four sacred legions. Humanity’s immense advance towards\n",
      "the light is due to them. They are the four vanguards of the human\n",
      "race, marching towards the four cardinal points of progress. Diderot\n",
      "towards the beautiful, Turgot towards the useful, Voltaire towards the\n",
      "true, Rousseau towards the just. But by the side of and above the\n",
      "philosophers, there were the sophists, a venomous vegetation mingled\n",
      "with a healthy growth, hemlock in the virgin forest. While the\n",
      "executioner was burning the great books of the liberators of the\n",
      "century on the grand staircase of the court-house, writers now\n",
      "forgotten were publishing, with the King’s sanction, no one knows what\n",
      "strangely disorganizing writings, which were eagerly read by the\n",
      "unfortunate. Some of these publications, odd to say, which were\n",
      "patronized by a prince, are to be found in the Secret Library. These\n",
      "facts, significant but unknown, were imperceptible on the surface.\n",
      "Sometimes, in the very obscurity of a fact lurks its danger. It is\n",
      "obscure because it is underhand. Of all these writers, the one who\n",
      "probably then excavated in the masses the most unhealthy gallery was\n",
      "Restif de La Bretonne.\n",
      "\n",
      "This work, peculiar to the whole of Europe, effected more ravages in\n",
      "Germany than anywhere else. In Germany, during a given period, summed\n",
      "up by Schiller in his famous drama _The Robbers_, theft and pillage\n",
      "rose up in protest against property and labor, assimilated certain\n",
      "specious and false elementary ideas, which, though just in appearance,\n",
      "were absurd in reality, enveloped themselves in these ideas,\n",
      "disappeared within them, after a fashion, assumed an abstract name,\n",
      "passed into the state of theory, and in that shape circulated among the\n",
      "laborious, suffering, and honest masses, unknown even to the imprudent\n",
      "chemists who had prepared the mixture, unknown even to the masses who\n",
      "accepted it. Whenever a fact of this sort presents itself, the case is\n",
      "grave. Suffering engenders wrath; and while the prosperous classes\n",
      "blind themselves or fall asleep, which is the same thing as shutting\n",
      "one’s eyes, the hatred of the unfortunate classes lights its torch at\n",
      "some aggrieved or ill-made spirit which dreams in a corner, and sets\n",
      "itself to the scrutiny of society. The scrutiny of hatred is a terrible\n",
      "thing.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This made both of them laugh the whole evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle of another conversation, he chanced to exclaim:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! One day, at the Luxembourg, I had a good mind to finish breaking\n",
      "up a veteran!” But he stopped short, and went no further. He would have\n",
      "been obliged to speak to Cosette of her garter, and that was\n",
      "impossible. This bordered on a strange theme, the flesh, before which\n",
      "that immense and innocent love recoiled with a sort of sacred fright.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius pictured life with Cosette to himself like this, without\n",
      "anything else; to come every evening to the Rue Plumet, to displace the\n",
      "old and accommodating bar of the chief-justice’s gate, to sit elbow to\n",
      "elbow on that bench, to gaze through the trees at the scintillation of\n",
      "the on-coming night, to fit a fold of the knee of his trousers into the\n",
      "ample fall of Cosette’s gown, to caress her thumb-nail, to call her\n",
      "_thou_, to smell of the same flower, one after the other, forever,\n",
      "indefinitely. During this time, clouds passed above their heads. Every\n",
      "time that the wind blows it bears with it more of the dreams of men\n",
      "than of the clouds of heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "This chaste, almost shy love was not devoid of gallantry, by any means.\n",
      "To pay compliments to the woman whom a man loves is the first method of\n",
      "bestowing caresses, and he is half audacious who tries it. A compliment\n",
      "is something like a kiss through a veil. Voluptuousness mingles there\n",
      "with its sweet tiny point, while it hides itself. The heart draws back\n",
      "before voluptuousness only to love the more. Marius’ blandishments, all\n",
      "saturated with fancy, were, so to speak, of azure hue. The birds when\n",
      "they fly up yonder, in the direction of the angels, must hear such\n",
      "words. There were mingled with them, nevertheless, life, humanity, all\n",
      "the positiveness of which Marius was capable. It was what is said in\n",
      "the bower, a prelude to what will be said in the chamber; a lyrical\n",
      "effusion, strophe and sonnet intermingled, pleasing hyperboles of\n",
      "cooing, all the refinements of adoration arranged in a bouquet and\n",
      "exhaling a celestial perfume, an ineffable twitter of heart to heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” murmured Marius, “how beautiful you are! I dare not look at you.\n",
      "It is all over with me when I contemplate you. You are a grace. I know\n",
      "not what is the matter with me. The hem of your gown, when the tip of\n",
      "your shoe peeps from beneath, upsets me. And then, what an enchanted\n",
      "gleam when you open your thought even but a little! You talk\n",
      "astonishingly good sense. It seems to me at times that you are a dream.\n",
      "Speak, I listen, I admire. Oh Cosette! how strange it is and how\n",
      "charming! I am really beside myself. You are adorable, Mademoiselle. I\n",
      "study your feet with the microscope and your soul with the telescope.”\n",
      "\n",

      "Cosette’s whole person was ingenuousness, ingenuity, transparency,\n",

      "\n",
      "It was quite simple that Marius should admire her, since he adored her.\n",
      "But the truth is, that this little school-girl, fresh from the convent,\n",
      "talked with exquisite penetration and uttered, at times, all sorts of\n",
      "true and delicate sayings. Her prattle was conversation. She never made\n",
      "a mistake about anything, and she saw things justly. The woman feels\n",
      "and speaks with the tender instinct of the heart, which is infallible.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one understands so well as a woman, how to say things that are, at\n",
      "once, both sweet and deep. Sweetness and depth, they are the whole of\n",
      "woman; in them lies the whole of heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this full felicity, tears welled up to their eyes every instant. A\n",
      "crushed lady-bug, a feather fallen from a nest, a branch of hawthorn\n",
      "broken, aroused their pity, and their ecstasy, sweetly mingled with\n",
      "melancholy, seemed to ask nothing better than to weep. The most\n",
      "sovereign symptom of love is a tenderness that is, at times, almost\n",
      "unbearable.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, in addition to this,—all these contradictions are the lightning\n",
      "play of love,—they were fond of laughing, they laughed readily and with\n",

      "the air of two boys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, though unknown to hearts intoxicated with purity, nature is\n",
      "always present and will not be forgotten. She is there with her brutal\n",

      "one feels in the most modest private interview, the adorable and\n",
      "mysterious shade which separates a couple of lovers from a pair of\n",

      "\n",
      "Cosette, who was rather less dreamy than Marius, was gay, and that\n",
      "sufficed for Jean Valjean’s happiness. The thoughts which Cosette\n",
      "cherished, her tender preoccupations, Marius’ image which filled her\n",
      "heart, took away nothing from the incomparable purity of her beautiful,\n",
      "chaste, and smiling brow. She was at the age when the virgin bears her\n",

      "two lovers have come to an understanding, things always go well; the\n",
      "third party who might disturb their love is kept in a state of perfect\n",
      "blindness by a restricted number of precautions which are always the\n",
      "same in the case of all lovers. Thus, Cosette never objected to any of\n",
      "Jean Valjean’s proposals. Did she want to take a walk? “Yes, dear\n",
      "little father.” Did she want to stay at home? Very good. Did he wish to\n",
      "pass the evening with Cosette? She was delighted. As he always went to\n",
      "bed at ten o’clock, Marius did not come to the garden on such occasions\n",
      "until after that hour, when, from the street, he heard Cosette open the\n",
      "long glass door on the veranda. Of course, no one ever met Marius in\n",
      "the daytime. Jean Valjean never even dreamed any longer that Marius was\n",
      "in existence. Only once, one morning, he chanced to say to Cosette:\n",
      "“Why, you have whitewash on your back!” On the previous evening,\n",
      "Marius, in a transport, had pushed Cosette against the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Toussaint, who retired early, thought of nothing but her sleep, and\n",
      "was as ignorant of the whole matter as Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius never set foot in the house. When he was with Cosette, they hid\n",
      "themselves in a recess near the steps, in order that they might neither\n",
      "be seen nor heard from the street, and there they sat, frequently\n",
      "contenting themselves, by way of conversation, with pressing each\n",
      "other’s hands twenty times a minute as they gazed at the branches of\n",
      "the trees. At such times, a thunderbolt might have fallen thirty paces\n",
      "from them, and they would not have noticed it, so deeply was the\n",
      "reverie of the one absorbed and sunk in the reverie of the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limpid purity. Hours wholly white; almost all alike. This sort of love\n",
      "is a recollection of lily petals and the plumage of the dove.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole extent of the garden lay between them and the street. Every\n",
      "time that Marius entered and left, he carefully adjusted the bar of the\n",
      "gate in such a manner that no displacement was visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "He usually went away about midnight, and returned to Courfeyrac’s\n",
      "lodgings. Courfeyrac said to Bahorel:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you believe it? Marius comes home nowadays at one o’clock in the\n",
      "morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "“What do you expect? There’s always a petard in a seminary fellow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At times, Courfeyrac folded his arms, assumed a serious air, and said\n",
      "to Marius:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are getting irregular in your habits, young man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Courfeyrac, being a practical man, did not take in good part this\n",
      "reflection of an invisible paradise upon Marius; he was not much in the\n",
      "habit of concealed passions; it made him impatient, and now and then he\n",
      "called upon Marius to come back to reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, he threw him this admonition:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear fellow, you produce upon me the effect of being located in the\n",
      "moon, the realm of dreams, the province of illusions, capital,\n",
      "soap-bubble. Come, be a good boy, what’s her name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But nothing could induce Marius “to talk.” They might have torn out his\n",
      "nails before one of the two sacred syllables of which that ineffable\n",
      "name, Cosette, was composed. True love is as luminous as the dawn and\n",
      "as silent as the tomb. Only, Courfeyrac saw this change in Marius, that\n",
      "his taciturnity was of the beaming order.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this sweet month of May, Marius and Cosette learned to know\n",
      "these immense delights. To dispute and to say _you_ for _thou_, simply\n",
      "that they might say _thou_ the better afterwards. To talk at great\n",
      "length with very minute details, of persons in whom they took not the\n",
      "slightest interest in the world; another proof that in that ravishing\n",
      "opera called love, the libretto counts for almost nothing;\n",
      "\n",
      "For Marius, to listen to Cosette discussing finery;\n",
      "\n",
      "For Cosette, to listen to Marius talk in politics;\n",
      "\n",
      "To listen, knee pressed to knee, to the carriages rolling along the Rue\n",
      "de Babylone;\n",
      "\n",
      "To gaze upon the same planet in space, or at the same glowworm gleaming\n",
      "in the grass;\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In the meantime, divers complications were approaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening, Marius was on his way to the rendezvous, by way of the\n",
      "Boulevard des Invalides. He habitually walked with drooping head. As he\n",
      "was on the point of turning the corner of the Rue Plumet, he heard some\n",
      "one quite close to him say:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good evening, Monsieur Marius.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He raised his head and recognized Éponine.\n",
      "\n",
      "This produced a singular effect upon him. He had not thought of that\n",
      "girl a single time since the day when she had conducted him to the Rue\n",
      "Plumet, he had not seen her again, and she had gone completely out of\n",
      "his mind. He had no reasons for anything but gratitude towards her, he\n",
      "owed her his happiness, and yet, it was embarrassing to him to meet\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is an error to think that passion, when it is pure and happy, leads\n",
      "man to a state of perfection; it simply leads him, as we have noted, to\n",
      "a state of oblivion. In this situation, man forgets to be bad, but he\n",
      "also forgets to be good. Gratitude, duty, matters essential and\n",
      "important to be remembered, vanish. At any other time, Marius would\n",
      "have behaved quite differently to Éponine. Absorbed in Cosette, he had\n",
      "not even clearly put it to himself that this Éponine was named Éponine\n",
      "Thénardier, and that she bore the name inscribed in his father’s will,\n",
      "that name, for which, but a few months before, he would have so\n",
      "ardently sacrificed himself. We show Marius as he was. His father\n",
      "himself was fading out of his soul to some extent, under the splendor\n",
      "of his love.\n",
      "\n",
      "He replied with some embarrassment:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! so it’s you, Éponine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why do you call me _you?_ Have I done anything to you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he had nothing against her. Far from it. Only, he felt that\n",
      "he could not do otherwise, now that he used _thou_ to Cosette, than say\n",
      "_you_ to Éponine.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he remained silent, she exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she paused. It seemed as though words failed that creature\n",
      "formerly so heedless and so bold. She tried to smile and could not.\n",
      "Then she resumed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she paused again, and remained with downcast eyes.\n",

      "She approached the railing, felt of the bars one after the other, and\n",
      "readily recognized the one which Marius had moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "She murmured in a low voice and in gloomy accents:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“None of that, Lisette!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She seated herself on the underpinning of the railing, close beside the\n",
      "bar, as though she were guarding it. It was precisely at the point\n",
      "where the railing touched the neighboring wall. There was a dim nook\n",
      "there, in which Éponine was entirely concealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She remained thus for more than an hour, without stirring and without\n",
      "breathing, a prey to her thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards ten o’clock in the evening, one of the two or three persons who\n",
      "passed through the Rue Plumet, an old, belated bourgeois who was making\n",
      "haste to escape from this deserted spot of evil repute, as he skirted\n",
      "the garden railings and reached the angle which it made with the wall,\n",
      "heard a dull and threatening voice saying:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m no longer surprised that he comes here every evening.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The passer-by cast a glance around him, saw no one, dared not peer into\n",
      "the black niche, and was greatly alarmed. He redoubled his pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "This passer-by had reason to make haste, for a very few instants later,\n",
      "six men, who were marching separately and at some distance from each\n",
      "other, along the wall, and who might have been taken for a gray patrol,\n",
      "entered the Rue Plumet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first to arrive at the garden railing halted, and waited for the\n",
      "others; a second later, all six were reunited.\n",
      "\n",
      "These men began to talk in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is the place,” said one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there a _cab_ [dog] in the garden?” asked another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know. In any case, I have fetched a ball that we’ll make him\n",
      "eat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you some putty to break the pane with?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The railing is old,” interpolated a fifth, who had the voice of a\n",
      "ventriloquist.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So much the better,” said the second who had spoken. “It won’t screech\n",
      "under the saw, and it won’t be hard to cut.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The sixth, who had not yet opened his lips, now began to inspect the\n",
      "gate, as Éponine had done an hour earlier, grasping each bar in\n",
      "succession, and shaking them cautiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus he came to the bar which Marius had loosened. As he was on the\n",
      "point of grasping this bar, a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness,\n",
      "fell upon his arm; he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a push in\n",
      "the middle of his breast, and a hoarse voice said to him, but not\n",
      "loudly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s a dog.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same moment, he perceived a pale girl standing before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings. He\n",
      "bristled up in hideous wise; nothing is so formidable to behold as\n",
      "ferocious beasts who are uneasy; their terrified air evokes terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "He recoiled and stammered:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What jade is this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your daughter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, in fact, Éponine, who had addressed Thénardier.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the apparition of Éponine, the other five, that is to say,\n",
      "Claquesous, Guelemer, Babet, Brujon, and Montparnasse had noiselessly\n",
      "drawn near, without precipitation, without uttering a word, with the\n",
      "sinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands.\n",
      "Guelemer held one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers call\n",
      "_fanchons_.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, see here, what are you about there? What do you want with us? Are\n",
      "you crazy?” exclaimed Thénardier, as loudly as one can exclaim and\n",
      "still speak low; “what have you come here to hinder our work for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Éponine burst out laughing, and threw herself on his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am here, little father, because I am here. Isn’t a person allowed to\n",
      "sit on the stones nowadays? It’s you who ought not to be here. What\n",
      "have you come here for, since it’s a biscuit? I told Magnon so. There’s\n",
      "nothing to be done here. But embrace me, my good little father! It’s a\n",
      "long time since I’ve seen you! So you’re out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier tried to disentangle himself from Éponine’s arms, and\n",
      "grumbled:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s good. You’ve embraced me. Yes, I’m out. I’m not in. Now, get\n",
      "away with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But Éponine did not release her hold, and redoubled her caresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how did you manage it, little pa? You must have been very clever\n",
      "to get out of that. Tell me about it! And my mother? Where is mother?\n",
      "Tell me about mamma.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier replied:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s well. I don’t know, let me alone, and be off, I tell you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won’t go, so there now,” pouted Éponine like a spoiled child; “you\n",
      "send me off, and it’s four months since I saw you, and I’ve hardly had\n",
      "time to kiss you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And she caught her father round the neck again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, now, this is stupid!” said Babet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Make haste!” said Guelemer, “the cops may pass.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The ventriloquist’s voice repeated his distich:—\n",
      "\n",
      "    “Nous n’ sommes pas le jour de l’an,\n",
      "    A bécoter papa, maman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "    “This isn’t New Year’s day\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Why, it’s Monsieur Brujon. Good day, Monsieur Babet. Good day,\n",

      "Montparnasse?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, they know you!” ejaculated Thénardier. “But good day, good\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the hour for foxes, not for chickens,” said Montparnasse.\n",

      "“You see the job we have on hand here,” added Babet.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“My little Montparnasse,” responded Éponine very gently, “you must have\n",
      "confidence in people. I am the daughter of my father, perhaps. Monsieur\n",
      "Babet, Monsieur Guelemer, I’m the person who was charged to investigate\n",
      "this matter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is remarkable that Éponine did not talk slang. That frightful tongue\n",
      "had become impossible to her since she had known Marius.\n",
      "\n",
      "She pressed in her hand, small, bony, and feeble as that of a skeleton,\n",
      "Guelemer’s huge, coarse fingers, and continued:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know well that I’m no fool. Ordinarily, I am believed. I have\n",
      "rendered you service on various occasions. Well, I have made inquiries;\n",
      "you will expose yourselves to no purpose, you see. I swear to you that\n",
      "there is nothing in this house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are lone women,” said Guelemer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, the persons have moved away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The candles haven’t, anyway!” ejaculated Babet.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he pointed out to Éponine, across the tops of the trees, a light\n",
      "which was wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion. It was\n",
      "Toussaint, who had stayed up to spread out some linen to dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Éponine made a final effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said she, “they’re very poor folks, and it’s a hovel where\n",
      "there isn’t a sou.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go to the devil!” cried Thénardier. “When we’ve turned the house\n",
      "upside down and put the cellar at the top and the attic below, we’ll\n",
      "tell you what there is inside, and whether it’s francs or sous or\n",
      "half-farthings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he pushed her aside with the intention of entering.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My good friend, Mr. Montparnasse,” said Éponine, “I entreat you, you\n",
      "are a good fellow, don’t enter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take care, you’ll cut yourself,” replied Montparnasse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier resumed in his decided tone:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Decamp, my girl, and leave men to their own affairs!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Éponine released Montparnasse’s hand, which she had grasped again, and\n",
      "said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you mean to enter this house?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rather!” grinned the ventriloquist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she set her back against the gate, faced the six ruffians who were\n",
      "armed to the teeth, and to whom the night lent the visages of demons,\n",
      "and said in a firm, low voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I don’t mean that you shall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They halted in amazement. The ventriloquist, however, finished his\n",
      "grin. She went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Friends! Listen well. This is not what you want. Now I’m talking. In\n",
      "the first place, if you enter this garden, if you lay a hand on this\n",
      "gate, I’ll scream, I’ll beat on the door, I’ll rouse everybody, I’ll\n",
      "have the whole six of you seized, I’ll call the police.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’d do it, too,” said Thénardier in a low tone to Brujon and the\n",
      "ventriloquist.\n",
      "\n",
      "She shook her head and added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beginning with my father!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier stepped nearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not so close, my good man!” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "He retreated, growling between his teeth:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, what’s the matter with her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bitch!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She began to laugh in a terrible way:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“As you like, but you shall not enter here. I’m not the daughter of a\n",
      "dog, since I’m the daughter of a wolf. There are six of you, what\n",
      "matters that to me? You are men. Well, I’m a woman. You don’t frighten\n",
      "me. I tell you that you shan’t enter this house, because it doesn’t\n",
      "suit me. If you approach, I’ll bark. I told you, I’m the dog, and I\n",
      "don’t care a straw for you. Go your way, you bore me! Go where you\n",
      "please, but don’t come here, I forbid it! You can use your knives. I’ll\n",
      "use kicks; it’s all the same to me, come on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She advanced a pace nearer the ruffians, she was terrible, she burst\n",
      "out laughing:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardine! I’m not afraid. I shall be hungry this summer, and I shall be\n",
      "cold this winter. Aren’t they ridiculous, these ninnies of men, to\n",
      "think they can scare a girl! What! Scare? Oh, yes, much! Because you\n",
      "have finical poppets of mistresses who hide under the bed when you put\n",
      "on a big voice, forsooth! I ain’t afraid of anything, that I ain’t!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She fastened her intent gaze upon Thénardier and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not even of you, father!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she continued, as she cast her blood-shot, spectre-like eyes upon\n",
      "the ruffians in turn:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do I care if I’m picked up to-morrow morning on the pavement of\n",
      "the Rue Plumet, killed by the blows of my father’s club, or whether I’m\n",
      "found a year from now in the nets at Saint-Cloud or the Isle of Swans\n",
      "in the midst of rotten old corks and drowned dogs?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She was forced to pause; she was seized by a dry cough, her breath came\n",
      "from her weak and narrow chest like the death-rattle.\n",
      "\n",
      "She resumed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have only to cry out, and people will come, and then slap, bang!\n",
      "There are six of you; I represent the whole world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thénardier made a movement towards her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t approach!” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "He halted, and said gently:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, no; I won’t approach, but don’t speak so loud. So you intend to\n",
      "hinder us in our work, my daughter? But we must earn our living all the\n",
      "same. Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Burst!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, she seated herself on the underpinning of the fence and\n",
      "hummed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "    “Mon bras si dodu,\n",
      "    Ma jambe bien faite\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She had set her elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand, and she\n",
      "swung her foot with an air of indifference. Her tattered gown permitted\n",
      "a view of her thin shoulder-blades. The neighboring street lantern\n",
      "illuminated her profile and her attitude. Nothing more resolute and\n",
      "more surprising could be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The six rascals, speechless and gloomy at being held in check by a\n",
      "girl, retreated beneath the shadow cast by the lantern, and held\n",
      "counsel with furious and humiliated shrugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime she stared at them with a stern but peaceful air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s something the matter with her,” said Babet. “A reason. Is she\n",
      "in love with the dog? It’s a shame to miss this, anyway. Two women, an\n",
      "old fellow who lodges in the back-yard, and curtains that ain’t so bad\n",

      "He flashed the knife, which he held open in his hand, in the light of\n",
      "the lantern.\n",

      "\n",
      "Brujon, who was somewhat of an oracle, and who had, as the reader\n",
      "knows, “put up the job,” had not as yet spoken. He seemed thoughtful.\n",
      "He had the reputation of not sticking at anything, and it was known\n",
      "that he had plundered a police post simply out of bravado. Besides this\n",
      "he made verses and songs, which gave him great authority.\n",

      "\n",
      "“See here; this morning I came across two sparrows fighting, this\n",

      "After the departure of the ruffians, the Rue Plumet resumed its\n",
      "tranquil, nocturnal aspect. That which had just taken place in this\n",
      "street would not have astonished a forest. The lofty trees, the copses,\n",
      "the heaths, the branches rudely interlaced, the tall grass, exist in a\n",
      "sombre manner; the savage swarming there catches glimpses of sudden\n",
      "apparitions of the invisible; that which is below man distinguishes,\n",
      "through the mists, that which is beyond man; and the things of which we\n",
      "living beings are ignorant there meet face to face in the night.\n",
      "Nature, bristling and wild, takes alarm at certain approaches in which\n",
      "she fancies that she feels the supernatural. The forces of the gloom\n",
      "know each other, and are strangely balanced by each other. Teeth and\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "tremblingly took his place beside her, she had continued:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness, because he\n",

      "\n",
      "For the last six weeks, Marius had little by little, slowly, by\n",
      "degrees, taken possession of Cosette each day. As we have already\n",
      "explained, in the case of first love, the soul is taken long before the\n",
      "body; later on, one takes the body long before the soul; sometimes one\n",
      "does not take the soul at all; the Faublas and the Prudhommes add:\n",
      "“Because there is none”; but the sarcasm is, fortunately, a blasphemy.\n",
      "So Marius possessed Cosette, as spirits possess, but he enveloped her\n",
      "with all his soul, and seized her jealously with incredible conviction.\n",
      "He possessed her smile, her breath, her perfume, the profound radiance\n",
      "of her blue eyes, the sweetness of her skin when he touched her hand,\n",
      "the charming mark which she had on her neck, all her thoughts.\n",

      "\n",
      "He incessantly gazed at, and he sometimes touched lightly with his\n",
      "breath, the short locks on the nape of her neck, and he declared to\n",
      "himself that there was not one of those short hairs which did not\n",
      "belong to him, Marius. He gazed upon and adored the things that she\n",
      "wore, her knot of ribbon, her gloves, her sleeves, her shoes, her\n",
      "cuffs, as sacred objects of which he was the master. He dreamed that he\n",
      "was the lord of those pretty shell combs which she wore in her hair,\n",
      "and he even said to himself, in confused and suppressed stammerings of\n",
      "voluptuousness which did not make their way to the light, that there\n",
      "was not a ribbon of her gown, not a mesh in her stockings, not a fold\n",
      "in her bodice, which was not his. Beside Cosette he felt himself beside\n",
      "his own property, his own thing, his own despot and his slave. It\n",
      "seemed as though they had so intermingled their souls, that it would\n",
      "have been impossible to tell them apart had they wished to take them\n",
      "back again.—“This is mine.” “No, it is mine.” “I assure you that you\n",
      "are mistaken. This is my property.” “What you are taking as your own is\n",
      "myself.”—Marius was something that made a part of Cosette, and Cosette\n",
      "was something which made a part of Marius. Marius felt Cosette within\n",
      "him. To have Cosette, to possess Cosette, this, to him, was not to be\n",
      "distinguished from breathing. It was in the midst of this faith, of\n",
      "this intoxication, of this virgin possession, unprecedented and\n",
      "absolute, of this sovereignty, that these words: “We are going away,”\n",
      "fell suddenly, at a blow, and that the harsh voice of reality cried to\n",
      "him: “Cosette is not yours!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius awoke. For six weeks Marius had been living, as we have said,\n",

      "harshly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found not a word to say. Cosette merely felt that his hand was very\n",
      "cold. She said to him in her turn: “What is the matter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He replied in so low a tone that Cosette hardly heard him:—\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius was now a thoroughly roused man. He had fallen back into\n",

      "\n",
      "“Go away with you! Are you mad? Why, I should have to have money, and I\n",
      "have none! Go to England? But I am in debt now, I owe, I don’t know how\n",
      "much, more than ten louis to Courfeyrac, one of my friends with whom\n",
      "you are not acquainted! I have an old hat which is not worth three\n",
      "francs, I have a coat which lacks buttons in front, my shirt is all\n",
      "ragged, my elbows are torn, my boots let in the water; for the last six\n",
      "weeks I have not thought about it, and I have not told you about it.\n",
      "You only see me at night, and you give me your love; if you were to see\n",
      "me in the daytime, you would give me a sou! Go to England! Eh! I\n",
      "haven’t enough to pay for a passport!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He threw himself against a tree which was close at hand, erect, his\n",
      "brow pressed close to the bark, feeling neither the wood which flayed\n",
      "his skin, nor the fever which was throbbing in his temples, and there\n",
      "he stood motionless, on the point of falling, like the statue of\n",
      "despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "He remained a long time thus. One could remain for eternity in such\n",

      "It was Cosette sobbing.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "He came to her, fell at her knees, and slowly prostrating himself, he\n",
      "took the tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe, and\n",
      "kissed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She let him have his way in silence. There are moments when a woman\n",
      "accepts, like a sombre and resigned goddess, the religion of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do not weep,” he said.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Not when I may be going away, and you cannot come!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He went on:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you love me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She replied, sobbing, by that word from paradise which is never more\n",
      "charming than amid tears:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I adore you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "“Do not weep. Tell me, will you do this for me, and cease to weep?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you love me?” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cosette, I have never given my word of honor to any one, because my\n",
      "word of honor terrifies me. I feel that my father is by my side. Well,\n",
      "I give you my most sacred word of honor, that if you go away I shall\n",
      "die.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy so\n",
      "solemn and so tranquil, that Cosette trembled. She felt that chill\n",
      "which is produced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by. The shock\n",
      "made her cease weeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, listen,” said he, “do not expect me to-morrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "\n",

      "“He is a man who never changes his habits, and he has never received\n",
      "any one except in the evening.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of what man are you speaking?” asked Cosette.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“What do you hope, then?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes, Cosette.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She took his head in both her hands, raising herself on tiptoe in order\n",
      "to be on a level with him, and tried to read his hope in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius resumed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now that I think of it, you ought to know my address: something might\n",
      "happen, one never knows; I live with that friend named Courfeyrac, Rue\n",
      "de la Verrerie, No. 16.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He searched in his pocket, pulled out his penknife, and with the blade\n",
      "he wrote on the plaster of the wall:—\n",
      "\n",
      "_“16 Rue de la Verrerie.”_\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, Cosette had begun to gaze into his eyes once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell me your thought, Marius; you have some idea. Tell it to me. Oh!\n",
      "tell me, so that I may pass a pleasant night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is my idea: that it is impossible that God should mean to part\n",
      "us. Wait; expect me the day after to-morrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What shall I do until then?” said Cosette. “You are outside, you go,\n",
      "and come! How happy men are! I shall remain entirely alone! Oh! How sad\n",
      "I shall be! What is it that you are going to do to-morrow evening? tell\n",
      "me.”\n",

      "“Then I will pray to God and I will think of you here, so that you may\n",
      "be successful. I will question you no further, since you do not wish\n",
      "it. You are my master. I shall pass the evening to-morrow in singing\n",
      "that music from _Euryanthe_ that you love, and that you came one\n",
      "evening to listen to, outside my shutters. But day after to-morrow you\n",

      "At that epoch, Father Gillenormand was well past his ninety-first\n",
      "birthday. He still lived with Mademoiselle Gillenormand in the Rue des\n",
      "Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the old house which he owned. He was, as\n",
      "the reader will remember, one of those antique old men who await death\n",
      "perfectly erect, whom age bears down without bending, and whom even\n",
      "sorrow cannot curve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, his daughter had been saying for some time: “My father is\n",
      "sinking.” He no longer boxed the maids’ ears; he no longer thumped the\n",
      "landing-place so vigorously with his cane when Basque was slow in\n",
      "opening the door. The Revolution of July had exasperated him for the\n",
      "space of barely six months. He had viewed, almost tranquilly, that\n",
      "coupling of words, in the _Moniteur:_ M. Humblot-Conté, peer of France.\n",
      "The fact is, that the old man was deeply dejected. He did not bend, he\n",
      "did not yield; this was no more a characteristic of his physical than\n",
      "of his moral nature, but he felt himself giving way internally. For\n",
      "four years he had been waiting for Marius, with his foot firmly\n",
      "planted, that is the exact word, in the conviction that that\n",
      "good-for-nothing young scamp would ring at his door some day or other;\n",
      "now he had reached the point, where, at certain gloomy hours, he said\n",

      "never see Marius again. The idea of never seeing Marius again had never\n",
      "entered his brain until that day; now the thought began to recur to\n",
      "him, and it chilled him. Absence, as is always the case in genuine and\n",
      "natural sentiments, had only served to augment the grandfather’s love\n",
      "for the ungrateful child, who had gone off like a flash. It is during\n",

      "\n",
      "Once as he sat with his knees pressed together, and his eyes almost\n",
      "closed, in a despondent attitude, his daughter ventured to say to him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father, are you as angry with him as ever?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused, not daring to proceed further.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With whom?” he demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With that poor Marius.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He raised his aged head, laid his withered and emaciated fist on the\n",
      "table, and exclaimed in his most irritated and vibrating tone:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor Marius, do you say! That gentleman is a knave, a wretched\n",
      "scoundrel, a vain little ingrate, a heartless, soulless, haughty, and\n",
      "wicked man!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he turned away so that his daughter might not see the tear that\n",
      "stood in his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three days later he broke a silence which had lasted four hours, to say\n",
      "to his daughter point-blank:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had the honor to ask Mademoiselle Gillenormand never to mention him\n",
      "to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Aunt Gillenormand renounced every effort, and pronounced this acute\n",
      "diagnosis: “My father never cared very much for my sister after her\n",
      "folly. It is clear that he detests Marius.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“After her folly” meant: “after she had married the colonel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, as the reader has been able to conjecture, Mademoiselle\n",
      "Gillenormand had failed in her attempt to substitute her favorite, the\n",
      "officer of lancers, for Marius. The substitute, Théodule, had not been\n",
      "a success. M. Gillenormand had not accepted the _quid pro quo_. A\n",
      "vacancy in the heart does not accommodate itself to a stop-gap.\n",
      "Théodule, on his side, though he scented the inheritance, was disgusted\n",
      "at the task of pleasing. The goodman bored the lancer; and the lancer\n",
      "shocked the goodman. Lieutenant Théodule was gay, no doubt, but a\n",
      "chatter-box, frivolous, but vulgar; a high liver, but a frequenter of\n",
      "bad company; he had mistresses, it is true, and he had a great deal to\n",
      "say about them, it is true also; but he talked badly. All his good\n",
      "qualities had a defect. M. Gillenormand was worn out with hearing him\n",
      "tell about the love affairs that he had in the vicinity of the barracks\n",
      "in the Rue de Babylone. And then, Lieutenant Gillenormand sometimes\n",
      "came in his uniform, with the tricolored cockade. This rendered him\n",
      "downright intolerable. Finally, Father Gillenormand had said to his\n",
      "daughter: “I’ve had enough of that Théodule. I haven’t much taste for\n",
      "warriors in time of peace. Receive him if you choose. I don’t know but\n",
      "I prefer slashers to fellows that drag their swords. The clash of\n",
      "blades in battle is less dismal, after all, than the clank of the\n",
      "scabbard on the pavement. And then, throwing out your chest like a\n",
      "bully and lacing yourself like a girl, with stays under your cuirass,\n",
      "is doubly ridiculous. When one is a veritable man, one holds equally\n",
      "aloof from swagger and from affected airs. He is neither a blusterer\n",
      "nor a finnicky-hearted man. Keep your Théodule for yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in vain that his daughter said to him: “But he is your\n",
      "grandnephew, nevertheless,”—it turned out that M. Gillenormand, who was\n",
      "a grandfather to the very finger-tips, was not in the least a\n",
      "grand-uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, as he had good sense, and as he had compared the two, Théodule\n",
      "had only served to make him regret Marius all the more.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening,—it was the 24th of June, which did not prevent Father\n",
      "Gillenormand having a rousing fire on the hearth,—he had dismissed his\n",
      "daughter, who was sewing in a neighboring apartment. He was alone in\n",
      "his chamber, amid its pastoral scenes, with his feet propped on the\n",
      "andirons, half enveloped in his huge screen of coromandel lacquer, with\n",
      "its nine leaves, with his elbow resting on a table where burned two\n",
      "candles under a green shade, engulfed in his tapestry armchair, and in\n",
      "his hand a book which he was not reading. He was dressed, according to\n",
      "his wont, like an _incroyable_, and resembled an antique portrait by\n",
      "Garat. This would have made people run after him in the street, had not\n",
      "his daughter covered him up, whenever he went out, in a vast bishop’s\n",
      "wadded cloak, which concealed his attire. At home, he never wore a\n",
      "dressing gown, except when he rose and retired. “It gives one a look of\n",
      "age,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "Father Gillenormand was thinking of Marius lovingly and bitterly; and,\n",
      "as usual, bitterness predominated. His tenderness once soured always\n",
      "ended by boiling and turning to indignation. He had reached the point\n",
      "where a man tries to make up his mind and to accept that which rends\n",
      "his heart. He was explaining to himself that there was no longer any\n",
      "reason why Marius should return, that if he intended to return, he\n",
      "should have done it long ago, that he must renounce the idea. He was\n",
      "trying to accustom himself to the thought that all was over, and that\n",
      "he should die without having beheld “that gentleman” again. But his\n",
      "whole nature revolted; his aged paternity would not consent to this.\n",
      "“Well!” said he,—this was his doleful refrain,—“he will not return!”\n",
      "His bald head had fallen upon his breast, and he fixed a melancholy and\n",
      "irritated gaze upon the ashes on his hearth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the very midst of his reverie, his old servant Basque entered, and\n",
      "inquired:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can Monsieur receive M. Marius?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man sat up erect, pallid, and like a corpse which rises under\n",
      "the influence of a galvanic shock. All his blood had retreated to his\n",
      "heart. He stammered:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“M. Marius what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know,” replied Basque, intimidated and put out of countenance\n",
      "by his master’s air; “I have not seen him. Nicolette came in and said\n",
      "to me: ‘There’s a young man here; say that it is M. Marius.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Father Gillenormand stammered in a low voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Show him in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he remained in the same attitude, with shaking head, and his eyes\n",
      "fixed on the door. It opened once more. A young man entered. It was\n",
      "Marius.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius halted at the door, as though waiting to be bidden to enter.\n",
      "\n",
      "His almost squalid attire was not perceptible in the obscurity caused\n",
      "by the shade. Nothing could be seen but his calm, grave, but strangely\n",
      "sad face.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was several minutes before Father Gillenormand, dulled with\n",
      "amazement and joy, could see anything except a brightness as when one\n",
      "is in the presence of an apparition. He was on the point of swooning;\n",
      "he saw Marius through a dazzling light. It certainly was he, it\n",
      "certainly was Marius.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last! After the lapse of four years! He grasped him entire, so to\n",
      "speak, in a single glance. He found him noble, handsome, distinguished,\n",
      "well-grown, a complete man, with a suitable mien and a charming air. He\n",
      "felt a desire to open his arms, to call him, to fling himself forward;\n",
      "his heart melted with rapture, affectionate words swelled and\n",
      "overflowed his breast; at length all his tenderness came to the light\n",
      "and reached his lips, and, by a contrast which constituted the very\n",
      "foundation of his nature, what came forth was harshness. He said\n",
      "abruptly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What have you come here for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius replied with embarrassment:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Gillenormand would have liked to have Marius throw himself into his\n",
      "arms. He was displeased with Marius and with himself. He was conscious\n",
      "that he was brusque, and that Marius was cold. It caused the goodman\n",
      "unendurable and irritating anxiety to feel so tender and forlorn\n",
      "within, and only to be able to be hard outside. Bitterness returned. He\n",
      "interrupted Marius in a peevish tone:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then why did you come?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That “then” signified: _If you do not come to embrace me_. Marius\n",
      "looked at his grandfather, whose pallor gave him a face of marble.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur—”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you come to beg my pardon? Do you acknowledge your faults?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought he was putting Marius on the right road, and that “the\n",
      "child” would yield. Marius shivered; it was the denial of his father\n",
      "that was required of him; he dropped his eyes and replied:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then,” exclaimed the old man impetuously, with a grief that was\n",
      "poignant and full of wrath, “what do you want of me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius clasped his hands, advanced a step, and said in a feeble and\n",
      "trembling voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir, have pity on me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These words touched M. Gillenormand; uttered a little sooner, they\n",
      "would have rendered him tender, but they came too late. The grandfather\n",
      "rose; he supported himself with both hands on his cane; his lips were\n",
      "white, his brow wavered, but his lofty form towered above Marius as he\n",
      "bowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pity on you, sir! It is youth demanding pity of the old man of\n",
      "ninety-one! You are entering into life, I am leaving it; you go to the\n",
      "play, to balls, to the café, to the billiard-hall; you have wit, you\n",
      "please the women, you are a handsome fellow; as for me, I spit on my\n",
      "brands in the heart of summer; you are rich with the only riches that\n",
      "are really such, I possess all the poverty of age; infirmity,\n",
      "isolation! You have your thirty-two teeth, a good digestion, bright\n",
      "eyes, strength, appetite, health, gayety, a forest of black hair; I\n",
      "have no longer even white hair, I have lost my teeth, I am losing my\n",
      "legs, I am losing my memory; there are three names of streets that I\n",
      "confound incessantly, the Rue Charlot, the Rue du Chaume, and the Rue\n",
      "Saint-Claude, that is what I have come to; you have before you the\n",
      "whole future, full of sunshine, and I am beginning to lose my sight, so\n",
      "far am I advancing into the night; you are in love, that is a matter of\n",
      "course, I am beloved by no one in all the world; and you ask pity of\n",
      "me! Parbleu! Molière forgot that. If that is the way you jest at the\n",
      "courthouse, Messieurs the lawyers, I sincerely compliment you. You are\n",
      "droll.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And the octogenarian went on in a grave and angry voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, now, what do you want of me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir,” said Marius, “I know that my presence is displeasing to you, but\n",
      "I have come merely to ask one thing of you, and then I shall go away\n",
      "immediately.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a fool!” said the old man. “Who said that you were to go\n",
      "away?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the translation of the tender words which lay at the bottom of\n",
      "his heart:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ask my pardon! Throw yourself on my neck!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Gillenormand felt that Marius would leave him in a few moments, that\n",
      "his harsh reception had repelled the lad, that his hardness was driving\n",
      "him away; he said all this to himself, and it augmented his grief; and\n",
      "as his grief was straightway converted into wrath, it increased his\n",
      "harshness. He would have liked to have Marius understand, and Marius\n",
      "did not understand, which made the goodman furious.\n",
      "\n",
      "He began again:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! you deserted me, your grandfather, you left my house to go no\n",
      "one knows whither, you drove your aunt to despair, you went off, it is\n",
      "easily guessed, to lead a bachelor life; it’s more convenient, to play\n",
      "the dandy, to come in at all hours, to amuse yourself; you have given\n",
      "me no signs of life, you have contracted debts without even telling me\n",
      "to pay them, you have become a smasher of windows and a blusterer, and,\n",
      "at the end of four years, you come to me, and that is all you have to\n",
      "say to me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This violent fashion of driving a grandson to tenderness was productive\n",
      "only of silence on the part of Marius. M. Gillenormand folded his arms;\n",
      "a gesture which with him was peculiarly imperious, and apostrophized\n",
      "Marius bitterly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us make an end of this. You have come to ask something of me, you\n",
      "say? Well, what? What is it? Speak!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir,” said Marius, with the look of a man who feels that he is falling\n",
      "over a precipice, “I have come to ask your permission to marry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Gillenormand rang the bell. Basque opened the door half-way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Call my daughter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A second later, the door was opened once more, Mademoiselle\n",
      "Gillenormand did not enter, but showed herself; Marius was standing,\n",
      "mute, with pendant arms and the face of a criminal; M. Gillenormand was\n",
      "pacing back and forth in the room. He turned to his daughter and said\n",
      "to her:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing. It is Monsieur Marius. Say good day to him. Monsieur wishes\n",
      "to marry. That’s all. Go away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The curt, hoarse sound of the old man’s voice announced a strange\n",
      "degree of excitement. The aunt gazed at Marius with a frightened air,\n",
      "hardly appeared to recognize him, did not allow a gesture or a syllable\n",
      "to escape her, and disappeared at her father’s breath more swiftly than\n",
      "a straw before the hurricane.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, Father Gillenormand had returned and placed his back\n",
      "against the chimney-piece once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You marry! At one and twenty! You have arranged that! You have only a\n",
      "permission to ask! a formality. Sit down, sir. Well, you have had a\n",
      "revolution since I had the honor to see you last. The Jacobins got the\n",
      "upper hand. You must have been delighted. Are you not a Republican\n",
      "since you are a Baron? You can make that agree. The Republic makes a\n",
      "good sauce for the barony. Are you one of those decorated by July? Have\n",
      "you taken the Louvre at all, sir? Quite near here, in the Rue\n",
      "Saint-Antoine, opposite the Rue des Nonamdières, there is a cannon-ball\n",
      "incrusted in the wall of the third story of a house with this\n",
      "inscription: ‘July 28th, 1830.’ Go take a look at that. It produces a\n",
      "good effect. Ah! those friends of yours do pretty things. By the way,\n",
      "aren’t they erecting a fountain in the place of the monument of M. le\n",
      "Duc de Berry? So you want to marry? Whom? Can one inquire without\n",
      "indiscretion?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, and, before Marius had time to answer, he added violently:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come now, you have a profession? A fortune made? How much do you earn\n",
      "at your trade of lawyer?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing,” said Marius, with a sort of firmness and resolution that was\n",
      "almost fierce.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing? Then all that you have to live upon is the twelve hundred\n",
      "livres that I allow you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius did not reply. M. Gillenormand continued:—\n",

      "\n",
      "“As rich as I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! No dowry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Expectations?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think not.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Utterly naked! What’s the father?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir,” repeated Marius, in the despair at the last hope, which was\n",
      "vanishing, “I entreat you! I conjure you in the name of Heaven, with\n",
      "clasped hands, sir, I throw myself at your feet, permit me to marry\n",
      "her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Ah! ah! ah! You said to yourself: ‘Pardine! I’ll go hunt up that old\n",

      "How I’d treat him to a nice respectful summons! How nicely I’d get\n",
      "along without him! It’s nothing to me, I’d say to him: “You’re only too\n",

      "\n",
      "This had been sufficient to make him come to a decision.\n",

      "_16 Rue de la Verrerie_.\n",

      "However, and those who have observed the depths of the human heart will\n",

      "might, apparently, expect some complications from this revelation made\n",
      "point-blank by the grandfather to the grandson. But what the drama\n",
      "would gain thereby, truth would lose. Marius was at an age when one\n",

      "He began to wander about the streets, the resource of those who suffer.\n",
      "He thought of nothing, so far as he could afterwards remember. At two\n",
      "o’clock in the morning he returned to Courfeyrac’s quarters and flung\n",
      "himself, without undressing, on his mattress. The sun was shining\n",
      "brightly when he sank into that frightful leaden slumber which permits\n",
      "ideas to go and come in the brain. When he awoke, he saw Courfeyrac,\n",
      "Enjolras, Feuilly, and Combeferre standing in the room with their hats\n",
      "on and all ready to go out.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Are you coming to General Lamarque’s funeral?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to him that Courfeyrac was speaking Chinese.\n",

      "which Javert had given him at the time of the adventure on the 3d of\n",
      "February, and which had remained in his hands. These pistols were still\n",
      "loaded. It would be difficult to say what vague thought he had in his\n",
      "mind when he took them with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "All day long he prowled about, without knowing where he was going; it\n",
      "rained at times, he did not perceive it; for his dinner, he purchased a\n",
      "penny roll at a baker’s, put it in his pocket and forgot it. It appears\n",
      "that he took a bath in the Seine without being aware of it. There are\n",
      "moments when a man has a furnace within his skull. Marius was passing\n",
      "through one of those moments. He no longer hoped for anything; this\n",
      "step he had taken since the preceding evening. He waited for night with\n",
      "feverish impatience, he had but one idea clearly before his mind;—this\n",
      "was, that at nine o’clock he should see Cosette. This last happiness\n",
      "now constituted his whole future; after that, gloom. At intervals, as\n",
      "he roamed through the most deserted boulevards, it seemed to him that\n",
      "he heard strange noises in Paris. He thrust his head out of his reverie\n",
      "and said: “Is there fighting on hand?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At nightfall, at nine o’clock precisely, as he had promised Cosette, he\n",
      "was in the Rue Plumet. When he approached the grating he forgot\n",
      "everything. It was forty-eight hours since he had seen Cosette; he was\n",
      "about to behold her once more; every other thought was effaced, and he\n",
      "felt only a profound and unheard-of joy. Those minutes in which one\n",
      "lives centuries always have this sovereign and wonderful property, that\n",
      "at the moment when they are passing they fill the heart completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius displaced the bar, and rushed headlong into the garden. Cosette\n",
      "was not at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him. He traversed\n",
      "the thicket, and approached the recess near the flight of steps: “She\n",
      "is waiting for me there,” said he. Cosette was not there. He raised his\n",
      "eyes, and saw that the shutters of the house were closed. He made the\n",
      "tour of the garden, the garden was deserted. Then he returned to the\n",
      "house, and, rendered senseless by love, intoxicated, terrified,\n",
      "exasperated with grief and uneasiness, like a master who returns home\n",
      "at an evil hour, he tapped on the shutters. He knocked and knocked\n",
      "again, at the risk of seeing the window open, and her father’s gloomy\n",
      "face make its appearance, and demand: “What do you want?” This was\n",
      "nothing in comparison with what he dimly caught a glimpse of. When he\n",
      "had rapped, he lifted up his voice and called Cosette.—“Cosette!” he\n",
      "cried; “Cosette!” he repeated imperiously. There was no reply. All was\n",
      "over. No one in the garden; no one in the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius fixed his despairing eyes on that dismal house, which was as\n",
      "black and as silent as a tomb and far more empty. He gazed at the stone\n",
      "seat on which he had passed so many adorable hours with Cosette. Then\n",
      "he seated himself on the flight of steps, his heart filled with\n",
      "sweetness and resolution, he blessed his love in the depths of his\n",
      "thought, and he said to himself that, since Cosette was gone, all that\n",
      "there was left for him was to die.\n",

      "serenity. His eyes acquired some vivacity when they rested on his\n",
      "books, and he smiled when he gazed at the Diogenes Laertius, which was\n",

      "after another, as a father obliged to decimate his children would gaze\n",
      "upon them before making a choice, then seized one hastily, put it in\n",
      "under his arm and went out. He returned two hours later, without\n",
      "anything under his arm, laid thirty sous on the table, and said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will get something for dinner.”\n",

      "On the following day, on the day after, and on the day after that, it\n",
      "had to be done again.\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Mabeuf went out with a book and returned with a coin. As the\n",
      "second-hand dealers perceived that he was forced to sell, they\n",
      "purchased of him for twenty sous that for which he had paid twenty\n",
      "francs, sometimes at those very shops. Volume by volume, the whole\n",
      "library went the same road. He said at times: “But I am eighty;” as\n",
      "though he cherished some secret hope that he should arrive at the end\n",
      "of his days before reaching the end of his books. His melancholy\n",
      "increased. Once, however, he had a pleasure. He had gone out with a\n",
      "Robert Estienne, which he had sold for thirty-five sous under the Quai\n",
      "Malaquais, and he returned with an Aldus which he had bought for forty\n",
      "sous in the Rue des Grès.—“I owe five sous,” he said, beaming on Mother\n",
      "Plutarque. That day he had no dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "He belonged to the Horticultural Society. His destitution became known\n",
      "there. The president of the society came to see him, promised to speak\n",
      "to the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce about him, and did\n",
      "so.—“Why, what!” exclaimed the Minister, “I should think so! An old\n",
      "savant! a botanist! an inoffensive man! Something must be done for\n",
      "him!” On the following day, M. Mabeuf received an invitation to dine\n",
      "with the Minister. Trembling with joy, he showed the letter to Mother\n",
      "Plutarque. “We are saved!” said he. On the day appointed, he went to\n",
      "the Minister’s house. He perceived that his ragged cravat, his long,\n",
      "square coat, and his waxed shoes astonished the ushers. No one spoke to\n",
      "him, not even the Minister. About ten o’clock in the evening, while he\n",
      "was still waiting for a word, he heard the Minister’s wife, a beautiful\n",
      "woman in a low-necked gown whom he had not ventured to approach,\n",
      "inquire: “Who is that old gentleman?” He returned home on foot at\n",
      "midnight, in a driving rain-storm. He had sold an Elzevir to pay for a\n",

      "\n",
      "He had acquired the habit of reading a few pages in his Diogenes\n",
      "Laertius every night, before he went to bed. He knew enough Greek to\n",
      "enjoy the peculiarities of the text which he owned. He had now no other\n",
      "enjoyment. Several weeks passed. All at once, Mother Plutarque fell\n",
      "ill. There is one thing sadder than having no money with which to buy\n",
      "bread at the baker’s and that is having no money to purchase drugs at\n",
      "the apothecary’s. One evening, the doctor had ordered a very expensive\n",
      "potion. And the malady was growing worse; a nurse was required. M.\n",
      "Mabeuf opened his bookcase; there was nothing there. The last volume\n",
      "had taken its departure. All that was left to him was Diogenes\n",
      "Laertius. He put this unique copy under his arm, and went out. It was\n",
      "the 4th of June, 1832; he went to the Porte Saint-Jacques, to Royal’s\n",
      "successor, and returned with one hundred francs. He laid the pile of\n",
      "five-franc pieces on the old serving-woman’s nightstand, and returned\n",
      "to his chamber without saying a word.\n",

      "hopes for a downfall, some outcome, in short, at the very bottom, the\n",
      "rabble, that mud which catches fire,—such are the elements of revolt.\n",
      "That which is grandest and that which is basest; the beings who prowl\n",
      "outside of all bounds, awaiting an occasion, bohemians, vagrants,\n",
      "vagabonds of the crossroads, those who sleep at night in a desert of\n",
      "houses with no other roof than the cold clouds of heaven, those who,\n",
      "each day, demand their bread from chance and not from toil, the unknown\n",

      "revolt. Whoever cherishes in his soul a secret revolt against any deed\n",
      "whatever on the part of the state, of life or of fate, is ripe for\n",
      "riot, and, as soon as it makes its appearance, he begins to quiver, and\n",
      "to feel himself borne away with the whirlwind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Revolt is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which forms\n",

      "revolt strengthens those governments which it does not overthrow. It\n",
      "puts the army to the test; it consecrates the bourgeoisie, it draws out\n",
      "the muscles of the police; it demonstrates the force of the social\n",
      "framework. It is an exercise in gymnastics; it is almost hygiene. Power\n",

      "If we listen to this school, “The riots which complicated the affair of\n",

      "blue sky. They made the cloudy sky reappear. They caused that\n",

      "into a quarrel. In the Revolution of July, as in all progress\n",
      "accomplished by fits and starts, there had been secret fractures; these\n",
      "riots rendered them perceptible. It might have been said: ‘Ah! this is\n",

      "\n",
      "“No doubt, historically, uprisings have their beauty; the war of the\n",

      "Guard invincible, bivouacs of shopkeepers, fortresses of street\n",
      "urchins, contempt of death on the part of passers-by. Schools and\n",
      "legions clashed together. After all, between the combatants, there was\n",
      "only a difference of age; the race is the same; it is the same stoical\n",
      "men who died at the age of twenty for their ideas, at forty for their\n",
      "families. The army, always a sad thing in civil wars, opposed prudence\n",

      "\n",
      "There is such a thing as an uprising, and there is such a thing as\n",
      "insurrection; these are two separate phases of wrath; one is in the\n",
      "wrong, the other is in the right. In democratic states, the only ones\n",
      "which are founded on justice, it sometimes happens that the fraction\n",
      "usurps; then the whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights may\n",
      "proceed as far as resort to arms. In all questions which result from\n",
      "collective sovereignty, the war of the whole against the fraction is\n",
      "insurrection; the attack of the fraction against the whole is revolt;\n",
      "according as the Tuileries contain a king or the Convention, they are\n",
      "justly or unjustly attacked. The same cannon, pointed against the\n",
      "populace, is wrong on the 10th of August, and right on the 14th of\n",
      "Vendémiaire. Alike in appearance, fundamentally different in reality;\n",
      "the Swiss defend the false, Bonaparte defends the true. That which\n",
      "universal suffrage has effected in its liberty and in its sovereignty\n",
      "cannot be undone by the street. It is the same in things pertaining\n",
      "purely to civilization; the instinct of the masses, clear-sighted\n",
      "to-day, may be troubled to-morrow. The same fury legitimate when\n",
      "directed against Terray and absurd when directed against Turgot. The\n",
      "destruction of machines, the pillage of warehouses, the breaking of\n",
      "rails, the demolition of docks, the false routes of multitudes, the\n",
      "refusal by the people of justice to progress, Ramus assassinated by\n",
      "students, Rousseau driven out of Switzerland and stoned,—that is\n",
      "revolt. Israel against Moses, Athens against Phocian, Rome against\n",
      "Cicero,—that is an uprising; Paris against the Bastille,—that is\n",
      "insurrection. The soldiers against Alexander, the sailors against\n",
      "Christopher Columbus,—this is the same revolt; impious revolt; why?\n",
      "Because Alexander is doing for Asia with the sword that which\n",
      "Christopher Columbus is doing for America with the compass; Alexander\n",
      "like Columbus, is finding a world. These gifts of a world to\n",
      "civilization are such augmentations of light, that all resistance in\n",
      "that case is culpable. Sometimes the populace counterfeits fidelity to\n",
      "itself. The masses are traitors to the people. Is there, for example,\n",
      "anything stranger than that long and bloody protest of dealers in\n",
      "contraband salt, a legitimate chronic revolt, which, at the decisive\n",
      "moment, on the day of salvation, at the very hour of popular victory,\n",
      "espouses the throne, turns into _chouannerie_, and, from having been an\n",
      "insurrection against, becomes an uprising for, sombre masterpieces of\n",
      "ignorance! The contraband salt dealer escapes the royal gibbets, and\n",
      "with a rope’s end round his neck, mounts the white cockade. “Death to\n",

      "recognizable, it does not always proceed from the trembling of excited\n",
      "masses; there are mad rages, there are cracked bells, all tocsins do\n",
      "not give out the sound of bronze. The brawl of passions and ignorances\n",
      "is quite another thing from the shock of progress. Show me in what\n",
      "direction you are going. Rise, if you will, but let it be that you may\n",
      "grow great. There is no insurrection except in a forward direction. Any\n",
      "other sort of rising is bad; every violent step towards the rear is a\n",
      "revolt; to retreat is to commit a deed of violence against the human\n",
      "race. Insurrection is a fit of rage on the part of truth; the pavements\n",
      "which the uprising disturbs give forth the spark of right. These\n",

      "mysteriously avoided, by the One who, when He sets the centuries on the\n",
      "stage, regulates the entrances and the exits. Cæsar is great, Tacitus\n",
      "is great; God spares these two greatnesses by not allowing them to\n",
      "clash with one another. The guardian of justice, in striking Cæsar,\n",

      "introduced into Gaul, into Britanny, into Germany,—all this glory\n",
      "covers the Rubicon. There is here a sort of delicacy of the divine\n",

      "formidable historian, sparing Cæsar Tacitus, and according extenuating\n",
      "circumstances to genius.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, despotism remains despotism, even under the despot of\n",
      "genius. There is corruption under all illustrious tyrants, but the\n",
      "moral pest is still more hideous under infamous tyrants. In such\n",
      "reigns, nothing veils the shame; and those who make examples, Tacitus\n",

      "Rome smells worse under Vitellius than under Sylla. Under Claudius and\n",
      "under Domitian, there is a deformity of baseness corresponding to the\n",

      "of the despot; a miasma exhales from these cowering consciences wherein\n",
      "the master is reflected; public powers are unclean; hearts are small;\n",
      "consciences are dull, souls are like vermin; thus it is under\n",
      "Caracalla, thus it is under Commodus, thus it is under Heliogabalus,\n",

      "appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Juvenal and Tacitus, like Isaiah in Biblical times, like Dante in\n",
      "the Middle Ages, is man; riot and insurrection are the multitude, which\n",
      "is sometimes right and sometimes wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the majority of cases, riot proceeds from a material fact;\n",
      "insurrection is always a moral phenomenon. Riot is Masaniello;\n",

      "stomach; Gaster grows irritated; but Gaster, assuredly, is not always\n",
      "in the wrong. In questions of famine, riot, Buzançais, for example,\n",
      "holds a true, pathetic, and just point of departure. Nevertheless, it\n",
      "remains a riot. Why? It is because, right at bottom, it was wrong in\n",
      "form. Shy although in the right, violent although strong, it struck at\n",
      "random; it walked like a blind elephant; it left behind it the corpses\n",
      "of old men, of women, and of children; it wished the blood of\n",
      "inoffensive and innocent persons without knowing why. The nourishment\n",
      "of the people is a good object; to massacre them is a bad means.\n",
      "\n",
      "All armed protests, even the most legitimate, even that of the 10th of\n",
      "August, even that of July 14th, begin with the same troubles. Before\n",
      "the right gets set free, there is foam and tumult. In the beginning,\n",
      "the insurrection is a riot, just as a river is a torrent. Ordinarily it\n",
      "ends in that ocean: revolution. Sometimes, however, coming from those\n",
      "lofty mountains which dominate the moral horizon, justice, wisdom,\n",
      "reason, right, formed of the pure snow of the ideal, after a long fall\n",
      "from rock to rock, after having reflected the sky in its transparency\n",
      "and increased by a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph,\n",
      "insurrection is suddenly lost in some quagmire, as the Rhine is in a\n",
      "swamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this is of the past, the future is another thing. Universal\n",
      "suffrage has this admirable property, that it dissolves riot in its\n",
      "inception, and, by giving the vote to insurrection, it deprives it of\n",
      "its arms. The disappearance of wars, of street wars as well as of wars\n",
      "on the frontiers, such is the inevitable progression. Whatever To-day\n",
      "may be, To-morrow will be peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, insurrection, riot, and points of difference between the\n",
      "former and the latter,—the bourgeois, properly speaking, knows nothing\n",
      "of such shades. In his mind, all is sedition, rebellion pure and\n",
      "simple, the revolt of the dog against his master, an attempt to bite\n",
      "whom must be punished by the chain and the kennel, barking, snapping,\n",

      "\n",
      "It may happen to us, in placing this formidable event on the stage, to\n",

      "extinction, so much grandeur, that even those who see in it only an\n",
      "uprising, never refer to it otherwise than with respect. For them, it\n",
      "is like a relic of 1830. Excited imaginations, say they, are not to be\n",
      "calmed in a day. A revolution cannot be cut off short. It must needs\n",
      "undergo some undulations before it returns to a state of rest, like a\n",

      "The facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic and\n",

      "CHAPTER III—A BURIAL; AN OCCASION TO BE BORN AGAIN\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the spring of 1832, although the cholera had been chilling all minds\n",
      "for the last three months and had cast over their agitation an\n",
      "indescribable and gloomy pacification, Paris had already long been ripe\n",
      "for commotion. As we have said, the great city resembles a piece of\n",
      "artillery; when it is loaded, it suffices for a spark to fall, and the\n",
      "shot is discharged. In June, 1832, the spark was the death of General\n",
      "Lamarque.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lamarque was a man of renown and of action. He had had in succession,\n",
      "under the Empire and under the Restoration, the sorts of bravery\n",
      "requisite for the two epochs, the bravery of the battle-field and the\n",
      "bravery of the tribune. He was as eloquent as he had been valiant; a\n",
      "sword was discernible in his speech. Like Foy, his predecessor, after\n",
      "upholding the command, he upheld liberty; he sat between the left and\n",
      "the extreme left, beloved of the people because he accepted the chances\n",
      "of the future, beloved of the populace because he had served the\n",
      "Emperor well; he was, in company with Comtes Gérard and Drouet, one of\n",
      "Napoleon’s marshals _in petto_. The treaties of 1815 removed him as a\n",
      "personal offence. He hated Wellington with a downright hatred which\n",
      "pleased the multitude; and, for seventeen years, he majestically\n",
      "preserved the sadness of Waterloo, paying hardly any attention to\n",
      "intervening events. In his death agony, at his last hour, he clasped to\n",
      "his breast a sword which had been presented to him by the officers of\n",
      "the Hundred Days. Napoleon had died uttering the word _army_, Lamarque\n",
      "uttering the word _country_.\n",
      "\n",
      "His death, which was expected, was dreaded by the people as a loss, and\n",
      "by the government as an occasion. This death was an affliction. Like\n",
      "everything that is bitter, affliction may turn to revolt. This is what\n",
      "took place.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the preceding evening, and on the morning of the 5th of June, the\n",
      "day appointed for Lamarque’s burial, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which\n",
      "the procession was to touch at, assumed a formidable aspect. This\n",
      "tumultuous network of streets was filled with rumors. They armed\n",
      "themselves as best they might. Joiners carried off door-weights of\n",
      "their establishment “to break down doors.” One of them had made himself\n",
      "a dagger of a stocking-weaver’s hook by breaking off the hook and\n",
      "sharpening the stump. Another, who was in a fever “to attack,” slept\n",
      "wholly dressed for three days. A carpenter named Lombier met a comrade,\n",
      "who asked him: “Whither are you going?” “Eh! well, I have no weapons.”\n",
      "“What then?” “I’m going to my timber-yard to get my compasses.” “What\n",
      "for?” “I don’t know,” said Lombier. A certain Jacqueline, an\n",
      "expeditious man, accosted some passing artisans: “Come here, you!” He\n",
      "treated them to ten sous’ worth of wine and said: “Have you work?”\n",
      "“No.” “Go to Filspierre, between the Barrière Charonne and the Barrière\n",
      "Montreuil, and you will find work.” At Filspierre’s they found\n",
      "cartridges and arms. Certain well-known leaders were going the rounds,\n",
      "that is to say, running from one house to another, to collect their\n",
      "men. At Barthélemy’s, near the Barrière du Trône, at Capel’s, near the\n",
      "Petit-Chapeau, the drinkers accosted each other with a grave air. They\n",
      "were heard to say: “Have you your pistol?” “Under my blouse.” “And\n",
      "you?” “Under my shirt.” In the Rue Traversière, in front of the Bland\n",
      "workshop, and in the yard of the Maison-Brulée, in front of tool-maker\n",
      "Bernier’s, groups whispered together. Among them was observed a certain\n",
      "Mavot, who never remained more than a week in one shop, as the masters\n",
      "always discharged him “because they were obliged to dispute with him\n",
      "every day.” Mavot was killed on the following day at the barricade of\n",
      "the Rue Ménilmontant. Pretot, who was destined to perish also in the\n",
      "struggle, seconded Mavot, and to the question: “What is your object?”\n",
      "he replied: _“Insurrection.”_ Workmen assembled at the corner of the\n",
      "Rue de Bercy, waited for a certain Lemarin, the revolutionary agent for\n",
      "the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Watchwords were exchanged almost publicly.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the 5th of June, accordingly, a day of mingled rain and sun, General\n",
      "Lamarque’s funeral procession traversed Paris with official military\n",
      "pomp, somewhat augmented through precaution. Two battalions, with\n",
      "draped drums and reversed arms, ten thousand National Guards, with\n",
      "their swords at their sides, escorted the coffin. The hearse was drawn\n",
      "by young men. The officers of the Invalides came immediately behind it,\n",
      "bearing laurel branches. Then came an innumerable, strange, agitated\n",
      "multitude, the sectionaries of the Friends of the People, the Law\n",
      "School, the Medical School, refugees of all nationalities, and Spanish,\n",
      "Italian, German, and Polish flags, tricolored horizontal banners, every\n",
      "possible sort of banner, children waving green boughs, stone-cutters\n",
      "and carpenters who were on strike at the moment, printers who were\n",
      "recognizable by their paper caps, marching two by two, three by three,\n",
      "uttering cries, nearly all of them brandishing sticks, some brandishing\n",
      "sabres, without order and yet with a single soul, now a tumultuous\n",
      "rout, again a column. Squads chose themselves leaders; a man armed with\n",
      "a pair of pistols in full view, seemed to pass the host in review, and\n",
      "the files separated before him. On the side alleys of the boulevards,\n",
      "in the branches of the trees, on balconies, in windows, on the roofs,\n",
      "swarmed the heads of men, women, and children; all eyes were filled\n",
      "with anxiety. An armed throng was passing, and a terrified throng\n",
      "looked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Government, on its side, was taking observations. It observed with\n",
      "its hand on its sword. Four squadrons of carabineers could be seen in\n",
      "the Place Louis XV. in their saddles, with their trumpets at their\n",
      "head, cartridge-boxes filled and muskets loaded, all in readiness to\n",
      "march; in the Latin country and at the Jardin des Plantes, the\n",
      "Municipal Guard echelonned from street to street; at the\n",
      "Halle-aux-Vins, a squadron of dragoons; at the Grève half of the 12th\n",
      "Light Infantry, the other half being at the Bastille; the 6th Dragoons\n",
      "at the Célestins; and the courtyard of the Louvre full of artillery.\n",
      "The remainder of the troops were confined to their barracks, without\n",
      "reckoning the regiments of the environs of Paris. Power being uneasy,\n",
      "held suspended over the menacing multitude twenty-four thousand\n",
      "soldiers in the city and thirty thousand in the banlieue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Divers reports were in circulation in the cortège. Legitimist tricks\n",
      "were hinted at; they spoke of the Duc de Reichstadt, whom God had\n",
      "marked out for death at that very moment when the populace were\n",
      "designating him for the Empire. One personage, whose name has remained\n",
      "unknown, announced that at a given hour two overseers who had been won\n",
      "over, would throw open the doors of a factory of arms to the people.\n",
      "That which predominated on the uncovered brows of the majority of those\n",
      "present was enthusiasm mingled with dejection. Here and there, also, in\n",
      "that multitude given over to such violent but noble emotions, there\n",
      "were visible genuine visages of criminals and ignoble mouths which\n",
      "said: “Let us plunder!” There are certain agitations which stir up the\n",
      "bottoms of marshes and make clouds of mud rise through the water. A\n",
      "phenomenon to which “well drilled” policemen are no strangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The procession proceeded, with feverish slowness, from the house of the\n",
      "deceased, by way of the boulevards as far as the Bastille. It rained\n",
      "from time to time; the rain mattered nothing to that throng. Many\n",
      "incidents, the coffin borne round the Vendome column, stones thrown at\n",
      "the Duc de Fitz-James, who was seen on a balcony with his hat on his\n",
      "head, the Gallic cock torn from a popular flag and dragged in the mire,\n",
      "a policeman wounded with a blow from a sword at the Porte Saint-Martin,\n",
      "an officer of the 12th Light Infantry saying aloud: “I am a\n",
      "Republican,” the Polytechnic School coming up unexpectedly against\n",
      "orders to remain at home, the shouts of: “Long live the Polytechnique!\n",
      "Long live the Republic!” marked the passage of the funeral train. At\n",
      "the Bastille, long files of curious and formidable people who descended\n",
      "from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, effected a junction with the\n",
      "procession, and a certain terrible seething began to agitate the\n",
      "throng.\n",
      "\n",
      "One man was heard to say to another: “Do you see that fellow with a red\n",
      "beard, he’s the one who will give the word when we are to fire.” It\n",
      "appears that this red beard was present, at another riot, the Quénisset\n",
      "affair, entrusted with this same function.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hearse passed the Bastille, traversed the small bridge, and reached\n",
      "the esplanade of the bridge of Austerlitz. There it halted. The crowd,\n",
      "surveyed at that moment with a bird’s-eye view, would have presented\n",
      "the aspect of a comet whose head was on the esplanade and whose tail\n",
      "spread out over the Quai Bourdon, covered the Bastille, and was\n",
      "prolonged on the boulevard as far as the Porte Saint-Martin. A circle\n",
      "was traced around the hearse. The vast rout held their peace. Lafayette\n",
      "spoke and bade Lamarque farewell. This was a touching and august\n",
      "instant, all heads uncovered, all hearts beat high.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once, a man on horseback, clad in black, made his appearance in\n",
      "the middle of the group with a red flag, others say, with a pike\n",
      "surmounted with a red liberty-cap. Lafayette turned aside his head.\n",
      "Exelmans quitted the procession.\n",
      "\n",
      "This red flag raised a storm, and disappeared in the midst of it. From\n",
      "the Boulevard Bourdon to the bridge of Austerlitz one of those clamors\n",
      "which resemble billows stirred the multitude. Two prodigious shouts\n",
      "went up: “Lamarque to the Pantheon!—Lafayette to the Town-hall!” Some\n",
      "young men, amid the declamations of the throng, harnessed themselves\n",
      "and began to drag Lamarque in the hearse across the bridge of\n",
      "Austerlitz and Lafayette in a hackney-coach along the Quai Morland.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the crowd which surrounded and cheered Lafayette, it was noticed\n",
      "that a German showed himself named Ludwig Snyder, who died a\n",
      "centenarian afterwards, who had also been in the war of 1776, and who\n",
      "had fought at Trenton under Washington, and at Brandywine under\n",
      "Lafayette.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been set in\n",
      "motion, and came to bar the bridge, on the right bank the dragoons\n",

      "crowd touched. The women fled in terror. What took place during that\n",
      "fatal minute? No one can say. It is the dark moment when two clouds\n",

      "charge was heard in the direction of the Arsenal, others that a blow\n",
      "from a dagger was given by a child to a dragoon. The fact is, that\n",
      "three shots were suddenly discharged: the first killed Cholet, chief of\n",
      "the squadron, the second killed an old deaf woman who was in the act of\n",
      "closing her window, the third singed the shoulder of an officer; a\n",

      "barricades, the wine-shops and porters’ lodges were converted into\n",

      "scientific military tactics. The narrow, uneven, sinuous streets, full\n",
      "of angles and turns, were admirably chosen; the neighborhood of the\n",
      "Halles, in particular, a network of streets more intricate than a\n",

      "plan of Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "That which had really undertaken the direction of the uprising was a\n",
      "sort of strange impetuosity which was in the air. The insurrection had\n",
      "abruptly built barricades with one hand, and with the other seized\n",
      "nearly all the posts of the garrison. In less than three hours, like a\n",
      "train of powder catching fire, the insurgents had invaded and occupied,\n",
      "on the right bank, the Arsenal, the Mayoralty of the Place Royale, the\n",
      "whole of the Marais, the Popincourt arms manufactory, la Galiote, the\n",
      "Château-d’Eau, and all the streets near the Halles; on the left bank,\n",
      "the barracks of the Veterans, Sainte-Pélagie, the Place Maubert, the\n",
      "powder magazine of the Deux-Moulins, and all the barriers. At five\n",
      "o’clock in the evening, they were masters of the Bastille, of the\n",
      "Lingerie, of the Blancs-Manteaux; their scouts had reached the Place\n",
      "des Victoires, and menaced the Bank, the Petits-Pères barracks, and the\n",
      "Post-Office. A third of Paris was in the hands of the rioters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conflict had been begun on a gigantic scale at all points; and, as\n",
      "a result of the disarming domiciliary visits, and armorers’ shops\n",
      "hastily invaded, was, that the combat which had begun with the throwing\n",
      "of stones was continued with gun-shots.\n",
      "\n",
      "About six o’clock in the evening, the Passage du Saumon became the\n",
      "field of battle. The uprising was at one end, the troops were at the\n",
      "other. They fired from one gate to the other. An observer, a dreamer,\n",
      "the author of this book, who had gone to get a near view of this\n",
      "volcano, found himself in the passage between the two fires. All that\n",
      "he had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two\n",
      "half-columns which separate the shops; he remained in this delicate\n",
      "situation for nearly half an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the call to arms was beaten, the National Guard armed in\n",
      "haste, the legions emerged from the Mayoralities, the regiments from\n",
      "their barracks. Opposite the passage de l’Ancre a drummer received a\n",
      "blow from a dagger. Another, in the Rue du Cygne, was assailed by\n",
      "thirty young men who broke his instrument, and took away his sword.\n",
      "Another was killed in the Rue Grenier-Saint-Lazare. In the Rue\n",
      "Michel-le-Comte, three officers fell dead one after the other. Many of\n",

      "\n",
      "There was the hearth; there, evidently, was the question. All the rest\n",

      "Two intrepid men, tried in great wars, the Marshal Lobau and General\n",

      "scarf of office, went to reconnoitre the streets in rebellion. The\n",
      "insurgents, on their side, placed videttes at the corners of all open\n",
      "spaces, and audaciously sent their patrols outside the barricades. Each\n",
      "side was watching the other. The Government, with an army in its hand,\n",
      "hesitated; the night was almost upon them, and the Saint-Merry tocsin\n",

      "During the last two years, as we have said, Paris had witnessed more\n",
      "than one insurrection. Nothing is, generally, more singularly calm than\n",
      "the physiognomy of Paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of the\n",
      "rebellious quarters. Paris very speedily accustoms herself to\n",
      "anything,—it is only a riot,—and Paris has so many affairs on hand,\n",
      "that she does not put herself out for so small a matter. These colossal\n",
      "cities alone can offer such spectacles. These immense enclosures alone\n",
      "can contain at the same time civil war and an odd and indescribable\n",
      "tranquillity. Ordinarily, when an insurrection commences, when the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Later on, when the heart-rending and mournful hubbub of musketry and\n",

      "A moment later, the riot approaches and gains in force, he shuts up his\n",

      "The theatres open their doors and present vaudevilles; the curious\n",
      "laugh and chat a couple of paces distant from these streets filled with\n",

      "On this occasion, however, in the resort to arms of June 5th, 1832, the\n",

      "nevertheless: “I am with you. I will follow you wherever there is room\n",

      "some policeman and placed in the refuge, or stolen by some mountebank,\n",
      "or having simply strayed off in that immense Chinese puzzle of a Paris,\n",
      "did not return. The lowest depths of the actual social world are full\n",

      "fervor increasing with every moment. Amid the scraps of the\n",

      "\n",
      "“All goes well. I suffer a great deal in my left paw, I’m all broken up\n",

      "\n",
      "At that moment, the horse of a lancer of the National Guard having\n",
      "fallen, Gavroche laid his pistol on the pavement, and picked up the\n",
      "man, then he assisted in raising the horse. After which he picked up\n",
      "his pistol and resumed his way. In the Rue de Thorigny, all was peace\n",
      "and silence. This apathy, peculiar to the Marais, presented a contrast\n",
      "with the vast surrounding uproar. Four gossips were chatting in a\n",

      "Scotland has trios of witches, Paris has quartettes of old gossiping\n",

      "Armuyr. The croak would be almost identical.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gossips of the Rue de Thorigny busied themselves only with their\n",
      "own concerns. Three of them were portresses, and the fourth was a\n",
      "rag-picker with her basket on her back.\n",
      "\n",
      "All four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age,\n",
      "which are decrepitude, decay, ruin, and sadness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rag-picker was humble. In this open-air society, it is the\n",

      "There may be kindness in the broom.\n",
      "\n",
      "This rag-picker was a grateful creature, and she smiled, with what a\n",
      "smile! on the three portresses. Things of this nature were said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, by the way, is your cat still cross?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good gracious, cats are naturally the enemies of dogs, you know. It’s\n",

      "“But the fleas from a cat don’t go after people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s not the trouble, dogs are dangerous. I remember one year when\n",
      "there were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it in the\n",
      "newspapers. That was at the time when there were at the Tuileries great\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“In the morning, on my return home, I pick over my basket, I sort my\n",
      "things. This makes heaps in my room. I put the rags in a basket, the\n",
      "cores and stalks in a bucket, the linen in my cupboard, the woollen\n",
      "stuff in my commode, the old papers in the corner of the window, the\n",
      "things that are good to eat in my bowl, the bits of glass in my\n",
      "fireplace, the old shoes behind my door, and the bones under my bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche had stopped behind her and was listening.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "elevating the tip of his nose with his thumb and opening his hand wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rag-picker cried:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You malicious, bare-pawed little wretch!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The one who answered to the name of Patagon clapped her hands together\n",
      "in horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s going to be evil doings, that’s certain. The errand-boy next\n",
      "door has a little pointed beard, I have seen him pass every day with a\n",
      "young person in a pink bonnet on his arm; to-day I saw him pass, and he\n",
      "had a gun on his arm. Mame Bacheux says, that last week there was a\n",
      "revolution at—at—at—where’s the calf!—at Pontoise. And then, there you\n",
      "see him, that horrid scamp, with his pistol! It seems that the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "promontory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he passed on. When he was in the Rue Pavée, the rag-picker occurred\n",
      "to his mind, and he indulged in this soliloquy:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re in the wrong to insult the revolutionists, Mother\n",
      "Dust-Heap-Corner. This pistol is in your interests. It’s so that you\n",
      "may have more good things to eat in your basket.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once, he heard a shout behind him; it was the portress Patagon\n",
      "who had followed him, and who was shaking her fist at him in the\n",
      "distance and crying:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re nothing but a bastard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Come now,” said Gavroche, “I don’t care a brass farthing for\n",
      "that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly afterwards, he passed the Hotel Lamoignon. There he uttered\n",
      "this appeal:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Forward march to the battle!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he was seized with a fit of melancholy. He gazed at his pistol with\n",
      "an air of reproach which seemed an attempt to appease it:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m going off,” said he, “but you won’t go off!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One dog may distract the attention from another dog.45 A very gaunt\n",

      "soldier of the legion who had served under the Empire. They were\n",
      "talking. The hair-dresser had, naturally, spoken to the veteran of the\n",
      "riot, then of General Lamarque, and from Lamarque they had passed to\n",
      "the Emperor. Thence sprang up a conversation between barber and soldier\n",
      "which Prudhomme, had he been present, would have enriched with\n",

      "deep, a fine head marked with a black star, a very long neck, strongly\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“How fine that is!” exclaimed the hair-dresser, in Pindaric accents,\n",

      "in broad daylight,—this was the style of this cabaret. A staircase with\n",
      "a trap-door in the lower room led to the cellar. On the second floor\n",
      "were the lodgings of the Hucheloup family. They were reached by a\n",
      "staircase which was a ladder rather than a staircase, and had for their\n",

      "that he was a cook; people did not confine themselves to drinking alone\n",
      "in his wine-shop, they also ate there. Hucheloup had invented a capital\n",
      "thing which could be eaten nowhere but in his house, stuffed carps,\n",
      "which he called _carpes au gras_. These were eaten by the light of a\n",
      "tallow candle or of a lamp of the time of Louis XVI., on tables to\n",

      "thither from a distance. Hucheloup, one fine morning, had seen fit to\n",
      "notify passers-by of this “specialty”; he had dipped a brush in a pot\n",
      "of black paint, and as he was an orthographer on his own account, as\n",
      "well as a cook after his own fashion, he had improvised on his wall\n",

      "One winter, the rain-storms and the showers had taken a fancy to\n",

      "CARPE HO RAS.\n",

      "Time and rain assisting, a humble gastronomical announcement had become\n",
      "a profound piece of advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this way it came about, that though he knew no French, Father\n",
      "Hucheloup understood Latin, that he had evoked philosophy from his\n",
      "kitchen, and that, desirous simply of effacing Lent, he had equalled\n",
      "Horace. And the striking thing about it was, that that also meant:\n",

      "Nothing of all this is in existence now. The Mondétour labyrinth was\n",

      "\n",
      "As we have already said, Corinthe was the meeting-place if not the\n",
      "rallying-point, of Courfeyrac and his friends. It was Grantaire who had\n",
      "discovered Corinthe. He had entered it on account of the _Carpe horas_,\n",
      "and had returned thither on account of the _Carpes au gras_. There they\n",

      "paid badly, they did not pay at all, but they were always welcome.\n",
      "Father Hucheloup was a jovial host.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hucheloup, that amiable man, as was just said, was a wine-shop-keeper\n",
      "with a moustache; an amusing variety. He always had an ill-tempered\n",
      "air, seemed to wish to intimidate his customers, grumbled at the people\n",
      "who entered his establishment, and had rather the mien of seeking a\n",
      "quarrel with them than of serving them with soup. And yet, we insist\n",
      "upon the word, people were always welcome there. This oddity had\n",
      "attracted customers to his shop, and brought him young men, who said to\n",
      "each other: “Come hear Father Hucheloup growl.” He had been a\n",
      "fencing-master. All of a sudden, he would burst out laughing. A big\n",
      "voice, a good fellow. He had a comic foundation under a tragic\n",
      "exterior, he asked nothing better than to frighten you, very much like\n",
      "those snuff-boxes which are in the shape of a pistol. The detonation\n",
      "makes one sneeze.\n",

      "About 1830, Father Hucheloup died. With him disappeared the secret of\n",
      "stuffed carps. His inconsolable widow continued to keep the wine-shop.\n",
      "But the cooking deteriorated, and became execrable; the wine, which had\n",
      "always been bad, became fearfully bad. Nevertheless, Courfeyrac and his\n",
      "friends continued to go to Corinthe,—out of pity, as Bossuet said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Widow Hucheloup was breathless and misshapen and given to rustic\n",
      "recollections. She deprived them of their flatness by her\n",
      "pronunciation. She had a way of her own of saying things, which spiced\n",
      "her reminiscences of the village and of her springtime. It had formerly\n",
      "been her delight, so she affirmed, to hear the _loups-de-gorge_\n",

      "large and long apartment encumbered with stools, chairs, benches, and\n",
      "tables, and with a crippled, lame, old billiard-table. It was reached\n",
      "by a spiral staircase which terminated in the corner of the room at a\n",
      "square hole like the hatchway of a ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "This room, lighted by a single narrow window, and by a lamp that was\n",
      "always burning, had the air of a garret. All the four-footed furniture\n",
      "comported itself as though it had but three legs—the whitewashed walls\n",
      "had for their only ornament the following quatrain in honor of Mame\n",

      "serving-maids, named Matelote and Gibelotte,49 and who had never been\n",
      "known by any other names, helped Mame Hucheloup to set on the tables\n",
      "the jugs of poor wine, and the various broths which were served to the\n",
      "hungry patrons in earthenware bowls. Matelote, large, plump, redhaired,\n",
      "and noisy, the favorite ex-sultana of the defunct Hucheloup, was\n",
      "homelier than any mythological monster, be it what it may; still, as it\n",
      "becomes the servant to always keep in the rear of the mistress, she was\n",
      "less homely than Mame Hucheloup. Gibelotte, tall, delicate, white with\n",
      "a lymphatic pallor, with circles round her eyes, and drooping lids,\n",
      "always languid and weary, afflicted with what may be called chronic\n",
      "lassitude, the first up in the house and the last in bed, waited on\n",
      "every one, even the other maid, silently and gently, smiling through\n",

      "everything in common, even Musichetta, to some extent. They were, what\n",
      "the subordinate monks who accompany monks are called, _bini_. On the\n",
      "morning of the 5th of June, they went to Corinthe to breakfast. Joly,\n",
      "who was all stuffed up, had a catarrh which Laigle was beginning to\n",
      "share. Laigle’s coat was threadbare, but Joly was well dressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about nine o’clock in the morning, when they opened the door of\n",

      "While they were busy with their first oysters, a head appeared at the\n",

      "“I am passing by. I smell from the street a delicious odor of Brie\n",

      "\n",

      "“Ah, by the way, Laigle of the funeral oration, your coat is old.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should hope so,” retorted Laigle. “That’s why we get on well\n",

      "me anywhere, it is moulded on my deformities, it falls in with all my\n",

      "former days there were nothing but convents here! In this neighborhood!\n",
      "Du Breul and Sauval give a list of them, and so does the Abbé Lebeuf.\n",
      "They were all round here, they fairly swarmed, booted and barefooted,\n",
      "shaven, bearded, gray, black, white, Franciscans, Minims, Capuchins,\n",

      "possession of me again. The oysters are spoiled, the servants are ugly.\n",
      "I hate the human race. I just passed through the Rue Richelieu, in\n",
      "front of the big public library. That pile of oyster-shells which is\n",
      "called a library is disgusting even to think of. What paper! What ink!\n",
      "What scrawling! And all that has been written! What rascal was it who\n",
      "said that man was a featherless biped?51 And then, I met a pretty girl\n",
      "of my acquaintance, who is as beautiful as the spring, worthy to be\n",
      "called Floréal, and who is delighted, enraptured, as happy as the\n",
      "angels, because a wretch yesterday, a frightful banker all spotted with\n",
      "small-pox, deigned to take a fancy to her! Alas! woman keeps on the\n",
      "watch for a protector as much as for a lover; cats chase mice as well\n",
      "as birds. Two months ago that young woman was virtuous in an attic, she\n",
      "adjusted little brass rings in the eyelet-holes of corsets, what do you\n",
      "call it? She sewed, she had a camp bed, she dwelt beside a pot of\n",
      "flowers, she was contented. Now here she is a bankeress. This\n",
      "transformation took place last night. I met the victim this morning in\n",
      "high spirits. The hideous point about it is, that the jade is as pretty\n",
      "to-day as she was yesterday. Her financier did not show in her face.\n",
      "Roses have this advantage or disadvantage over women, that the traces\n",
      "left upon them by caterpillars are visible. Ah! there is no morality on\n",
      "earth. I call to witness the myrtle, the symbol of love, the laurel,\n",
      "the symbol of air, the olive, that ninny, the symbol of peace, the\n",
      "apple-tree which came nearest rangling Adam with its pips, and the\n",
      "fig-tree, the grandfather of petticoats. As for right, do you know what\n",
      "right is? The Gauls covet Clusium, Rome protects Clusium, and demands\n",
      "what wrong Clusium has done to them. Brennus answers: ‘The wrong that\n",
      "Alba did to you, the wrong that Fidenæ did to you, the wrong that the\n",
      "Eques, the Volsci, and the Sabines have done to you. They were your\n",

      "\n",
      "“Brennus, who takes Rome, is an eagle; the banker who takes the\n",

      "the other. So we believe in nothing. There is but one reality: drink.\n",
      "Whatever your opinion may be in favor of the lean cock, like the Canton\n",
      "of Uri, or in favor of the fat cock, like the Canton of Glaris, it\n",

      "There is a hitch, it won’t work. Quick, a revolution! The good God has\n",

      "place, I’d be perfectly simple about it, I would not wind up my\n",
      "mechanism every minute, I’d lead the human race in a straightforward\n",
      "way, I’d weave matters mesh by mesh, without breaking the thread, I\n",
      "would have no provisional arrangements, I would have no extraordinary\n",
      "repertory. What the rest of you call progress advances by means of two\n",
      "motors, men and events. But, sad to say, from time to time, the\n",
      "exceptional becomes necessary. The ordinary troupe suffices neither for\n",
      "event nor for men: among men geniuses are required, among events\n",
      "revolutions. Great accidents are the law; the order of things cannot do\n",
      "without them; and, judging from the apparition of comets, one would be\n",
      "tempted to think that Heaven itself finds actors needed for its\n",
      "performance. At the moment when one expects it the least, God placards\n",
      "a meteor on the wall of the firmament. Some queer star turns up,\n",
      "underlined by an enormous tail. And that causes the death of Cæsar.\n",
      "Brutus deals him a blow with a knife, and God a blow with a comet.\n",

      "gathered from exception, seem magnificence and poverty. My friends,\n",
      "Providence has come down to expedients. What does a revolution prove?\n",
      "That God is in a quandry. He effects a _coup d’état_ because he, God,\n",
      "has not been able to make both ends meet. In fact, this confirms me in\n",
      "my conjectures as to Jehovah’s fortune; and when I see so much distress\n",
      "in heaven and on earth, from the bird who has not a grain of millet to\n",
      "myself without a hundred thousand livres of income, when I see human\n",
      "destiny, which is very badly worn, and even royal destiny, which is\n",
      "threadbare, witness the Prince de Condé hung, when I see winter, which\n",

      "I see so many rags even in the perfectly new purple of the morning on\n",
      "the crests of hills, when I see the drops of dew, those mock pearls,\n",
      "when I see the frost, that paste, when I see humanity ripped apart and\n",
      "events patched up, and so many spots on the sun and so many holes in\n",
      "the moon, when I see so much misery everywhere, I suspect that God is\n",
      "not rich. The appearance exists, it is true, but I feel that he is hard\n",
      "up. He gives a revolution as a tradesman whose money-box is empty gives\n",
      "a ball. God must not be judged from appearances. Beneath the gilding of\n",
      "heaven I perceive a poverty-stricken universe. Creation is bankrupt.\n",

      "\n",
      "“That is the pure-bred gamin. There are a great many varieties of the\n",
      "gamin species. The notary’s gamin is called Skip-the-Gutter, the cook’s\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think much of your revolution,” said Grantaire. “I don’t\n",

      "night-cap. It is a sceptre ending in an umbrella. In fact, I think that\n",
      "to-day, with the present weather, Louis Philippe might utilize his\n",
      "royalty in two directions, he might extend the tip of the sceptre end\n",
      "against the people, and open the umbrella end against heaven.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was dark, large clouds had just finished the extinction of\n",

      "one having gone off “to watch events.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it midday or midnight?” cried Bossuet. “You can’t see your hand\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Grantaire was drinking in a melancholy way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Enjolras disdains me,” he muttered. “Enjolras said: ‘Joly is ill,\n",
      "Grantaire is drunk.’ It was to Bossuet that he sent Navet. If he had\n",
      "come for me, I would have followed him. So much the worse for Enjolras!\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This resolution once arrived at, Bossuet, Joly, and Grantaire did not\n",
      "stir from the wine-shop. By two o’clock in the afternoon, the table at\n",
      "which they sat was covered with empty bottles. Two candles were burning\n",
      "on it, one in a flat copper candlestick which was perfectly green, the\n",
      "other in the neck of a cracked carafe. Grantaire had seduced Joly and\n",
      "Bossuet to wine; Bossuet and Joly had conducted Grantaire back towards\n",
      "cheerfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Grantaire, he had got beyond wine, that merely moderate inspirer\n",
      "of dreams, ever since midday. Wine enjoys only a conventional\n",
      "popularity with serious drinkers. There is, in fact, in the matter of\n",
      "inebriety, white magic and black magic; wine is only white magic.\n",
      "Grantaire was a daring drinker of dreams. The blackness of a terrible\n",
      "fit of drunkenness yawning before him, far from arresting him,\n",
      "attracted him. He had abandoned the bottle and taken to the beerglass.\n",
      "The beer-glass is the abyss. Having neither opium nor hashish on hand,\n",
      "and being desirous of filling his brain with twilight, he had had\n",
      "recourse to that fearful mixture of brandy, stout, absinthe, which\n",
      "produces the most terrible of lethargies. It is of these three vapors,\n",
      "beer, brandy, and absinthe, that the lead of the soul is composed. They\n",
      "are three grooms; the celestial butterfly is drowned in them; and there\n",
      "are formed there in a membranous smoke, vaguely condensed into the wing\n",
      "of the bat, three mute furies, Nightmare, Night, and Death, which hover\n",
      "about the slumbering Psyche.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grantaire had not yet reached that lamentable phase; far from it. He\n",
      "was tremendously gay, and Bossuet and Joly retorted. They clinked\n",
      "glasses. Grantaire added to the eccentric accentuation of words and\n",
      "ideas, a peculiarity of gesture; he rested his left fist on his knee\n",
      "with dignity, his arm forming a right angle, and, with cravat untied,\n",
      "seated astride a stool, his full glass in his right hand, he hurled\n",
      "solemn words at the big maid-servant Matelote:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let the doors of the palace be thrown open! Let every one be a member\n",
      "of the French Academy and have the right to embrace Madame Hucheloup.\n",
      "Let us drink.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And turning to Madame Hucheloup, he added:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Woman ancient and consecrated by use, draw near that I may contemplate\n",
      "thee!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And Joly exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Matelote and Gibelotte, dod’t gib Grantaire anything more to drink. He\n",
      "has already devoured, since this bording, in wild prodigality, two\n",
      "francs and ninety-five centibes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And Grantaire began again:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who has been unhooking the stars without my permission, and putting\n",
      "them on the table in the guise of candles?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bossuet, though very drunk, preserved his equanimity.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was seated on the sill of the open window, wetting his back in the\n",
      "falling rain, and gazing at his two friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once, he heard a tumult behind him, hurried footsteps, cries of\n",
      "“To arms!” He turned round and saw in the Rue Saint-Denis, at the end\n",
      "of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, Enjolras passing, gun in hand, and\n",
      "Gavroche with his pistol, Feuilly with his sword, Courfeyrac with his\n",
      "sword, and Jean Prouvaire with his blunderbuss, Combeferre with his\n",
      "gun, Bahorel with his gun, and the whole armed and stormy rabble which\n",
      "was following them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rue de la Chanvrerie was not more than a gunshot long. Bossuet\n",
      "improvised a speaking-trumpet from his two hands placed around his\n",
      "mouth, and shouted:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Courfeyrac! Courfeyrac! Hohée!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Courfeyrac heard the shout, caught sight of Bossuet, and advanced a few\n",
      "paces into the Rue de la Chanvrerie, shouting: “What do you want?”\n",
      "which crossed a “Where are you going?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“To make a barricade,” replied Courfeyrac.\n",

      "“Well, here! This is a good place! Make it here!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s true, Aigle,” said Courfeyrac.\n",

      "The spot was, in fact, admirably adapted, the entrance to the street\n",
      "widened out, the other extremity narrowed together into a pocket\n",
      "without exit. Corinthe created an obstacle, the Rue Mondétour was\n",
      "easily barricaded on the right and the left, no attack was possible\n",
      "except from the Rue Saint-Denis, that is to say, in front, and in full\n",

      "\n",
      "Terror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of the mob.\n",
      "There was not a passer-by who did not get out of sight. In the space of\n",
      "a flash of lightning, in the rear, to right and left, shops, stables,\n",
      "area-doors, windows, blinds, attic skylights, shutters of every\n",
      "description were closed, from the ground floor to the roof. A terrified\n",
      "old woman fixed a mattress in front of her window on two clothes-poles\n",
      "for drying linen, in order to deaden the effect of musketry. The\n",
      "wine-shop alone remained open; and that for a very good reason, that\n",
      "the mob had rushed into it.—“Ah my God! Ah my God!” sighed Mame\n",
      "Hucheloup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bossuet had gone down to meet Courfeyrac.\n",

      "dray contained three barrels of lime, which they placed beneath the\n",
      "piles of paving-stones: Enjolras raised the cellar trap, and all the\n",
      "widow Hucheloup’s empty casks were used to flank the barrels of lime;\n",
      "Feuilly, with his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of\n",
      "fans, had backed up the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of\n",
      "blocks of rough stone. Blocks which were improvised like the rest and\n",
      "procured no one knows where. The beams which served as props were torn\n",
      "from the neighboring house-fronts and laid on the casks. When Bossuet\n",
      "and Courfeyrac turned round, half the street was already barred with a\n",
      "rampart higher than a man. There is nothing like the hand of the\n",
      "populace for building everything that is built by demolishing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matelote and Gibelotte had mingled with the workers. Gibelotte went and\n",

      "\n",
      "An omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bossuet strode over the paving-stones, ran to it, stopped the driver,\n",

      "Enjolras felt attacked by that impatience which seizes on strong souls\n",
      "on the threshold of redoubtable events. He went in search of Gavroche,\n",
      "who had set to making cartridges in the tap-room, by the dubious light\n",
      "of two candles placed on the counter by way of precaution, on account\n",
      "of the powder which was scattered on the tables. These two candles cast\n",
      "no gleam outside. The insurgents had, moreover, taken pains not to have\n",
      "any light in the upper stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment, but not precisely with\n",
      "his cartridges. The man of the Rue des Billettes had just entered the\n",
      "tap-room and had seated himself at the table which was the least\n",
      "lighted. A musket of large model had fallen to his share, and he held\n",
      "it between his legs. Gavroche, who had been, up to that moment,\n",
      "distracted by a hundred “amusing” things, had not even seen this man.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he entered, Gavroche followed him mechanically with his eyes,\n",
      "admiring his gun; then, all at once, when the man was seated, the\n",
      "street urchin sprang to his feet. Any one who had spied upon that man\n",
      "up to that moment, would have seen that he was observing everything in\n",
      "the barricade and in the band of insurgents, with singular attention;\n",
      "but, from the moment when he had entered this room, he had fallen into\n",
      "a sort of brown study, and no longer seemed to see anything that was\n",
      "going on. The gamin approached this pensive personage, and began to\n",
      "step around him on tiptoe, as one walks in the vicinity of a person\n",
      "whom one is afraid of waking. At the same time, over his childish\n",
      "countenance which was, at once so impudent and so serious, so giddy and\n",
      "so profound, so gay and so heart-breaking, passed all those grimaces of\n",
      "an old man which signify: Ah bah! impossible! My sight is bad! I am\n",
      "dreaming! can this be? no, it is not! but yes! why, no! etc. Gavroche\n",
      "balanced on his heels, clenched both fists in his pockets, moved his\n",
      "neck around like a bird, expended in a gigantic pout all the sagacity\n",
      "of his lower lip. He was astounded, uncertain, incredulous, convinced,\n",
      "dazzled. He had the mien of the chief of the eunuchs in the slave mart,\n",
      "discovering a Venus among the blowsy females, and the air of an amateur\n",
      "recognizing a Raphael in a heap of daubs. His whole being was at work,\n",
      "the instinct which scents out, and the intelligence which combines. It\n",
      "was evident that a great event had happened in Gavroche’s life.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that Enjolras\n",
      "accosted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are small,” said Enjolras, “you will not be seen. Go out of the\n",
      "barricade, slip along close to the houses, skirmish about a bit in the\n",
      "streets, and come back and tell me what is going on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche raised himself on his haunches.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So the little chaps are good for something! that’s very lucky! I’ll\n",
      "go! In the meanwhile, trust to the little fellows, and distrust the big\n",
      "ones.” And Gavroche, raising his head and lowering his voice, added, as\n",
      "he indicated the man of the Rue des Billettes: “Do you see that big\n",
      "fellow there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s a police spy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you sure of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It isn’t two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice of the Port\n",
      "Royal, where I was taking the air, by my ear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjolras hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a very\n",
      "low tone to a longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced to be at\n",
      "hand. The man left the room, and returned almost immediately,\n",
      "accompanied by three others. The four men, four porters with broad\n",
      "shoulders, went and placed themselves without doing anything to attract\n",
      "his attention, behind the table on which the man of the Rue des\n",
      "Billettes was leaning with his elbows. They were evidently ready to\n",
      "hurl themselves upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Enjolras approached the man and demanded of him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At this abrupt query, the man started. He plunged his gaze deep into\n",
      "Enjolras’ clear eyes and appeared to grasp the latter’s meaning. He\n",
      "smiled with a smile than which nothing more disdainful, more energetic,\n",
      "and more resolute could be seen in the world, and replied with haughty\n",
      "gravity:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see what it is. Well, yes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a police spy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am an agent of the authorities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And your name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Javert.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjolras made a sign to the four men. In the twinkling of an eye,\n",
      "before Javert had time to turn round, he was collared, thrown down,\n",
      "pinioned and searched.\n",
      "\n",
      "They found on him a little round card pasted between two pieces of\n",
      "glass, and bearing on one side the arms of France, engraved, and with\n",
      "this motto: _Supervision and vigilance_, and on the other this note:\n",
      "“JAVERT, inspector of police, aged fifty-two,” and the signature of the\n",
      "Prefect of Police of that day, M. Gisquet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides this, he had his watch and his purse, which contained several\n",
      "gold pieces. They left him his purse and his watch. Under the watch, at\n",
      "the bottom of his fob, they felt and seized a paper in an envelope,\n",
      "which Enjolras unfolded, and on which he read these five lines, written\n",
      "in the very hand of the Prefect of Police:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“As soon as his political mission is accomplished, Inspector Javert\n",
      "will make sure, by special supervision, whether it is true that the\n",
      "malefactors have instituted intrigues on the right bank of the Seine,\n",
      "near the Jena bridge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The search ended, they lifted Javert to his feet, bound his arms behind\n",
      "his back, and fastened him to that celebrated post in the middle of the\n",
      "room which had formerly given the wine-shop its name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche, who had looked on at the whole of this scene and had approved\n",
      "of everything with a silent toss of his head, stepped up to Javert and\n",
      "said to him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the mouse who has caught the cat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All this was so rapidly executed, that it was all over when those about\n",
      "the wine-shop noticed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert had not uttered a single cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the sight of Javert bound to the post, Courfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly,\n",
      "Combeferre, and the men scattered over the two barricades came running\n",
      "up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert, with his back to the post, and so surrounded with ropes that he\n",
      "could not make a movement, raised his head with the intrepid serenity\n",
      "of the man who has never lied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is a police spy,” said Enjolras.\n",
      "\n",
      "And turning to Javert: “You will be shot ten minutes before the\n",
      "barricade is taken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Javert replied in his most imperious tone:—\n",

      "“We are saving our powder.”\n",

      "“Spy,” said the handsome Enjolras, “we are judges and not assassins.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "“Here you! go about your business! Do what I told you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m going!” cried Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "And halting as he was on the point of setting out:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the way, you will give me his gun!” and he added: “I leave you the\n",
      "musician, but I want the clarinet.”\n",

      "the jacket of a street porter, which was very threadbare on the\n",
      "shoulders, who gesticulated and vociferated, and who had the look of a\n",
      "drunken savage. This man, whose name or nickname was Le Cabuc, and who\n",
      "was, moreover, an utter stranger to those who pretended to know him,\n",
      "was very drunk, or assumed the appearance of being so, and had seated\n",
      "himself with several others at a table which they had dragged outside\n",
      "of the wine-shop. This Cabuc, while making those who vied with him\n",
      "drunk seemed to be examining with a thoughtful air the large house at\n",
      "the extremity of the barricade, whose five stories commanded the whole\n",
      "street and faced the Rue Saint-Denis. All at once he exclaimed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know, comrades, it is from that house yonder that we must fire.\n",
      "When we are at the windows, the deuce is in it if any one can advance\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Let us break in the door!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Le Cabuc runs to the door, which had a very massive knocker, and\n",
      "knocks. The door opens not. He strikes a second blow. No one answers. A\n",
      "third stroke. The same silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there any one here?” shouts Cabuc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing stirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he seizes a gun and begins to batter the door with the butt end.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an ancient alley door, low, vaulted, narrow, solid, entirely of\n",
      "oak, lined on the inside with a sheet of iron and iron stays, a genuine\n",
      "prison postern. The blows from the butt end of the gun made the house\n",
      "tremble, but did not shake the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed, for a\n",
      "tiny, square window was finally seen to open on the third story, and at\n",
      "this aperture appeared the reverend and terrified face of a gray-haired\n",
      "old man, who was the porter, and who held a candle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man who was knocking paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gentlemen,” said the porter, “what do you want?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The old man fell back without a sigh. The candle fell and was\n",

      "\n",
      "Le Cabuc attempted to resist, but he seemed to have been seized by a\n",
      "superhuman hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjolras, pale, with bare neck and dishevelled hair, and his woman’s\n",
      "face, had about him at that moment something of the antique Themis. His\n",
      "dilated nostrils, his downcast eyes, gave to his implacable Greek\n",

      "\n",

      "by the hair, as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his knees and\n",
      "shrieked, and placed the muzzle of the pistol to his ear. Many of those\n",
      "intrepid men, who had so tranquilly entered upon the most terrible of\n",

      "\n",
      "An explosion was heard, the assassin fell to the pavement face\n",
      "downwards.\n",
      "\n",

      "voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "A silence fell upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Citizens,” said Enjolras, “what that man did is frightful, what I have\n",
      "done is horrible. He killed, therefore I killed him. I had to do it,\n",
      "because insurrection must have its discipline. Assassination is even\n",
      "more of a crime here than elsewhere; we are under the eyes of the\n",
      "Revolution, we are the priests of the Republic, we are the victims of\n",
      "duty, and must not be possible to slander our combat. I have,\n",
      "therefore, tried that man, and condemned him to death. As for myself,\n",
      "constrained as I am to do what I have done, and yet abhorring it, I\n",
      "have judged myself also, and you shall soon see to what I have\n",
      "condemned myself.”\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“We will share thy fate,” cried Combeferre.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So be it,” replied Enjolras. “One word more. In executing this man, I\n",
      "have obeyed necessity; but necessity is a monster of the old world,\n",
      "necessity’s name is Fatality. Now, the law of progress is, that\n",
      "monsters shall disappear before the angels, and that Fatality shall\n",
      "vanish before Fraternity. It is a bad moment to pronounce the word\n",
      "love. No matter, I do pronounce it. And I glorify it. Love, the future\n",
      "is thine. Death, I make use of thee, but I hate thee. Citizens, in the\n",
      "future there will be neither darkness nor thunderbolts; neither\n",
      "ferocious ignorance, nor bloody retaliation. As there will be no more\n",
      "Satan, there will be no more Michael. In the future no one will kill\n",
      "any one else, the earth will beam with radiance, the human race will\n",
      "love. The day will come, citizens, when all will be concord, harmony,\n",
      "light, joy and life; it will come, and it is in order that it may come\n",
      "that we are about to die.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjolras ceased. His virgin lips closed; and he remained for some time\n",
      "standing on the spot where he had shed blood, in marble immobility. His\n",
      "staring eye caused those about him to speak in low tones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Prouvaire and Combeferre pressed each other’s hands silently, and,\n",
      "leaning against each other in an angle of the barricade, they watched\n",
      "with an admiration in which there was some compassion, that grave young\n",
      "man, executioner and priest, composed of light, like crystal, and also\n",
      "of rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us say at once that later on, after the action, when the bodies\n",
      "were taken to the morgue and searched, a police agent’s card was found\n",
      "on Le Cabuc. The author of this book had in his hands, in 1848, the\n",
      "special report on this subject made to the Prefect of Police in 1832.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will add, that if we are to believe a tradition of the police, which\n",
      "is strange but probably well founded, Le Cabuc was Claquesous. The fact\n",
      "is, that dating from the death of Le Cabuc, there was no longer any\n",
      "question of Claquesous. Claquesous had nowhere left any trace of his\n",
      "disappearance; he would seem to have amalgamated himself with the\n",
      "invisible. His life had been all shadows, his end was night.\n",

      "young man who had inquired of him that morning for Marius.\n",

      "The voice which had summoned Marius through the twilight to the\n",
      "barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, had produced on him the effect\n",
      "of the voice of destiny. He wished to die; the opportunity presented\n",
      "itself; he knocked at the door of the tomb, a hand in the darkness\n",
      "offered him the key. These melancholy openings which take place in the\n",
      "gloom before despair, are tempting. Marius thrust aside the bar which\n",
      "had so often allowed him to pass, emerged from the garden, and said: “I\n",
      "will go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mad with grief, no longer conscious of anything fixed or solid in his\n",
      "brain, incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate after those\n",
      "two months passed in the intoxication of youth and love, overwhelmed at\n",
      "once by all the reveries of despair, he had but one desire remaining,\n",
      "to make a speedy end of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "He set out at rapid pace. He found himself most opportunely armed, as\n",
      "he had Javert’s pistols with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man of whom he thought that he had caught a glimpse, had\n",
      "vanished from his sight in the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius, who had emerged from the Rue Plumet by the boulevard, traversed\n",
      "the Esplanade and the bridge of the Invalides, the Champs-Élysées, the\n",
      "Place Louis XV., and reached the Rue de Rivoli. The shops were open\n",
      "there, the gas was burning under the arcades, women were making their\n",
      "purchases in the stalls, people were eating ices in the Café Laiter,\n",
      "and nibbling small cakes at the English pastry-cook’s shop. Only a few\n",
      "posting-chaises were setting out at a gallop from the Hôtel des Princes\n",
      "and the Hôtel Meurice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius entered the Rue Saint-Honoré through the Passage Delorme. There\n",
      "the shops were closed, the merchants were chatting in front of their\n",
      "half-open doors, people were walking about, the street lanterns were\n",
      "lighted, beginning with the first floor, all the windows were lighted\n",
      "as usual. There was cavalry on the Place du Palais-Royal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius followed the Rue Saint-Honoré. In proportion as he left the\n",
      "Palais-Royal behind him, there were fewer lighted windows, the shops\n",
      "were fast shut, no one was chatting on the thresholds, the street grew\n",
      "sombre, and, at the same time, the crowd increased in density. For the\n",
      "passers-by now amounted to a crowd. No one could be seen to speak in\n",
      "this throng, and yet there arose from it a dull, deep murmur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Near the fountain of the Arbre-Sec, there were “assemblages”,\n",
      "motionless and gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as\n",
      "stones in the midst of running water.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the entrance to the Rue des Prouvaires, the crowd no longer walked.\n",
      "It formed a resisting, massive, solid, compact, almost impenetrable\n",
      "block of people who were huddled together, and conversing in low tones.\n",
      "There were hardly any black coats or round hats now, but smock frocks,\n",
      "blouses, caps, and bristling and cadaverous heads. This multitude\n",
      "undulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom. Its whisperings had the\n",
      "hoarse accent of a vibration. Although not one of them was walking, a\n",
      "dull trampling was audible in the mire. Beyond this dense portion of\n",
      "the throng, in the Rue du Roule, in the Rue des Prouvaires, and in the\n",
      "extension of the Rue Saint-Honoré, there was no longer a single window\n",
      "in which a candle was burning. Only the solitary and diminishing rows\n",
      "of lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the distance.\n",
      "The lanterns of that date resembled large red stars, hanging to ropes,\n",
      "and shed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge\n",
      "spider. These streets were not deserted. There could be descried piles\n",
      "of guns, moving bayonets, and troops bivouacking. No curious observer\n",
      "passed that limit. There circulation ceased. There the rabble ended and\n",
      "the army began.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more. He had been\n",
      "summoned, he must go. He found a means to traverse the throng and to\n",
      "pass the bivouac of the troops, he shunned the patrols, he avoided the\n",
      "sentinels. He made a circuit, reached the Rue de Béthisy, and directed\n",
      "his course towards the Halles. At the corner of the Rue des\n",
      "Bourdonnais, there were no longer any lanterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "After having passed the zone of the crowd, he had passed the limits of\n",
      "the troops; he found himself in something startling. There was no\n",
      "longer a passer-by, no longer a soldier, no longer a light, there was\n",
      "no one; solitude, silence, night, I know not what chill which seized\n",
      "hold upon one. Entering a street was like entering a cellar.\n",
      "\n",
      "He continued to advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took a few steps. Some one passed close to him at a run. Was it a\n",
      "man? Or a woman? Were there many of them? he could not have told. It\n",
      "had passed and vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proceeding from circuit to circuit, he reached a lane which he judged\n",
      "to be the Rue de la Poterie; near the middle of this street, he came in\n",
      "contact with an obstacle. He extended his hands. It was an overturned\n",
      "wagon; his foot recognized pools of water, gullies, and paving-stones\n",
      "scattered and piled up. A barricade had been begun there and abandoned.\n",
      "He climbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of the\n",
      "barrier. He walked very near the street-posts, and guided himself along\n",
      "the walls of the houses. A little beyond the barricade, it seemed to\n",
      "him that he could make out something white in front of him. He\n",
      "approached, it took on a form. It was two white horses; the horses of\n",
      "the omnibus harnessed by Bossuet in the morning, who had been straying\n",
      "at random all day from street to street, and had finally halted there,\n",
      "with the weary patience of brutes who no more understand the actions of\n",
      "men, than man understands the actions of Providence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius left the horses behind him. As he was approaching a street which\n",
      "seemed to him to be the Rue du Contrat-Social, a shot coming no one\n",
      "knows whence, and traversing the darkness at random, whistled close by\n",
      "him, and the bullet pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended above his\n",
      "head over a hairdresser’s shop. This pierced shaving-dish was still to\n",
      "be seen in 1848, in the Rue du Contrat-Social, at the corner of the\n",
      "pillars of the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "This shot still betokened life. From that instant forth he encountered\n",
      "nothing more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "A being who could have hovered over Paris that night with the wing of\n",
      "the bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that old quarter of the Halles, which is like a city within a city,\n",
      "through which run the Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, where a\n",
      "thousand lanes cross, and of which the insurgents had made their\n",
      "redoubt and their stronghold, would have appeared to him like a dark\n",
      "and enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of Paris. There the\n",
      "glance fell into an abyss. Thanks to the broken lanterns, thanks to the\n",
      "closed windows, there all radiance, all life, all sound, all movement\n",
      "ceased. The invisible police of the insurrection were on the watch\n",
      "everywhere, and maintained order, that is to say, night. The necessary\n",
      "tactics of insurrection are to drown small numbers in a vast obscurity,\n",
      "to multiply every combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity\n",
      "contains. At dusk, every window where a candle was burning received a\n",
      "shot. The light was extinguished, sometimes the inhabitant was killed.\n",
      "Hence nothing was stirring. There was nothing but fright, mourning,\n",
      "stupor in the houses; and in the streets, a sort of sacred horror. Not\n",
      "even the long rows of windows and stores, the indentations of the\n",
      "chimneys, and the roofs, and the vague reflections which are cast back\n",
      "by the wet and muddy pavements, were visible. An eye cast upward at\n",
      "that mass of shadows might, perhaps, have caught a glimpse here and\n",
      "there, at intervals, of indistinct gleams which brought out broken and\n",
      "eccentric lines, and profiles of singular buildings, something like the\n",
      "lights which go and come in ruins; it was at such points that the\n",
      "barricades were situated. The rest was a lake of obscurity, foggy,\n",
      "heavy, and funereal, above which, in motionless and melancholy\n",
      "outlines, rose the tower of Saint-Jacques, the church of Saint-Merry,\n",
      "and two or three more of those grand edifices of which man makes giants\n",
      "and the night makes phantoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "All around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth, in the quarters\n",
      "where the Parisian circulation had not been annihilated, and where a\n",
      "few street lanterns still burned, the aerial observer might have\n",
      "distinguished the metallic gleam of swords and bayonets, the dull\n",
      "rumble of artillery, and the swarming of silent battalions whose ranks\n",
      "were swelling from minute to minute; a formidable girdle which was\n",
      "slowly drawing in and around the insurrection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrous\n",
      "cavern; everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless, and, as\n",
      "we have just seen, any street which one might come to offered nothing\n",
      "but darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "A wild darkness, full of traps, full of unseen and formidable shocks,\n",
      "into which it was alarming to penetrate, and in which it was terrible\n",
      "to remain, where those who entered shivered before those whom they\n",
      "awaited, where those who waited shuddered before those who were coming.\n",
      "Invisible combatants were entrenched at every corner of the street;\n",
      "snares of the sepulchre concealed in the density of night. All was\n",
      "over. No more light was to be hoped for, henceforth, except the\n",
      "lightning of guns, no further encounter except the abrupt and rapid\n",
      "apparition of death. Where? How? When? No one knew, but it was certain\n",
      "and inevitable. In this place which had been marked out for the\n",
      "struggle, the Government and the insurrection, the National Guard, and\n",
      "popular societies, the bourgeois and the uprising, groping their way,\n",
      "were about to come into contact. The necessity was the same for both.\n",
      "The only possible issue thenceforth was to emerge thence killed or\n",
      "conquerors. A situation so extreme, an obscurity so powerful, that the\n",
      "most timid felt themselves seized with resolution, and the most daring\n",
      "with terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, on both sides, the fury, the rage, and the determination were\n",
      "equal. For the one party, to advance meant death, and no one dreamed of\n",
      "retreating; for the other, to remain meant death, and no one dreamed of\n",
      "flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day,\n",
      "that triumph should rest either here or there, that the insurrection\n",
      "should prove itself a revolution or a skirmish. The Government\n",
      "understood this as well as the parties; the most insignificant\n",
      "bourgeois felt it. Hence a thought of anguish which mingled with the\n",
      "impenetrable gloom of this quarter where all was at the point of being\n",
      "decided; hence a redoubled anxiety around that silence whence a\n",
      "catastrophe was on the point of emerging. Here only one sound was\n",
      "audible, a sound as heart-rending as the death rattle, as menacing as a\n",
      "malediction, the tocsin of Saint-Merry. Nothing could be more\n",
      "blood-curdling than the clamor of that wild and desperate bell, wailing\n",
      "amid the shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it often happens, nature seemed to have fallen into accord with what\n",
      "men were about to do. Nothing disturbed the harmony of the whole\n",
      "effect. The stars had disappeared, heavy clouds filled the horizon with\n",
      "their melancholy folds. A black sky rested on these dead streets, as\n",
      "though an immense winding-sheet were being outspread over this immense\n",
      "tomb.\n",
      "\n",
      "While a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation in\n",
      "the same locality which had already witnessed so many revolutionary\n",
      "events, while youth, the secret associations, the schools, in the name\n",
      "of principles, and the middle classes, in the name of interests, were\n",
      "approaching preparatory to dashing themselves together, clasping and\n",
      "throwing each other, while each one hastened and invited the last and\n",
      "decisive hour of the crisis, far away and quite outside of this fatal\n",
      "quarter, in the most profound depths of the unfathomable cavities of\n",
      "that wretched old Paris which disappears under the splendor of happy\n",
      "and opulent Paris, the sombre voice of the people could be heard giving\n",
      "utterance to a dull roar.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fearful and sacred voice which is composed of the roar of the brute\n",
      "and of the word of God, which terrifies the weak and which warns the\n",
      "wise, which comes both from below like the voice of the lion, and from\n",
      "on high like the voice of the thunder.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius had reached the Halles.\n",
      "\n",
      "There everything was still calmer, more obscure and more motionless\n",
      "than in the neighboring streets. One would have said that the glacial\n",
      "peace of the sepulchre had sprung forth from the earth and had spread\n",
      "over the heavens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, a red glow brought out against this black background the\n",
      "lofty roofs of the houses which barred the Rue de la Chanvrerie on the\n",
      "Saint-Eustache side. It was the reflection of the torch which was\n",
      "burning in the Corinthe barricade. Marius directed his steps towards\n",
      "that red light. It had drawn him to the Marché-aux-Poirées, and he\n",
      "caught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the Rue des Prêcheurs. He entered\n",
      "it. The insurgents’ sentinel, who was guarding the other end, did not\n",
      "see him. He felt that he was very close to that which he had come in\n",
      "search of, and he walked on tiptoe. In this manner he reached the elbow\n",
      "of that short section of the Rue Mondétour which was, as the reader\n",
      "will remember, the only communication which Enjolras had preserved with\n",
      "the outside world. At the corner of the last house, on his left, he\n",
      "thrust his head forward, and looked into the fragment of the Rue\n",
      "Mondétour.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little beyond the angle of the lane and the Rue de la Chanvrerie\n",
      "which cast a broad curtain of shadow, in which he was himself engulfed,\n",
      "he perceived some light on the pavement, a bit of the wine-shop, and\n",
      "beyond, a flickering lamp within a sort of shapeless wall, and men\n",
      "crouching down with guns on their knees. All this was ten fathoms\n",
      "distant from him. It was the interior of the barricade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The houses which bordered the lane on the right concealed the rest of\n",
      "the wine-shop, the large barricade, and the flag from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marius had but a step more to take.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the unhappy young man seated himself on a post, folded his arms,\n",
      "and fell to thinking about his father.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought of that heroic Colonel Pontmercy, who had been so proud a\n",
      "soldier, who had guarded the frontier of France under the Republic, and\n",
      "had touched the frontier of Asia under Napoleon, who had beheld Genoa,\n",
      "Alexandria, Milan, Turin, Madrid, Vienna, Dresden, Berlin, Moscow, who\n",
      "had left on all the victorious battle-fields of Europe drops of that\n",
      "same blood, which he, Marius, had in his veins, who had grown gray\n",
      "before his time in discipline and command, who had lived with his\n",
      "sword-belt buckled, his epaulets falling on his breast, his cockade\n",
      "blackened with powder, his brow furrowed with his helmet, in barracks,\n",
      "in camp, in the bivouac, in ambulances, and who, at the expiration of\n",
      "twenty years, had returned from the great wars with a scarred cheek, a\n",
      "smiling countenance, tranquil, admirable, pure as a child, having done\n",
      "everything for France and nothing against her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said to himself that his day had also come now, that his hour had\n",
      "struck, that following his father, he too was about to show himself\n",
      "brave, intrepid, bold, to run to meet the bullets, to offer his breast\n",
      "to bayonets, to shed his blood, to seek the enemy, to seek death, that\n",
      "he was about to wage war in his turn and descend to the field of\n",
      "battle, and that the field of battle upon which he was to descend was\n",
      "the street, and that the war in which he was about to engage was civil\n",
      "war!\n",
      "\n",
      "He beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him, and into this he\n",
      "was about to fall. Then he shuddered.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought of his father’s sword, which his grandfather had sold to a\n",
      "second-hand dealer, and which he had so mournfully regretted. He said\n",
      "to himself that that chaste and valiant sword had done well to escape\n",
      "from him, and to depart in wrath into the gloom; that if it had thus\n",
      "fled, it was because it was intelligent and because it had foreseen the\n",
      "future; that it had had a presentiment of this rebellion, the war of\n",
      "the gutters, the war of the pavements, fusillades through\n",
      "cellar-windows, blows given and received in the rear; it was because,\n",
      "coming from Marengo and Friedland, it did not wish to go to the Rue de\n",
      "la Chanvrerie; it was because, after what it had done with the father,\n",
      "it did not wish to do this for the son! He told himself that if that\n",
      "sword were there, if after taking possession of it at his father’s\n",
      "pillow, he had dared to take it and carry it off for this combat of\n",
      "darkness between Frenchmen in the streets, it would assuredly have\n",
      "scorched his hands and burst out aflame before his eyes, like the sword\n",
      "of the angel! He told himself that it was fortunate that it was not\n",
      "there and that it had disappeared, that that was well, that that was\n",
      "just, that his grandfather had been the true guardian of his father’s\n",
      "glory, and that it was far better that the colonel’s sword should be\n",
      "sold at auction, sold to the old-clothes man, thrown among the old\n",
      "junk, than that it should, to-day, wound the side of his country.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then he fell to weeping bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was horrible. But what was he to do? Live without Cosette he could\n",
      "not. Since she was gone, he must needs die. Had he not given her his\n",
      "word of honor that he would die? She had gone knowing that; this meant\n",
      "that it pleased her that Marius should die. And then, it was clear that\n",
      "she no longer loved him, since she had departed thus without warning,\n",
      "without a word, without a letter, although she knew his address! What\n",
      "was the good of living, and why should he live now? And then, what!\n",
      "should he retreat after going so far? should he flee from danger after\n",
      "having approached it? should he slip away after having come and peeped\n",
      "into the barricade? slip away, all in a tremble, saying: “After all, I\n",
      "have had enough of it as it is. I have seen it, that suffices, this is\n",
      "civil war, and I shall take my leave!” Should he abandon his friends\n",
      "who were expecting him? Who were in need of him possibly! who were a\n",
      "mere handful against an army! Should he be untrue at once to his love,\n",
      "to country, to his word? Should he give to his cowardice the pretext of\n",
      "patriotism? But this was impossible, and if the phantom of his father\n",
      "was there in the gloom, and beheld him retreating, he would beat him on\n",
      "the loins with the flat of his sword, and shout to him: “March on, you\n",
      "poltroon!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts, he dropped\n",
      "his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once he raised it. A sort of splendid rectification had just\n",
      "been effected in his mind. There is a widening of the sphere of thought\n",
      "which is peculiar to the vicinity of the grave; it makes one see\n",
      "clearly to be near death. The vision of the action into which he felt\n",
      "that he was, perhaps, on the point of entering, appeared to him no more\n",
      "as lamentable, but as superb. The war of the street was suddenly\n",
      "transfigured by some unfathomable inward working of his soul, before\n",
      "the eye of his thought. All the tumultuous interrogation points of\n",
      "reverie recurred to him in throngs, but without troubling him. He left\n",
      "none of them unanswered.\n",
      "\n",

      "used for assassinating the right, progress, reason, civilization,\n",

      "the large barricade, with their heads on a level with the crest of the\n",

      "though at loop-holes, attentive, mute, ready to fire. Six, commanded by\n",

      "but this stony step had something indescribably enormous and multiple\n",
      "about it which awakened the idea of a throng, and, at the same time,\n",
      "the idea of a spectre. One thought one heard the terrible statue Legion\n",
      "marching onward. This tread drew near; it drew still nearer, and\n",
      "stopped. It seemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard\n",
      "at the end of the street. Nothing was to be seen, however, but at the\n",
      "bottom of that dense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude\n",
      "of metallic threads, as fine as needles and almost imperceptible, which\n",
      "moved about like those indescribable phosphoric networks which one sees\n",
      "beneath one’s closed eyelids, in the first mists of slumber at the\n",
      "moment when one is dropping off to sleep. These were bayonets and\n",

      "A pause ensued, as though both sides were waiting. All at once, from\n",
      "the depths of this darkness, a voice, which was all the more sinister,\n",
      "since no one was visible, and which appeared to be the gloom itself\n",
      "speaking, shouted:—\n",

      "The impression produced by this first discharge was freezing. The\n",
      "attack had been rough, and of a nature to inspire reflection in the\n",

      "Not a man responded. To mount on the barricade at the very moment when,\n",

      "Since they had arrived at Corinthe, and had begun the construction of\n",

      "had not quitted the mob, however; he had entered the ground floor of\n",
      "the wine-shop and had seated himself behind the counter. There he had,\n",
      "so to speak, retreated into himself. He no longer seemed to look or to\n",
      "think. Courfeyrac and others had accosted him two or three times,\n",
      "warning him of his peril, beseeching him to withdraw, but he did not\n",
      "hear them. When they were not speaking to him, his mouth moved as\n",
      "though he were replying to some one, and as soon as he was addressed,\n",
      "his lips became motionless and his eyes no longer had the appearance of\n",

      "Several hours before the barricade was attacked, he had assumed an\n",
      "attitude which he did not afterwards abandon, with both fists planted\n",
      "on his knees and his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over\n",
      "a precipice. Nothing had been able to move him from this attitude; it\n",

      "gone to take up his position for the combat, there remained in the\n",
      "tap-room where Javert was bound to the post, only a single insurgent\n",
      "with a naked sword, watching over Javert, and himself, Mabeuf. At the\n",
      "moment of the attack, at the detonation, the physical shock had reached\n",
      "him and had, as it were, awakened him; he started up abruptly, crossed\n",
      "the room, and at the instant when Enjolras repeated his appeal: “Does\n",
      "no one volunteer?” the old man was seen to make his appearance on the\n",
      "threshold of the wine-shop. His presence produced a sort of commotion\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is probable that he did not hear them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He strode straight up to Enjolras, the insurgents withdrawing before\n",
      "him with a religious fear; he tore the flag from Enjolras, who recoiled\n",
      "in amazement and then, since no one dared to stop or to assist him,\n",
      "this old man of eighty, with shaking head but firm foot, began slowly\n",
      "to ascend the staircase of paving-stones arranged in the barricade.\n",
      "This was so melancholy and so grand that all around him cried: “Off\n",
      "with your hats!” At every step that he mounted, it was a frightful\n",
      "spectacle; his white locks, his decrepit face, his lofty, bald, and\n",
      "wrinkled brow, his amazed and open mouth, his aged arm upholding the\n",
      "red banner, rose through the gloom and were enlarged in the bloody\n",
      "light of the torch, and the bystanders thought that they beheld the\n",
      "spectre of ’93 emerging from the earth, with the flag of terror in his\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had reached the last step, when this trembling and terrible\n",
      "phantom, erect on that pile of rubbish in the presence of twelve\n",
      "hundred invisible guns, drew himself up in the face of death and as\n",
      "though he were more powerful than it, the whole barricade assumed amid\n",
      "the darkness, a supernatural and colossal form.\n",
      "\n",
      "There ensued one of those silences which occur only in the presence of\n",
      "prodigies. In the midst of this silence, the old man waved the red flag\n",
      "and shouted:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Long live the Revolution! Long live the Republic! Fraternity!\n",
      "Equality! and Death!”\n",

      "commissary of police who was making the legal summons at the other end\n",
      "of the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the same piercing voice which had shouted: “Who goes there?”\n",

      "fell backwards on the pavement, like a log, at full length, with\n",
      "outstretched arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rivulets of blood flowed beneath him. His aged head, pale and sad,\n",

      "\n",
      "One of those emotions which are superior to man, which make him forget\n",

      "\n",
      "“What men these regicides were!” said Enjolras.\n",

      "\n",
      "“This is for yourself alone, I do not wish to dampen the enthusiasm.\n",

      "was Father Mabeuf. I do not know what was the matter with him to-day.\n",
      "But he was a brave blockhead. Just look at his head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The head of a blockhead and the heart of a Brutus,” replied Enjolras.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he raised his voice:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Citizens! This is the example which the old give to the young. We\n",
      "hesitated, he came! We were drawing back, he advanced! This is what\n",
      "those who are trembling with age teach to those who tremble with fear!\n",
      "This aged man is august in the eyes of his country. He has had a long\n",
      "life and a magnificent death! Now, let us place the body under cover,\n",
      "that each one of us may defend this old man dead as he would his father\n",
      "living, and may his presence in our midst render the barricade\n",
      "impregnable!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A murmur of gloomy and energetic assent followed these words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjolras bent down, raised the old man’s head, and fierce as he was, he\n",
      "kissed him on the brow, then, throwing wide his arms, and handling this\n",
      "dead man with tender precaution, as though he feared to hurt it, he\n",
      "removed his coat, showed the bloody holes in it to all, and said:—\n",

      "time ago. You gave me a hundred sous, and I said to you: ‘I don’t want\n",
      "your money.’ I hope you picked up your coin? You are not rich. I did\n",

      "cherished a double idea, to defeat the projects of her father and the\n",
      "ruffians on the house of the Rue Plumet, and to separate Marius and\n",
      "Cosette. She had exchanged rags with the first young scamp she came\n",
      "across who had thought it amusing to dress like a woman, while Éponine\n",
      "disguised herself like a man. It was she who had conveyed to Jean\n",
      "Valjean in the Champ de Mars the expressive warning: “Leave your\n",
      "house.” Jean Valjean had, in fact, returned home, and had said to\n",
      "Cosette: “We set out this evening and we go to the Rue de l’Homme Armé\n",
      "with Toussaint. Next week, we shall be in London.” Cosette, utterly\n",
      "overwhelmed by this unexpected blow, had hastily penned a couple of\n",
      "lines to Marius. But how was she to get the letter to the post? She\n",
      "never went out alone, and Toussaint, surprised at such a commission,\n",
      "would certainly show the letter to M. Fauchelevent. In this dilemma,\n",
      "Cosette had caught sight through the fence of Éponine in man’s clothes,\n",
      "who now prowled incessantly around the garden. Cosette had called to\n",
      "“this young workman” and had handed him five francs and the letter,\n",
      "saying: “Carry this letter immediately to its address.” Éponine had put\n",
      "the letter in her pocket. The next day, on the 5th of June, she went to\n",
      "Courfeyrac’s quarters to inquire for Marius, not for the purpose of\n",
      "delivering the letter, but,—a thing which every jealous and loving soul\n",
      "will comprehend,—“to see.” There she had waited for Marius, or at least\n",
      "for Courfeyrac, still for the purpose of _seeing_. When Courfeyrac had\n",
      "told her: “We are going to the barricades,” an idea flashed through her\n",
      "mind, to fling herself into that death, as she would have done into any\n",
      "other, and to thrust Marius into it also. She had followed Courfeyrac,\n",
      "had made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process of\n",
      "construction; and, quite certain, since Marius had received no warning,\n",
      "and since she had intercepted the letter, that he would go at dusk to\n",
      "his trysting place for every evening, she had betaken herself to the\n",
      "Rue Plumet, had there awaited Marius, and had sent him, in the name of\n",
      "his friends, the appeal which would, she thought, lead him to the\n",
      "barricade. She reckoned on Marius’ despair when he should fail to find\n",
      "Cosette; she was not mistaken. She had returned to the Rue de la\n",
      "Chanvrerie herself. What she did there the reader has just seen. She\n",

      "Marius covered Cosette’s letter with kisses. So she loved him! For one\n",

      "England, and my grandfather refuses his consent to the marriage.\n",
      "Nothing is changed in our fates.” Dreamers like Marius are subject to\n",
      "supreme attacks of dejection, and desperate resolves are the result.\n",
      "The fatigue of living is insupportable; death is sooner over with. Then\n",
      "he reflected that he had still two duties to fulfil: to inform Cosette\n",
      "of his death and send her a final farewell, and to save from the\n",
      "impending catastrophe which was in preparation, that poor child,\n",
      "Éponine’s brother and Thénardier’s son.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Our marriage was impossible. I asked my grandfather, he refused; I\n",
      "have no fortune, neither hast thou. I hastened to thee, thou wert no\n",
      "longer there. Thou knowest the promise that I gave thee, I shall keep\n",
      "it. I die. I love thee. When thou readest this, my soul will be near\n",
      "thee, and thou wilt smile.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Having nothing wherewith to seal this letter, he contented himself with\n",
      "folding the paper in four, and added the address:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“To Mademoiselle Cosette Fauchelevent, at M. Fauchelevent’s, Rue de\n",
      "l’Homme Armé, No. 7.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Having folded the letter, he stood in thought for a moment, drew out\n",
      "his pocket-book again, opened it, and wrote, with the same pencil,\n",
      "these four lines on the first page:—\n",

      "done in his previous absences. He perceived the possibility of not\n",

      "behind nor confide his secret to her. Besides, he felt that she was\n",

      "It was with difficulty that Toussaint had obtained permission to pack\n",

      "Jean Valjean, with a view to augmenting the solitude and the mystery of\n",

      "which is so narrow that it is barred against carriages by a transverse\n",
      "beam placed on two posts, which is deaf and dumb in the midst of the\n",
      "clamorous city, dimly lighted at midday, and is, so to speak, incapable\n",
      "of emotions between two rows of lofty houses centuries old, which hold\n",
      "their peace like ancients as they are. There was a touch of stagnant\n",

      "He slept well. Night brings wisdom; we may add, night soothes. On the\n",
      "following morning he awoke in a mood that was almost gay. He thought\n",
      "the dining-room charming, though it was hideous, furnished with an old\n",
      "round table, a long sideboard surmounted by a slanting mirror, a\n",
      "dilapidated armchair, and several plain chairs which were encumbered\n",
      "with Toussaint’s packages. In one of these packages Jean Valjean’s\n",
      "uniform of a National Guard was visible through a rent.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Cosette, she had had Toussaint take some broth to her room, and\n",
      "did not make her appearance until evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "About five o’clock, Toussaint, who was going and coming and busying\n",
      "herself with the tiny establishment, set on the table a cold chicken,\n",
      "which Cosette, out of deference to her father, consented to glance at.\n",
      "\n",
      "That done, Cosette, under the pretext of an obstinate sick headache,\n",
      "had bade Jean Valjean good night and had shut herself up in her\n",
      "chamber. Jean Valjean had eaten a wing of the chicken with a good\n",
      "appetite, and with his elbows on the table, having gradually recovered\n",
      "his serenity, had regained possession of his sense of security.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was discussing this modest dinner, he had, twice or thrice,\n",
      "noticed in a confused way, Toussaint’s stammering words as she said to\n",
      "him: “Monsieur, there is something going on, they are fighting in\n",
      "Paris.” But absorbed in a throng of inward calculations, he had paid no\n",
      "heed to it. To tell the truth, he had not heard her. He rose and began\n",
      "to pace from the door to the window and from the window to the door,\n",
      "growing ever more serene.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this calm, Cosette, his sole anxiety, recurred to his thoughts.\n",
      "Not that he was troubled by this headache, a little nervous crisis, a\n",
      "young girl’s fit of sulks, the cloud of a moment, there would be\n",
      "nothing left of it in a day or two; but he meditated on the future,\n",
      "and, as was his habit, he thought of it with pleasure. After all, he\n",
      "saw no obstacle to their happy life resuming its course. At certain\n",
      "hours, everything seems impossible, at others everything appears easy;\n",
      "Jean Valjean was in the midst of one of these good hours. They\n",
      "generally succeed the bad ones, as day follows night, by virtue of that\n",
      "law of succession and of contrast which lies at the very foundation of\n",
      "nature, and which superficial minds call antithesis. In this peaceful\n",
      "street where he had taken refuge, Jean Valjean got rid of all that had\n",
      "been troubling him for some time past. This very fact, that he had seen\n",
      "many shadows, made him begin to perceive a little azure. To have\n",
      "quitted the Rue Plumet without complications or incidents was one good\n",
      "step already accomplished. Perhaps it would be wise to go abroad, if\n",
      "only for a few months, and to set out for London. Well, they would go.\n",
      "What difference did it make to him whether he was in France or in\n",
      "England, provided he had Cosette beside him? Cosette was his nation.\n",
      "Cosette sufficed for his happiness; the idea that he, perhaps, did not\n",
      "suffice for Cosette’s happiness, that idea which had formerly been the\n",
      "cause of his fever and sleeplessness, did not even present itself to\n",
      "his mind. He was in a state of collapse from all his past sufferings,\n",
      "and he was fully entered on optimism. Cosette was by his side, she\n",
      "seemed to be his; an optical illusion which every one has experienced.\n",
      "He arranged in his own mind, with all sorts of felicitous devices, his\n",
      "departure for England with Cosette, and he beheld his felicity\n",
      "reconstituted wherever he pleased, in the perspective of his reverie.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he paced to and fro with long strides, his glance suddenly\n",
      "encountered something strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard, he\n",
      "saw the four lines which follow:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out immediately. We\n",
      "shall be this evening in the Rue de l’Homme Armé, No. 7. In a week we\n",
      "shall be in England. COSETTE. June 4th.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean halted, perfectly haggard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette on her arrival had placed her blotting-book on the sideboard in\n",
      "front of the mirror, and, utterly absorbed in her agony of grief, had\n",
      "forgotten it and left it there, without even observing that she had\n",
      "left it wide open, and open at precisely the page on which she had laid\n",
      "to dry the four lines which she had penned, and which she had given in\n",
      "charge of the young workman in the Rue Plumet. The writing had been\n",
      "printed off on the blotter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mirror reflected the writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result was, what is called in geometry, _the symmetrical image_; so\n",
      "that the writing, reversed on the blotter, was righted in the mirror\n",
      "and presented its natural appearance; and Jean Valjean had beneath his\n",
      "eyes the letter written by Cosette to Marius on the preceding evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was simple and withering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean stepped up to the mirror. He read the four lines again,\n",
      "but he did not believe them. They produced on him the effect of\n",
      "appearing in a flash of lightning. It was a hallucination, it was\n",
      "impossible. It was not so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little by little, his perceptions became more precise; he looked at\n",
      "Cosette’s blotting-book, and the consciousness of the reality returned\n",
      "to him. He caught up the blotter and said: “It comes from there.” He\n",
      "feverishly examined the four lines imprinted on the blotter, the\n",
      "reversal of the letters converted into an odd scrawl, and he saw no\n",
      "sense in it. Then he said to himself: “But this signifies nothing;\n",
      "there is nothing written here.” And he drew a long breath with\n",
      "inexpressible relief. Who has not experienced those foolish joys in\n",
      "horrible instants? The soul does not surrender to despair until it has\n",
      "exhausted all illusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "He held the blotter in his hand and contemplated it in stupid delight,\n",
      "almost ready to laugh at the hallucination of which he had been the\n",
      "dupe. All at once his eyes fell upon the mirror again, and again he\n",
      "beheld the vision. There were the four lines outlined with inexorable\n",
      "clearness. This time it was no mirage. The recurrence of a vision is a\n",
      "reality; it was palpable, it was the writing restored in the mirror. He\n",
      "understood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean tottered, dropped the blotter, and fell into the old\n",
      "armchair beside the buffet, with drooping head, and glassy eyes, in\n",
      "utter bewilderment. He told himself that it was plain, that the light\n",
      "of the world had been eclipsed forever, and that Cosette had written\n",
      "that to some one. Then he heard his soul, which had become terrible\n",
      "once more, give vent to a dull roar in the gloom. Try then the effect\n",
      "of taking from the lion the dog which he has in his cage!\n",
      "\n",
      "Strange and sad to say, at that very moment, Marius had not yet\n",
      "received Cosette’s letter; chance had treacherously carried it to Jean\n",
      "Valjean before delivering it to Marius. Up to that day, Jean Valjean\n",
      "had not been vanquished by trial. He had been subjected to fearful\n",
      "proofs; no violence of bad fortune had been spared him; the ferocity of\n",
      "fate, armed with all vindictiveness and all social scorn, had taken him\n",
      "for her prey and had raged against him. He had accepted every extremity\n",
      "when it had been necessary; he had sacrificed his inviolability as a\n",
      "reformed man, had yielded up his liberty, risked his head, lost\n",
      "everything, suffered everything, and he had remained disinterested and\n",
      "stoical to such a point that he might have been thought to be absent\n",
      "from himself like a martyr. His conscience inured to every assault of\n",
      "destiny, might have appeared to be forever impregnable. Well, any one\n",
      "who had beheld his spiritual self would have been obliged to concede\n",
      "that it weakened at that moment. It was because, of all the tortures\n",
      "which he had undergone in the course of this long inquisition to which\n",
      "destiny had doomed him, this was the most terrible. Never had such\n",
      "pincers seized him hitherto. He felt the mysterious stirring of all his\n",
      "latent sensibilities. He felt the plucking at the strange chord. Alas!\n",
      "the supreme trial, let us say rather, the only trial, is the loss of\n",
      "the beloved being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor old Jean Valjean certainly did not love Cosette otherwise than as\n",
      "a father; but we have already remarked, above, that into this paternity\n",
      "the widowhood of his life had introduced all the shades of love; he\n",
      "loved Cosette as his daughter, and he loved her as his mother, and he\n",
      "loved her as his sister; and, as he had never had either a woman to\n",
      "love or a wife, as nature is a creditor who accepts no protest, that\n",
      "sentiment also, the most impossible to lose, was mingled with the rest,\n",
      "vague, ignorant, pure with the purity of blindness, unconscious,\n",
      "celestial, angelic, divine; less like a sentiment than like an\n",
      "instinct, less like an instinct than like an imperceptible and\n",
      "invisible but real attraction; and love, properly speaking, was, in his\n",
      "immense tenderness for Cosette, like the thread of gold in the\n",
      "mountain, concealed and virgin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have already\n",
      "indicated. No marriage was possible between them; not even that of\n",
      "souls; and yet, it is certain that their destinies were wedded. With\n",
      "the exception of Cosette, that is to say, with the exception of a\n",
      "childhood, Jean Valjean had never, in the whole of his long life, known\n",
      "anything of that which may be loved. The passions and loves which\n",
      "succeed each other had not produced in him those successive green\n",
      "growths, tender green or dark green, which can be seen in foliage which\n",
      "passes through the winter and in men who pass fifty. In short, and we\n",
      "have insisted on it more than once, all this interior fusion, all this\n",
      "whole, of which the sum total was a lofty virtue, ended in rendering\n",
      "Jean Valjean a father to Cosette. A strange father, forged from the\n",
      "grandfather, the son, the brother, and the husband, that existed in\n",
      "Jean Valjean; a father in whom there was included even a mother; a\n",
      "father who loved Cosette and adored her, and who held that child as his\n",
      "light, his home, his family, his country, his paradise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus when he saw that the end had absolutely come, that she was\n",
      "escaping from him, that she was slipping from his hands, that she was\n",
      "gliding from him, like a cloud, like water, when he had before his eyes\n",
      "this crushing proof: “another is the goal of her heart, another is the\n",
      "wish of her life; there is a dearest one, I am no longer anything but\n",
      "her father, I no longer exist”; when he could no longer doubt, when he\n",
      "said to himself: “She is going away from me!” the grief which he felt\n",
      "surpassed the bounds of possibility. To have done all that he had done\n",
      "for the purpose of ending like this! And the very idea of being\n",
      "nothing! Then, as we have just said, a quiver of revolt ran through him\n",
      "from head to foot. He felt, even in the very roots of his hair, the\n",
      "immense reawakening of egotism, and the _I_ in this man’s abyss howled.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is such a thing as the sudden giving way of the inward subsoil. A\n",
      "despairing certainty does not make its way into a man without thrusting\n",
      "aside and breaking certain profound elements which, in some cases, are\n",
      "the very man himself. Grief, when it attains this shape, is a headlong\n",
      "flight of all the forces of the conscience. These are fatal crises. Few\n",
      "among us emerge from them still like ourselves and firm in duty. When\n",
      "the limit of endurance is overstepped, the most imperturbable virtue is\n",
      "disconcerted. Jean Valjean took the blotter again, and convinced\n",
      "himself afresh; he remained bowed and as though petrified and with\n",
      "staring eyes, over those four unobjectionable lines; and there arose\n",
      "within him such a cloud that one might have thought that everything in\n",
      "this soul was crumbling away.\n",
      "\n",
      "He examined this revelation, athwart the exaggerations of reverie, with\n",
      "an apparent and terrifying calmness, for it is a fearful thing when a\n",
      "man’s calmness reaches the coldness of the statue.\n",
      "\n",
      "He measured the terrible step which his destiny had taken without his\n",
      "having a suspicion of the fact; he recalled his fears of the preceding\n",
      "summer, so foolishly dissipated; he recognized the precipice, it was\n",
      "still the same; only, Jean Valjean was no longer on the brink, he was\n",
      "at the bottom of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unprecedented and heart-rending thing about it was that he had\n",
      "fallen without perceiving it. All the light of his life had departed,\n",
      "while he still fancied that he beheld the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "His instinct did not hesitate. He put together certain circumstances,\n",
      "certain dates, certain blushes and certain pallors on Cosette’s part,\n",
      "and he said to himself: “It is he.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The divination of despair is a sort of mysterious bow which never\n",
      "misses its aim. He struck Marius with his first conjecture. He did not\n",
      "know the name, but he found the man instantly. He distinctly perceived,\n",
      "in the background of the implacable conjuration of his memories, the\n",
      "unknown prowler of the Luxembourg, that wretched seeker of love\n",
      "adventures, that idler of romance, that idiot, that coward, for it is\n",
      "cowardly to come and make eyes at young girls who have beside them a\n",
      "father who loves them.\n",
      "\n",
      "After he had thoroughly verified the fact that this young man was at\n",
      "the bottom of this situation, and that everything proceeded from that\n",
      "quarter, he, Jean Valjean, the regenerated man, the man who had so\n",
      "labored over his soul, the man who had made so many efforts to resolve\n",
      "all life, all misery, and all unhappiness into love, looked into his\n",
      "own breast and there beheld a spectre, Hate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great griefs contain something of dejection. They discourage one with\n",
      "existence. The man into whom they enter feels something within him\n",
      "withdraw from him. In his youth, their visits are lugubrious; later on\n",
      "they are sinister. Alas, if despair is a fearful thing when the blood\n",
      "is hot, when the hair is black, when the head is erect on the body like\n",
      "the flame on the torch, when the roll of destiny still retains its full\n",
      "thickness, when the heart, full of desirable love, still possesses\n",
      "beats which can be returned to it, when one has time for redress, when\n",
      "all women and all smiles and all the future and all the horizon are\n",
      "before one, when the force of life is complete, what is it in old age,\n",
      "when the years hasten on, growing ever paler, to that twilight hour\n",
      "when one begins to behold the stars of the tomb?\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was meditating, Toussaint entered. Jean Valjean rose and asked\n",
      "her:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“In what quarter is it? Do you know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Toussaint was struck dumb, and could only answer him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean began again: “Did you not tell me that just now that there\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! yes, sir,” replied Toussaint. “It is in the direction of\n",

      "There is a mechanical movement which comes to us, unconsciously, from\n",
      "the most profound depths of our thought. It was, no doubt, under the\n",
      "impulse of a movement of this sort, and of which he was hardly\n",
      "conscious, that Jean Valjean, five minutes later, found himself in the\n",
      "street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bareheaded, he sat upon the stone post at the door of his house. He\n",

      "CHAPTER II—THE STREET URCHIN AN ENEMY OF LIGHT\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How long did he remain thus? What was the ebb and flow of this tragic\n",
      "meditation? Did he straighten up? Did he remain bowed? Had he been bent\n",
      "to breaking? Could he still rise and regain his footing in his\n",
      "conscience upon something solid? He probably would not have been able\n",
      "to tell himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The street was deserted. A few uneasy bourgeois, who were rapidly\n",
      "returning home, hardly saw him. Each one for himself in times of peril.\n",
      "The lamp-lighter came as usual to light the lantern which was situated\n",
      "precisely opposite the door of No. 7, and then went away. Jean Valjean\n",
      "would not have appeared like a living man to any one who had examined\n",
      "him in that shadow. He sat there on the post of his door, motionless as\n",
      "a form of ice. There is congealment in despair. The alarm bells and a\n",
      "vague and stormy uproar were audible. In the midst of all these\n",
      "convulsions of the bell mingled with the revolt, the clock of\n",
      "Saint-Paul struck eleven, gravely and without haste; for the tocsin is\n",
      "man; the hour is God. The passage of the hour produced no effect on\n",
      "Jean Valjean; Jean Valjean did not stir. Still, at about that moment, a\n",
      "brusque report burst forth in the direction of the Halles, a second yet\n",
      "more violent followed; it was probably that attack on the barricade in\n",
      "the Rue de la Chanvrerie which we have just seen repulsed by Marius. At\n",
      "this double discharge, whose fury seemed augmented by the stupor of the\n",
      "night, Jean Valjean started; he rose, turning towards the quarter\n",
      "whence the noise proceeded; then he fell back upon the post again,\n",
      "folded his arms, and his head slowly sank on his bosom again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He resumed his gloomy dialogue with himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once, he raised his eyes; some one was walking in the street, he\n",
      "heard steps near him. He looked, and by the light of the lanterns, in\n",
      "the direction of the street which ran into the Rue-aux-Archives, he\n",
      "perceived a young, livid, and beaming face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche had just arrived in the Rue de l’Homme Armé.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche was staring into the air, apparently in search of something.\n",
      "He saw Jean Valjean perfectly well but he took no notice of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche after staring into the air, stared below; he raised himself on\n",
      "tiptoe, and felt of the doors and windows of the ground floor; they\n",
      "were all shut, bolted, and padlocked. After having authenticated the\n",
      "fronts of five or six barricaded houses in this manner, the urchin\n",
      "shrugged his shoulders, and took himself to task in these terms:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardi!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he began to stare into the air again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean, who, an instant previously, in his then state of mind,\n",
      "would not have spoken to or even answered any one, felt irresistibly\n",
      "impelled to accost that child.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter with you, my little fellow?” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The matter with me is that I am hungry,” replied Gavroche frankly. And\n",
      "he added: “Little fellow yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean fumbled in his fob and pulled out a five-franc piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Gavroche, who was of the wagtail species, and who skipped\n",
      "vivaciously from one gesture to another, had just picked up a stone. He\n",
      "had caught sight of the lantern.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See here,” said he, “you still have your lanterns here. You are\n",
      "disobeying the regulations, my friend. This is disorderly. Smash that\n",
      "for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he flung the stone at the lantern, whose broken glass fell with\n",
      "such a clatter that the bourgeois in hiding behind their curtains in\n",
      "the opposite house cried: “There is ‘Ninety-three’ come again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The lantern oscillated violently, and went out. The street had suddenly\n",
      "become black.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s right, old street,” ejaculated Gavroche, “put on your\n",
      "night-cap.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And turning to Jean Valjean:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you call that gigantic monument that you have there at the end\n",
      "of the street? It’s the Archives, isn’t it? I must crumble up those big\n",
      "stupids of pillars a bit and make a nice barricade out of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Valjean stepped up to Gavroche.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor creature,” he said in a low tone, and speaking to himself, “he is\n",

      "Gavroche raised his face, astonished at the size of this sou; he stared\n",
      "at it in the darkness, and the whiteness of the big sou dazzled him. He\n",
      "knew five-franc pieces by hearsay; their reputation was agreeable to\n",
      "him; he was delighted to see one close to. He said:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us contemplate the tiger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He gazed at it for several minutes in ecstasy; then, turning to Jean\n",
      "Valjean, he held out the coin to him, and said majestically to him:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bourgeois, I prefer to smash lanterns. Take back your ferocious beast.\n",

      "“More than you have, perhaps.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” returned Jean Valjean, “keep the money for your mother!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche was touched. Moreover, he had just noticed that the man who\n",
      "was addressing him had no hat, and this inspired him with confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Truly,” said he, “so it wasn’t to keep me from breaking the lanterns?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Break whatever you please.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "His confidence having increased, he added:—\n",

      "“Do you belong in this street?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“What do you want with No. 7?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the child paused, he feared that he had said too much; he thrust\n",
      "his nails energetically into his hair and contented himself with\n",
      "replying:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! Here it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "An idea flashed through Jean Valjean’s mind. Anguish does have these\n",

      "“Are you the person who is bringing a letter that I am expecting?”\n",
      "\n",

      "“The letter is for Mademoiselle Cosette, is it not?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” resumed Jean Valjean, “I am the person to whom you are to\n",

      "“In that case, you must know that I was sent from the barricade.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Of course,” said Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavroche engulfed his hand in another of his pockets and drew out a\n",
      "paper folded in four.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he made the military salute.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Respect for despatches,” said he. “It comes from the Provisional\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give it to me,” said Jean Valjean.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Don’t go and fancy it’s a love letter. It is for a woman, but it’s for\n",
      "the people. We men fight and we respect the fair sex. We are not as\n",
      "they are in fine society, where there are lions who send chickens55 to\n",

      "made a hole in it, with the rigid rapidity of a projectile; the alley\n",
      "of l’Homme Armé became silent and solitary once more; in a twinkling,\n",
      "that strange child, who had about him something of the shadow and of\n",
      "the dream, had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses,\n",
      "and was lost there, like smoke in the dark; and one might have thought\n",
      "that he had dissipated and vanished, had there not taken place, a few\n",
      "minutes after his disappearance, a startling shiver of glass, and had\n",
      "not the magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement\n",

      "and he, Jean Valjean, had had no hand in the matter, and it was through\n",
      "no fault of his. Perhaps, even, he is already dead. Here his fever\n",
      "entered into calculations. No, he is not dead yet. The letter had\n",
      "evidently been intended for Cosette to read on the following morning;\n",
      "after the two discharges that were heard between eleven o’clock and\n",

      "about to find himself alone with Cosette once more. The rivalry would\n",
      "cease; the future was beginning again. He had but to keep this note in\n",
      "his pocket. Cosette would never know what had become of that man. All\n",
      "that there requires to be done is to let things take their own course.\n",

      "faubourg, it reared itself like a cyclopean dike at the end of the\n",
      "formidable place which had seen the 14th of July. Nineteen barricades\n",
      "were ranged, one behind the other, in the depths of the streets behind\n",

      "agonizing suffering in the immense faubourg, which had reached that\n",

      "was that barricade made? Of the ruins of three six-story houses\n",
      "demolished expressly, said some. Of the prodigy of all wraths, said\n",
      "others. It wore the lamentable aspect of all constructions of hatred,\n",
      "ruin. It might be asked: Who built this? It might also be said: Who\n",

      "broken brazier! this cracked pot! Give all! cast away all! Push this\n",

      "broken bowl,—threatening fraternization of every sort of rubbish.\n",
      "Sisyphus had thrown his rock there and Job his potsherd. Terrible, in\n",
      "short. It was the acropolis of the barefooted. Overturned carts broke\n",
      "the uniformity of the slope; an immense dray was spread out there\n",
      "crossways, its axle pointing heavenward, and seemed a scar on that\n",
      "tumultuous façade; an omnibus hoisted gayly, by main force, to the very\n",
      "summit of the heap, as though the architects of this bit of savagery\n",
      "had wished to add a touch of the street urchin humor to their terror,\n",
      "presented its horseless, unharnessed pole to no one knows what horses\n",

      "the trouble and this barricade was worthy to figure on the very spot\n",
      "whence the Bastille had disappeared. If the ocean made dikes, it is\n",
      "thus that it would build. The fury of the flood was stamped upon this\n",
      "shapeless mass. What flood? The crowd. One thought one beheld hubbub\n",
      "petrified. One thought one heard humming above this barricade as though\n",
      "there had been over their hive, enormous, dark bees of violent\n",
      "progress. Was it a thicket? Was it a bacchanalia? Was it a fortress?\n",
      "Vertigo seemed to have constructed it with blows of its wings. There\n",
      "was something of the cesspool in that redoubt and something Olympian in\n",

      "window sashes with their glass planted there in the ruins awaiting the\n",
      "cannon, wrecks of chimneys, cupboards, tables, benches, howling\n",
      "topsyturveydom, and those thousand poverty-stricken things, the very\n",
      "refuse of the mendicant, which contain at the same time fury and\n",
      "nothingness. One would have said that it was the tatters of a people,\n",
      "rags of wood, of iron, of bronze, of stone, and that the Faubourg Saint\n",
      "Antoine had thrust it there at its door, with a colossal flourish of\n",
      "the broom making of its misery its barricade. Blocks resembling\n",
      "headsman’s blocks, dislocated chains, pieces of woodwork with brackets\n",
      "having the form of gibbets, horizontal wheels projecting from the\n",
      "rubbish, amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of\n",
      "the old tortures endured by the people. The barricade Saint Antoine\n",
      "converted everything into a weapon; everything that civil war could\n",
      "throw at the head of society proceeded thence; it was not combat, it\n",
      "was a paroxysm; the carbines which defended this redoubt, among which\n",
      "there were some blunderbusses, sent bits of earthenware bones,\n",
      "coat-buttons, even the casters from night-stands, dangerous projectiles\n",
      "on account of the brass. This barricade was furious; it hurled to the\n",
      "clouds an inexpressible clamor; at certain moments, when provoking the\n",
      "army, it was covered with throngs and tempest; a tumultuous crowd of\n",
      "flaming heads crowned it; a swarm filled it; it had a thorny crest of\n",
      "guns, of sabres, of cudgels, of axes, of pikes and of bayonets; a vast\n",
      "red flag flapped in the wind; shouts of command, songs of attack, the\n",
      "roll of drums, the sobs of women and bursts of gloomy laughter from the\n",
      "starving were to be heard there. It was huge and living, and, like the\n",
      "back of an electric beast, there proceeded from it little flashes of\n",
      "lightning. The spirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit\n",
      "where rumbled that voice of the people which resembles the voice of\n",
      "God; a strange majesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish.\n",
      "It was a heap of filth and it was Sinai.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we have said previously, it attacked in the name of the\n",

      "The faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance. The faubourg\n",
      "shouldered the redoubt, the redoubt took its stand under cover of the\n",

      "strategy of the African generals dashed itself. Its caverns, its\n",
      "excrescences, its warts, its gibbosities, grimaced, so to speak, and\n",
      "grinned beneath the smoke. The mitraille vanished in shapelessness; the\n",

      "what was the use of cannonading chaos? and the regiments, accustomed to\n",

      "a sort of hyphen between the houses on the right and the houses on the\n",
      "left, as though the street had folded back on itself its loftiest wall\n",
      "in order to close itself abruptly. This wall was built of\n",
      "paving-stones. It was straight, correct, cold, perpendicular, levelled\n",
      "with the square, laid out by rule and line. Cement was lacking, of\n",
      "course, but, as in the case of certain Roman walls, without interfering\n",
      "with its rigid architecture. The entablature was mathematically\n",
      "parallel with the base. From distance to distance, one could\n",
      "distinguish on the gray surface, almost invisible loopholes which\n",
      "resembled black threads. These loopholes were separated from each other\n",
      "by equal spaces. The street was deserted as far as the eye could reach.\n",
      "All windows and doors were closed. In the background rose this barrier,\n",
      "which made a blind thoroughfare of the street, a motionless and\n",
      "tranquil wall; no one was visible, nothing was audible; not a cry, not\n",
      "a sound, not a breath. A sepulchre.\n",

      "mysterious apparition. It was adjusted, jointed, imbricated,\n",
      "rectilinear, symmetrical and funereal. Science and gloom met there. One\n",
      "felt that the chief of this barricade was a geometrician or a spectre.\n",

      "From time to time, if some soldier, an officer or representative of the\n",
      "people, chanced to traverse the deserted highway, a faint, sharp\n",

      "escaped the bullet, sometimes a biscaïen was seen to ensconce itself in\n",
      "some closed shutter, in the interstice between two blocks of stone, or\n",
      "in the plaster of a wall. For the men in the barricade had made\n",
      "themselves two small cannons out of two cast-iron lengths of gas-pipe,\n",
      "plugged up at one end with tow and fire-clay. There was no waste of\n",
      "useless powder. Nearly every shot told. There were corpses here and\n",

      "came, moved about there like black forms. Above that terrible\n",
      "nesting-place of gloom the stories of the mute houses were lividly\n",

      "when Pope insults Shakspeare, when Frederic insults Voltaire, it is an\n",
      "old law of envy and hatred which is being carried out; genius attracts\n",
      "insult, great men are always more or less barked at. But Zoïlus and\n",
      "Cicero are two different persons. Cicero is an arbiter in thought, just\n",
      "as Brutus is an arbiter by the sword. For my own part, I blame that\n",

      "violator of the Rubicon, conferring, as though they came from him, the\n",
      "dignities which emanated from the people, not rising at the entrance of\n",
      "the senate, committed the acts of a king and almost of a tyrant, _regia\n",

      "the better; the lesson is but the more exalted. His twenty-three wounds\n",
      "touch me less than the spitting in the face of Jesus Christ. Cæsar is\n",

      "The insurgents, we will remark, were full of hope. The manner in which\n",
      "they had repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them to\n",
      "almost disdain in advance the attack at dawn. They waited for it with a\n",
      "smile. They had no more doubt as to their success than as to their\n",
      "cause. Moreover, succor was, evidently, on the way to them. They\n",
      "reckoned on it. With that facility of triumphant prophecy which is one\n",
      "of the sources of strength in the French combatant, they divided the\n",
      "day which was at hand into three distinct phases. At six o’clock in the\n",
      "morning a regiment “which had been labored with,” would turn; at noon,\n",
      "the insurrection of all Paris; at sunset, revolution.\n",

      "Enjolras reappeared. He returned from his sombre eagle flight into\n",
      "outer darkness. He listened for a moment to all this joy with folded\n",

      "whiteness of the dawn, he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The whole army of Paris is to strike. A third of the army is bearing\n",
      "down upon the barricades in which you now are. There is the National\n",
      "Guard in addition. I have picked out the shakos of the fifth of the\n",
      "line, and the standard-bearers of the sixth legion. In one hour you\n",
      "will be attacked. As for the populace, it was seething yesterday,\n",
      "to-day it is not stirring. There is nothing to expect; nothing to hope\n",
      "for. Neither from a faubourg nor from a regiment. You are abandoned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These words fell upon the buzzing of the groups, and produced on them\n",
      "the effect caused on a swarm of bees by the first drops of a storm. A\n",

      "“So be it. Let us raise the barricade to a height of twenty feet, and\n",
      "let us all remain in it. Citizens, let us offer the protests of\n",

      "republicans do not abandon the people.”\n",

      "don’t make others die. Suicides like that which is on the brink of\n",
      "accomplishment here are sublime; but suicide is narrow, and does not\n",
      "admit of extension; and as soon as it touches your neighbors, suicide\n",
      "is murder. Think of the little blond heads; think of the white locks.\n",
      "Listen, Enjolras has just told me that he saw at the corner of the Rue\n",
      "du Cygne a lighted casement, a candle in a poor window, on the fifth\n",
      "floor, and on the pane the quivering shadow of the head of an old\n",
      "woman, who had the air of having spent the night in watching. Perhaps\n",
      "she is the mother of some one of you. Well, let that man go, and make\n",
      "haste, to say to his mother: ‘Here I am, mother!’ Let him feel at ease,\n",

      "purity, who sing and prattle, who are like a living perfume, who prove\n",
      "the existence of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth,\n",
      "that Jeanne, that Lise, that Mimi, those adorable and honest creatures\n",
      "who are your blessings and your pride, ah! good God, they will suffer\n",

      "flesh; and it is not with your shadowy hands, shuddering around them,\n",
      "that you will prevent them from entering it! Think of the street, think\n",
      "of the pavement covered with passers-by, think of the shops past which\n",
      "women go and come with necks all bare, and through the mire. These\n",
      "women, too, were pure once. Think of your sisters, those of you who\n",
      "have them. Misery, prostitution, the police, Saint-Lazare—that is what\n",
      "those beautiful, delicate girls, those fragile marvels of modesty,\n",
      "gentleness and loveliness, fresher than lilacs in the month of May,\n",
      "will come to. Ah! you have got yourselves killed! You are no longer on\n",
      "hand! That is well; you have wished to release the people from Royalty,\n",
      "and you deliver over your daughters to the police. Friends, have a\n",
      "care, have mercy. Women, unhappy women, we are not in the habit of\n",

      "shake hands with us and take themselves off, and leave us here alone to\n",

      "‘I have a gun, I am at the barricade; so much the worse, I shall remain\n",
      "there.’ So much the worse is easily said. My friends, there is a\n",
      "morrow; you will not be here to-morrow, but your families will; and\n",

      "there was never any fire, and whose pipe, you know, was of mastic and\n",
      "yellow clay. His breathing was hoarse, his face livid, his limbs\n",
      "flaccid, his belly prominent. He said nothing. If you spoke to him, he\n",
      "did not answer. He is dead. He was taken to the Necker Hospital, where\n",

      "Enjolras bore within him the plenitude of the revolution; he was\n",

      "his mind, in the society of the Friends of the A B C, had ended by\n",
      "undergoing a certain polarization from Combeferre’s ideas; for some\n",
      "time past, he had been gradually emerging from the narrow form of\n",

      "immense human republic. As far as the immediate means were concerned, a\n",

      "erect on the staircase of paving-stones, one elbow resting on the stock\n",
      "of his gun. He was engaged in thought; he quivered, as at the passage\n",

      "flame, the griffin who was the monster of the air, and who flew with\n",
      "the wings of an eagle and the talons of a tiger; fearful beasts which\n",
      "were above man. Man, nevertheless, spread his snares, consecrated by\n",
      "intelligence, and finally conquered these monsters. We have vanquished\n",
      "the hydra, and it is called the locomotive; we are on the point of\n",
      "vanquishing the griffin, we already grasp it, and it is called the\n",

      "Courage, and onward! Citizens, whither are we going? To science made\n",
      "government, to the force of things become the sole public force, to the\n",
      "natural law, having in itself its sanction and its penalty and\n",
      "promulgating itself by evidence, to a dawn of truth corresponding to a\n",
      "dawn of day. We are advancing to the union of peoples; we are advancing\n",
      "to the unity of man. No more fictions; no more parasites. The real\n",
      "governed by the true, that is the goal. Civilization will hold its\n",
      "assizes at the summit of Europe, and, later on, at the centre of\n",
      "continents, in a grand parliament of the intelligence. Something\n",
      "similar has already been seen. The amphictyons had two sittings a year,\n",
      "one at Delphos the seat of the gods, the other at Thermopylæ, the place\n",
      "of heroes. Europe will have her amphictyons; the globe will have its\n",
      "amphictyons. France bears this sublime future in her breast. This is\n",
      "the gestation of the nineteenth century. That which Greece sketched out\n",
      "is worthy of being finished by France. Listen to me, you, Feuilly,\n",
      "valiant artisan, man of the people. I revere you. Yes, you clearly\n",
      "behold the future, yes, you are right. You had neither father nor\n",
      "mother, Feuilly; you adopted humanity for your mother and right for\n",
      "your father. You are about to die, that is to say to triumph, here.\n",
      "Citizens, whatever happens to-day, through our defeat as well as\n",
      "through our victory, it is a revolution that we are about to create. As\n",
      "conflagrations light up a whole city, so revolutions illuminate the\n",
      "whole human race. And what is the revolution that we shall cause? I\n",
      "have just told you, the Revolution of the True. From a political point\n",
      "of view, there is but a single principle; the sovereignty of man over\n",
      "himself. This sovereignty of myself over myself is called Liberty.\n",
      "Where two or three of these sovereignties are combined, the state\n",
      "begins. But in that association there is no abdication. Each\n",
      "sovereignty concedes a certain quantity of itself, for the purpose of\n",
      "forming the common right. This quantity is the same for all of us. This\n",
      "identity of concession which each makes to all, is called Equality.\n",
      "Common right is nothing else than the protection of all beaming on the\n",
      "right of each. This protection of all over each is called Fraternity.\n",
      "The point of intersection of all these assembled sovereignties is\n",
      "called society. This intersection being a junction, this point is a\n",
      "knot. Hence what is called the social bond. Some say social contract;\n",
      "which is the same thing, the word contract being etymologically formed\n",
      "with the idea of a bond. Let us come to an understanding about\n",
      "equality; for, if liberty is the summit, equality is the base.\n",
      "Equality, citizens, is not wholly a surface vegetation, a society of\n",
      "great blades of grass and tiny oaks; a proximity of jealousies which\n",
      "render each other null and void; legally speaking, it is all aptitudes\n",
      "possessed of the same opportunity; politically, it is all votes\n",
      "possessed of the same weight; religiously, it is all consciences\n",
      "possessed of the same right. Equality has an organ: gratuitous and\n",
      "obligatory instruction. The right to the alphabet, that is where the\n",
      "beginning must be made. The primary school imposed on all, the\n",
      "secondary school offered to all, that is the law. From an identical\n",
      "school, an identical society will spring. Yes, instruction! light!\n",
      "light! everything comes from light, and to it everything returns.\n",
      "Citizens, the nineteenth century is great, but the twentieth century\n",
      "will be happy. Then, there will be nothing more like the history of\n",
      "old, we shall no longer, as to-day, have to fear a conquest, an\n",
      "invasion, a usurpation, a rivalry of nations, arms in hand, an\n",
      "interruption of civilization depending on a marriage of kings, on a\n",
      "birth in hereditary tyrannies, a partition of peoples by a congress, a\n",
      "dismemberment because of the failure of a dynasty, a combat of two\n",
      "religions meeting face to face, like two bucks in the dark, on the\n",
      "bridge of the infinite; we shall no longer have to fear famine, farming\n",
      "out, prostitution arising from distress, misery from the failure of\n",
      "work and the scaffold and the sword, and battles and the ruffianism of\n",
      "chance in the forest of events. One might almost say: There will be no\n",
      "more events. We shall be happy. The human race will accomplish its law,\n",
      "as the terrestrial globe accomplishes its law; harmony will be\n",
      "re-established between the soul and the star; the soul will gravitate\n",
      "around the truth, as the planet around the light. Friends, the present\n",
      "hour in which I am addressing you, is a gloomy hour; but these are\n",
      "terrible purchases of the future. A revolution is a toll. Oh! the human\n",
      "race will be delivered, raised up, consoled! We affirm it on this\n",
      "barrier. Whence should proceed that cry of love, if not from the\n",
      "heights of sacrifice? Oh my brothers, this is the point of junction, of\n",
      "those who think and of those who suffer; this barricade is not made of\n",
      "paving-stones, nor of joists, nor of bits of iron; it is made of two\n",
      "heaps, a heap of ideas, and a heap of woes. Here misery meets the\n",
      "ideal. The day embraces the night, and says to it: ‘I am about to die,\n",
      "and thou shalt be born again with me.’ From the embrace of all\n",
      "desolations faith leaps forth. Sufferings bring hither their agony and\n",
      "ideas their immortality. This agony and this immortality are about to\n",
      "join and constitute our death. Brothers, he who dies here dies in the\n",

      "had entered the tomb, it seemed to him that he was already on the other\n",
      "side of the wall, and he no longer beheld the faces of the living\n",
      "except with the eyes of one dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "How did M. Fauchelevent come there? Why was he there? What had he come\n",

      "Besides, since our despair has this peculiarity, that it envelops\n",
      "others as well as ourselves, it seemed logical to him that all the\n",

      "Nothing is more curious than a barricade preparing for an assault. Each\n",

      "just finished rolling it slowly, correctly, without haste, into\n",

      "the captain of the piece, bearing down upon the breech in order to\n",

      "to render it possible to force the charge, it may become necessary to\n",

      "trajectory is not as rigid as could be desired, the parabola is\n",
      "exaggerated, the line of the projectile is no longer sufficiently\n",
      "rectilinear to allow of its striking intervening objects, which is,\n",
      "nevertheless, a necessity of battle, the importance of which increases\n",
      "with the proximity of the enemy and the precipitation of the discharge.\n",
      "This defect of the tension of the curve of the projectile in the rifled\n",
      "cannon of the sixteenth century arose from the smallness of the charge;\n",
      "small charges for that sort of engine are imposed by the ballistic\n",
      "necessities, such, for instance, as the preservation of the\n",
      "gun-carriage. In short, that despot, the cannon, cannot do all that it\n",
      "desires; force is a great weakness. A cannon-ball only travels six\n",

      "\n",
      "At that moment, Cosette awoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her chamber was narrow, neat, unobtrusive, with a long sash-window,\n",
      "facing the East on the back court-yard of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette knew nothing of what was going on in Paris. She had not been\n",
      "there on the preceding evening, and she had already retired to her\n",
      "chamber when Toussaint had said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“It appears that there is a row.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosette had slept only a few hours, but soundly. She had had sweet\n",
      "dreams, which possibly arose from the fact that her little bed was very\n",
      "white. Some one, who was Marius, had appeared to her in the light. She\n",
      "awoke with the sun in her eyes, which, at first, produced on her the\n",
      "effect of being a continuation of her dream. Her first thought on\n",
      "emerging from this dream was a smiling one. Cosette felt herself\n",
      "thoroughly reassured. Like Jean Valjean, she had, a few hours\n",
      "previously, passed through that reaction of the soul which absolutely\n",
      "will not hear of unhappiness. She began to cherish hope, with all her\n",
      "might, without knowing why. Then she felt a pang at her heart. It was\n",
      "three days since she had seen Marius. But she said to herself that he\n",
      "must have received her letter, that he knew where she was, and that he\n",
      "was so clever that he would find means of reaching her.—And that\n",
      "certainly to-day, and perhaps that very morning.—It was broad daylight,\n",
      "but the rays of light were very horizontal; she thought that it was\n",
      "very early, but that she must rise, nevertheless, in order to receive\n",
      "Marius.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt that she could not live without Marius, and that,\n",
      "consequently, that was sufficient and that Marius would come. No\n",
      "objection was valid. All this was certain. It was monstrous enough\n",
      "already to have suffered for three days. Marius absent three days, this\n",
      "was horrible on the part of the good God. Now, this cruel teasing from\n",
      "on high had been gone through with. Marius was about to arrive, and he\n",
      "would bring good news. Youth is made thus; it quickly dries its eyes;\n",
      "it finds sorrow useless and does not accept it. Youth is the smile of\n",
      "the future in the presence of an unknown quantity, which is itself. It\n",
      "is natural to it to be happy. It seems as though its respiration were\n",
      "made of hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Cosette could not remember what Marius had said to her on the\n",
      "subject of this absence which was to last only one day, and what\n",
      "explanation of it he had given her. Every one has noticed with what\n",
      "nimbleness a coin which one has dropped on the ground rolls away and\n",
      "hides, and with what art it renders itself undiscoverable. There are\n",
      "thoughts which play us the same trick; they nestle away in a corner of\n",
      "our brain; that is the end of them; they are lost; it is impossible to\n",
      "lay the memory on them. Cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless\n",
      "little effort made by her memory. She told herself, that it was very\n",
      "naughty and very wicked of her, to have forgotten the words uttered by\n",
      "Marius.\n",

      "She sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of soul and\n",

      "drawn, those tremors, those shivers of cold and modesty, that exquisite\n",

      "is no cause for alarm, the successive phases of dressing, as charming\n",

      "down on the peach, the bloom on the plum, the radiated crystal of the\n",

      "The young girl is only the flash of a dream, and is not yet a statue.\n",
      "Her bed-chamber is hidden in the sombre part of the ideal. The\n",

      "which was a very simple matter in those days, when women did not swell\n",
      "out their curls and bands with cushions and puffs, and did not put\n",
      "crinoline in their locks. Then she opened the window and cast her eyes\n",
      "around her in every direction, hoping to descry some bit of the street,\n",
      "an angle of the house, an edge of pavement, so that she might be able\n",
      "to watch for Marius there. But no view of the outside was to be had.\n",
      "The back court was surrounded by tolerably high walls, and the outlook\n",
      "was only on several gardens. Cosette pronounced these gardens hideous:\n",
      "for the first time in her life, she found flowers ugly. The smallest\n",
      "scrap of the gutter of the street would have met her wishes better. She\n",
      "decided to gaze at the sky, as though she thought that Marius might\n",
      "come from that quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once, she burst into tears. Not that this was fickleness of\n",
      "soul; but hopes cut in twain by dejection—that was her case. She had a\n",
      "confused consciousness of something horrible. Thoughts were rife in the\n",
      "air, in fact. She told herself that she was not sure of anything, that\n",
      "to withdraw herself from sight was to be lost; and the idea that Marius\n",
      "could return to her from heaven appeared to her no longer charming but\n",
      "mournful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, as is the nature of these clouds, calm returned to her, and hope\n",
      "and a sort of unconscious smile, which yet indicated trust in God.\n",

      "Every one in the house was still asleep. A country-like silence\n",
      "reigned. Not a shutter had been opened. The porter’s lodge was closed.\n",
      "Toussaint had not risen, and Cosette, naturally, thought that her\n",
      "father was asleep. She must have suffered much, and she must have still\n",
      "been suffering greatly, for she said to herself, that her father had\n",
      "been unkind; but she counted on Marius. The eclipse of such a light was\n",
      "decidedly impossible. Now and then, she heard sharp shocks in the\n",
      "distance, and she said: “It is odd that people should be opening and\n",
      "shutting their carriage gates so early.” They were the reports of the\n",

      "A few feet below Cosette’s window, in the ancient and perfectly black\n",
      "cornice of the wall, there was a martin’s nest; the curve of this nest\n",
      "formed a little projection beyond the cornice, so that from above it\n",
      "was possible to look into this little paradise. The mother was there,\n",
      "spreading her wings like a fan over her brood; the father fluttered\n",
      "about, flew away, then came back, bearing in his beak food and kisses.\n",
      "The dawning day gilded this happy thing, the great law, “Multiply,” lay\n",
      "there smiling and august, and that sweet mystery unfolded in the glory\n",
      "of the morning. Cosette, with her hair in the sunlight, her soul\n",
      "absorbed in chimæras, illuminated by love within and by the dawn\n",
      "without, bent over mechanically, and almost without daring to avow to\n",
      "herself that she was thinking at the same time of Marius, began to gaze\n",
      "at these birds, at this family, at that male and female, that mother\n",

      "without committing great ravages, to tell the truth. The top alone of\n",

      "In the chaos of sentiments and passions which defend a barricade, there\n",

      "\n",
      "“Listen,” suddenly cried Enjolras, who was still on the watch, “it\n",
      "seems to me that Paris is waking up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is certain that, on the morning of the 6th of June, the insurrection\n",
      "broke out afresh for an hour or two, to a certain extent. The obstinacy\n",
      "of the alarm peal of Saint-Merry reanimated some fancies. Barricades\n",
      "were begun in the Rue du Poirier and the Rue des Gravilliers. In front\n",
      "of the Porte Saint-Martin, a young man, armed with a rifle, attacked\n",
      "alone a squadron of cavalry. In plain sight, on the open boulevard, he\n",
      "placed one knee on the ground, shouldered his weapon, fired, killed the\n",

      "who will do us no more harm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He was put to the sword. In the Rue Saint-Denis, a woman fired on the\n",
      "National Guard from behind a lowered blind. The slats of the blind\n",
      "could be seen to tremble at every shot. A child fourteen years of age\n",
      "was arrested in the Rue de la Cossonerie, with his pockets full of\n",
      "cartridges. Many posts were attacked. At the entrance to the Rue\n",
      "Bertin-Poirée, a very lively and utterly unexpected fusillade welcomed\n",
      "a regiment of cuirrassiers, at whose head marched Marshal General\n",
      "Cavaignac de Barague. In the Rue Planche-Mibray, they threw old pieces\n",
      "of pottery and household utensils down on the soldiers from the roofs;\n",
      "a bad sign; and when this matter was reported to Marshal Soult,\n",

      "Saint-Merry until these sparks had been extinguished, in order that\n",
      "they might have to deal with the barricades only and be able to finish\n",

      "fermentation, sweeping the large, sounding the small, right and left,\n",
      "now slowly and cautiously, now at full charge. The troops broke in the\n",
      "doors of houses whence shots had been fired; at the same time,\n",

      "repression was not effected without some commotion, and without that\n",
      "tumultuous uproar peculiar to collisions between the army and the\n",

      "the capers that mesdames our grisettes play on us. Roland gets himself\n",
      "killed for Angélique; all our heroism comes from our women. A man\n",

      "\n",
      "The piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high, and the aim\n",

      "which has fallen into a mountain gorge between two peaked escarpments\n",

      "of lofty houses. It rose gradually and was incessantly renewed; hence a\n",
      "twilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale. The combatants\n",
      "could hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other,\n",
      "short as it was.\n",

      "\n",
      "Beneath the folds of this veil of smoke, and thanks to his small size,\n",
      "he could advance tolerably far into the street without being seen. He\n",
      "rifled the first seven or eight cartridge-boxes without much danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "He crawled flat on his belly, galloped on all fours, took his basket in\n",
      "his teeth, twisted, glided, undulated, wound from one dead body to\n",
      "another, and emptied the cartridge-box or cartouche as a monkey opens a\n",
      "nut.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not dare to shout to him to return from the barricade, which\n",
      "was quite near, for fear of attracting attention to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one body, that of a corporal, he found a powder-flask.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For thirst,” said he, putting it in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "By dint of advancing, he reached a point where the fog of the fusillade\n",
      "became transparent. So that the sharpshooters of the line ranged on the\n",
      "outlook behind their paving-stone dike and the sharpshooters of the\n",
      "banlieue massed at the corner of the street suddenly pointed out to\n",
      "each other something moving through the smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment when Gavroche was relieving a sergeant, who was lying\n",
      "near a stone door-post, of his cartridges, a bullet struck the body.\n",

      "\n",
      "He sprang to his feet, stood erect, with his hair flying in the wind,\n",
      "his hands on his hips, his eyes fixed on the National Guardsmen who\n",
      "were firing, and sang:\n",
      "\n",
      "“On est laid à Nanterre,\n",

      "from it, without missing a single one, and, advancing towards the\n",

      "with a couplet. They aimed at him constantly, and always missed him.\n",
      "The National Guardsmen and the soldiers laughed as they took aim at\n",
      "him. He lay down, sprang to his feet, hid in the corner of a doorway,\n",
      "then made a bound, disappeared, reappeared, scampered away, returned,\n",
      "replied to the grape-shot with his thumb at his nose, and, all the\n",
      "while, went on pillaging the cartouches, emptying the cartridge-boxes,\n",

      "him with their eyes. The barricade trembled; he sang. He was not a\n",
      "child, he was not a man; he was a strange gamin-fairy. He might have\n",
      "been called the invulnerable dwarf of the fray. The bullets flew after\n",
      "him, he was more nimble than they. He played a fearful game of hide and\n",

      "approached, the urchin administered to it a fillip.\n",
      "\n",

      "cry; but there was something of Antæus in that pygmy; for the gamin to\n",
      "touch the pavement is the same as for the giant to touch the earth;\n",
      "Gavroche had fallen only to rise again; he remained in a sitting\n",
      "posture, a long thread of blood streaked his face, he raised both arms\n",
      "in the air, glanced in the direction whence the shot had come, and\n",

      "At that same moment, in the garden of the Luxembourg,—for the gaze of\n",
      "the drama must be everywhere present,—two children were holding each\n",
      "other by the hand. One might have been seven years old, the other five.\n",
      "The rain having soaked them, they were walking along the paths on the\n",
      "sunny side; the elder was leading the younger; they were pale and\n",
      "ragged; they had the air of wild birds. The smaller of them said: “I am\n",
      "very hungry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The elder, who was already somewhat of a protector, was leading his\n",
      "brother with his left hand and in his right he carried a small stick.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were alone in the garden. The garden was deserted, the gates had\n",
      "been closed by order of the police, on account of the insurrection. The\n",
      "troops who had been bivouacking there had departed for the exigencies\n",
      "of combat.\n",
      "\n",
      "How did those children come there? Perhaps they had escaped from some\n",
      "guard-house which stood ajar; perhaps there was in the vicinity, at the\n",
      "Barrière d’Enfer; or on the Esplanade de l’Observatoire, or in the\n",
      "neighboring carrefour, dominated by the pediment on which could be\n",
      "read: _Invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum_, some mountebank’s booth\n",
      "from which they had fled; perhaps they had, on the preceding evening,\n",
      "escaped the eye of the inspectors of the garden at the hour of closing,\n",
      "and had passed the night in some one of those sentry-boxes where people\n",
      "read the papers? The fact is, they were stray lambs and they seemed\n",
      "free. To be astray and to seem free is to be lost. These poor little\n",
      "creatures were, in fact, lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "These two children were the same over whom Gavroche had been put to\n",
      "some trouble, as the reader will recollect. Children of the\n",
      "Thénardiers, leased out to Magnon, attributed to M. Gillenormand, and\n",
      "now leaves fallen from all these rootless branches, and swept over the\n",
      "ground by the wind. Their clothing, which had been clean in Magnon’s\n",
      "day, and which had served her as a prospectus with M. Gillenormand, had\n",
      "been converted into rags.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as “Abandoned\n",
      "children,” whom the police take note of, collect, mislay and find again\n",
      "on the pavements of Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "It required the disturbance of a day like that to account for these\n",
      "miserable little creatures being in that garden. If the superintendents\n",
      "had caught sight of them, they would have driven such rags forth. Poor\n",
      "little things do not enter public gardens; still, people should reflect\n",
      "that, as children, they have a right to flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "These children were there, thanks to the locked gates. They were there\n",
      "contrary to the regulations. They had slipped into the garden and there\n",
      "they remained. Closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors, oversight is\n",
      "supposed to continue, but it grows slack and reposes; and the\n",
      "inspectors, moved by the public anxiety and more occupied with the\n",
      "outside than the inside, no longer glanced into the garden, and had not\n",
      "seen the two delinquents.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had rained the night before, and even a little in the morning. But\n",
      "in June, showers do not count for much. An hour after a storm, it can\n",
      "hardly be seen that the beautiful blonde day has wept. The earth, in\n",
      "summer, is as quickly dried as the cheek of a child. At that period of\n",
      "the solstice, the light of full noonday is, so to speak, poignant. It\n",
      "takes everything. It applies itself to the earth, and superposes itself\n",
      "with a sort of suction. One would say that the sun was thirsty. A\n",
      "shower is but a glass of water; a rainstorm is instantly drunk up. In\n",
      "the morning everything was dripping, in the afternoon everything is\n",
      "powdered over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain and\n",
      "wiped by the rays of sunlight; it is warm freshness. The gardens and\n",
      "meadows, having water at their roots, and sun in their flowers, become\n",
      "perfuming-pans of incense, and smoke with all their odors at once.\n",
      "Everything smiles, sings and offers itself. One feels gently\n",
      "intoxicated. The springtime is a provisional paradise, the sun helps\n",
      "man to have patience.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are beings who demand nothing further; mortals, who, having the\n",
      "azure of heaven, say: “It is enough!” dreamers absorbed in the\n",
      "wonderful, dipping into the idolatry of nature, indifferent to good and\n",
      "evil, contemplators of cosmos and radiantly forgetful of man, who do\n",
      "not understand how people can occupy themselves with the hunger of\n",
      "these, and the thirst of those, with the nudity of the poor in winter,\n",
      "with the lymphatic curvature of the little spinal column, with the\n",
      "pallet, the attic, the dungeon, and the rags of shivering young girls,\n",
      "when they can dream beneath the trees; peaceful and terrible spirits\n",
      "they, and pitilessly satisfied. Strange to say, the infinite suffices\n",
      "them. That great need of man, the finite, which admits of embrace, they\n",
      "ignore. The finite which admits of progress and sublime toil, they do\n",
      "not think about. The indefinite, which is born from the human and\n",
      "divine combination of the infinite and the finite, escapes them.\n",
      "Provided that they are face to face with immensity, they smile. Joy\n",
      "never, ecstasy forever. Their life lies in surrendering their\n",
      "personality in contemplation. The history of humanity is for them only\n",
      "a detailed plan. All is not there; the true All remains without; what\n",
      "is the use of busying oneself over that detail, man? Man suffers, that\n",
      "is quite possible; but look at Aldebaran rising! The mother has no more\n",
      "milk, the new-born babe is dying. I know nothing about that, but just\n",
      "look at this wonderful rosette which a slice of wood-cells of the pine\n",
      "presents under the microscope! Compare the most beautiful Mechlin lace\n",
      "to that if you can! These thinkers forget to love. The zodiac thrives\n",
      "with them to such a point that it prevents their seeing the weeping\n",
      "child. God eclipses their souls. This is a family of minds which are,\n",
      "at once, great and petty. Horace was one of them; so was Goethe. La\n",
      "Fontaine perhaps; magnificent egoists of the infinite, tranquil\n",
      "spectators of sorrow, who do not behold Nero if the weather be fair,\n",
      "for whom the sun conceals the funeral pile, who would look on at an\n",
      "execution by the guillotine in the search for an effect of light, who\n",
      "hear neither the cry nor the sob, nor the death rattle, nor the alarm\n",
      "peal, for whom everything is well, since there is a month of May, who,\n",
      "so long as there are clouds of purple and gold above their heads,\n",
      "declare themselves content, and who are determined to be happy until\n",
      "the radiance of the stars and the songs of the birds are exhausted.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are dark radiances. They have no suspicion that they are to be\n",
      "pitied. Certainly they are so. He who does not weep does not see. They\n",
      "are to be admired and pitied, as one would both pity and admire a being\n",
      "at once night and day, without eyes beneath his lashes but with a star\n",
      "on his brow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The indifference of these thinkers, is, according to some, a superior\n",
      "philosophy. That may be; but in this superiority there is some\n",
      "infirmity. One may be immortal and yet limp: witness Vulcan. One may be\n",
      "more than man and less than man. There is incomplete immensity in\n",
      "nature. Who knows whether the sun is not a blind man?\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, what? In whom can we trust? _Solem quis dicere falsum\n",
      "audeat?_ Who shall dare to say that the sun is false? Thus certain\n",
      "geniuses, themselves, certain Very-Lofty mortals, man-stars, may be\n",
      "mistaken? That which is on high at the summit, at the crest, at the\n",
      "zenith, that which sends down so much light on the earth, sees but\n",
      "little, sees badly, sees not at all? Is not this a desperate state of\n",
      "things? No. But what is there, then, above the sun? The god.\n",

      "On the 6th of June, 1832, about eleven o’clock in the morning, the\n",
      "Luxembourg, solitary and depopulated, was charming. The quincunxes and\n",
      "flower-beds shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight. The\n",
      "branches, wild with the brilliant glow of midday, seemed endeavoring to\n",
      "embrace. In the sycamores there was an uproar of linnets, sparrows\n",
      "triumphed, woodpeckers climbed along the chestnut trees, administering\n",
      "little pecks on the bark. The flower-beds accepted the legitimate\n",
      "royalty of the lilies; the most august of perfumes is that which\n",
      "emanates from whiteness. The peppery odor of the carnations was\n",
      "perceptible. The old crows of Marie de Medici were amorous in the tall\n",
      "trees. The sun gilded, empurpled, set fire to and lighted up the\n",
      "tulips, which are nothing but all the varieties of flame made into\n",
      "flowers. All around the banks of tulips the bees, the sparks of these\n",
      "flame-flowers, hummed. All was grace and gayety, even the impending\n",
      "rain; this relapse, by which the lilies of the valley and the\n",
      "honeysuckles were destined to profit, had nothing disturbing about it;\n",
      "the swallows indulged in the charming threat of flying low. He who was\n",
      "there aspired to happiness; life smelled good; all nature exhaled\n",
      "candor, help, assistance, paternity, caress, dawn. The thoughts which\n",
      "fell from heaven were as sweet as the tiny hand of a baby when one\n",
      "kisses it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The statues under the trees, white and nude, had robes of shadow\n",
      "pierced with light; these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight;\n",
      "rays hung from them on all sides. Around the great fountain, the earth\n",
      "was already dried up to the point of being burnt. There was sufficient\n",
      "breeze to raise little insurrections of dust here and there. A few\n",
      "yellow leaves, left over from the autumn, chased each other merrily,\n",
      "and seemed to be playing tricks on each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "This abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring about\n",
      "it. Life, sap, heat, odors overflowed; one was conscious, beneath\n",
      "creation, of the enormous size of the source; in all these breaths\n",
      "permeated with love, in this interchange of reverberations and\n",
      "reflections, in this marvellous expenditure of rays, in this infinite\n",
      "outpouring of liquid gold, one felt the prodigality of the\n",
      "inexhaustible; and, behind this splendor as behind a curtain of flame,\n",
      "one caught a glimpse of God, that millionaire of stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the sand, there was not a speck of mud; thanks to the rain,\n",
      "there was not a grain of ashes. The clumps of blossoms had just been\n",
      "bathed; every sort of velvet, satin, gold and varnish, which springs\n",
      "from the earth in the form of flowers, was irreproachable. This\n",
      "magnificence was cleanly. The grand silence of happy nature filled the\n",
      "garden. A celestial silence that is compatible with a thousand sorts of\n",
      "music, the cooing of nests, the buzzing of swarms, the flutterings of\n",
      "the breeze. All the harmony of the season was complete in one gracious\n",
      "whole; the entrances and exits of spring took place in proper order;\n",
      "the lilacs ended; the jasmines began; some flowers were tardy, some\n",
      "insects in advance of their time; the van-guard of the red June\n",
      "butterflies fraternized with the rear-guard of the white butterflies of\n",
      "May. The plantain trees were getting their new skins. The breeze\n",
      "hollowed out undulations in the magnificent enormity of the\n",
      "chestnut-trees. It was splendid. A veteran from the neighboring\n",
      "barracks, who was gazing through the fence, said: “Here is the Spring\n",
      "presenting arms and in full uniform.”\n",

      "All nature was breakfasting; creation was at table; this was its hour;\n",
      "the great blue cloth was spread in the sky, and the great green cloth\n",
      "on earth; the sun lighted it all up brilliantly. God was serving the\n",
      "universal repast. Each creature had his pasture or his mess. The\n",
      "ring-dove found his hemp-seed, the chaffinch found his millet, the\n",
      "goldfinch found chickweed, the red-breast found worms, the green finch\n",
      "found flies, the fly found infusoriæ, the bee found flowers. They ate\n",
      "each other somewhat, it is true, which is the misery of evil mixed with\n",
      "good; but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity of the\n",
      "grand fountain, and, rather bewildered by all this light, they tried to\n",
      "hide themselves, the instinct of the poor and the weak in the presence\n",
      "of even impersonal magnificence; and they kept behind the swans’ hutch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here and there, at intervals, when the wind blew, shouts, clamor, a\n",
      "sort of tumultuous death rattle, which was the firing, and dull blows,\n",
      "which were discharges of cannon, struck the ear confusedly. Smoke hung\n",
      "over the roofs in the direction of the Halles. A bell, which had the\n",
      "air of an appeal, was ringing in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "These children did not appear to notice these noises. The little one\n",
      "repeated from time to time: “I am hungry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost at the same instant with the children, another couple approached\n",
      "the great basin. They consisted of a goodman, about fifty years of age,\n",
      "who was leading by the hand a little fellow of six. No doubt, a father\n",
      "and his son. The little man of six had a big brioche.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that epoch, certain houses abutting on the river, in the Rues Madame\n",
      "and d’Enfer, had keys to the Luxembourg garden, of which the lodgers\n",
      "enjoyed the use when the gates were shut, a privilege which was\n",
      "suppressed later on. This father and son came from one of these houses,\n",
      "no doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two poor little creatures watched “that gentleman” approaching, and\n",
      "hid themselves a little more thoroughly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a bourgeois. The same person, perhaps, whom Marius had one day\n",
      "heard, through his love fever, near the same grand basin, counselling\n",
      "his son “to avoid excesses.” He had an affable and haughty air, and a\n",
      "mouth which was always smiling, since it did not shut. This mechanical\n",
      "smile, produced by too much jaw and too little skin, shows the teeth\n",
      "rather than the soul. The child, with his brioche, which he had bitten\n",
      "into but had not finished eating, seemed satiated. The child was\n",
      "dressed as a National Guardsman, owing to the insurrection, and the\n",
      "father had remained clad as a bourgeois out of prudence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Father and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting.\n",
      "This bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration for the swans.\n",
      "He resembled them in this sense, that he walked like them.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the moment, the swans were swimming, which is their principal\n",
      "talent, and they were superb.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the two poor little beings had listened and if they had been of an\n",
      "age to understand, they might have gathered the words of this grave\n",
      "man. The father was saying to his son:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The sage lives content with little. Look at me, my son. I do not love\n",
      "pomp. I am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace and stones; I\n",
      "leave that false splendor to badly organized souls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the Halles\n",
      "burst out with fresh force of bell and uproar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that?” inquired the child.\n",
      "\n",
      "The father replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is the Saturnalia.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once, he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind the\n",
      "green swan-hutch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is the beginning,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, after a pause, he added:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anarchy is entering this garden.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile, his son took a bite of his brioche, spit it out, and,\n",
      "suddenly burst out crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are you crying about?” demanded his father.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not hungry any more,” said the child.\n",
      "\n",
      "The father’s smile became more accentuated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One does not need to be hungry in order to eat a cake.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“My cake tires me. It is stale.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you want any more of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The father pointed to the swans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Throw it to those palmipeds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The child hesitated. A person may not want any more of his cake; but\n",
      "that is no reason for giving it away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The father went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be humane. You must have compassion on animals.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And, taking the cake from his son, he flung it into the basin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cake fell very near the edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The swans were far away, in the centre of the basin, and busy with some\n",
      "prey. They had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bourgeois, feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted, and\n",
      "moved by this useless shipwreck, entered upon a telegraphic agitation,\n",
      "which finally attracted the attention of the swans.\n",
      "\n",
      "They perceived something floating, steered for the edge like ships, as\n",
      "they are, and slowly directed their course toward the brioche, with the\n",
      "stupid majesty which befits white creatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The swans [_cygnes_] understand signs [_signes_],” said the bourgeois,\n",
      "delighted to make a jest.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, the distant tumult of the city underwent another sudden\n",
      "increase. This time it was sinister. There are some gusts of wind which\n",
      "speak more distinctly than others. The one which was blowing at that\n",
      "moment brought clearly defined drum-beats, clamors, platoon firing, and\n",
      "the dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon. This coincided with a\n",
      "black cloud which suddenly veiled the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "The swans had not yet reached the brioche.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us return home,” said the father, “they are attacking the\n",
      "Tuileries.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He grasped his son’s hand again. Then he continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "“From the Tuileries to the Luxembourg, there is but the distance which\n",
      "separates Royalty from the peerage; that is not far. Shots will soon\n",
      "rain down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He glanced at the cloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps it is rain itself that is about to shower down; the sky is\n",
      "joining in; the younger branch is condemned. Let us return home\n",
      "quickly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like to see the swans eat the brioche,” said the child.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“That would be imprudent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he led his little bourgeois away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The son, regretting the swans, turned his head back toward the basin\n",
      "until a corner of the quincunxes concealed it from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile, the two little waifs had approached the brioche at\n",
      "the same time as the swans. It was floating on the water. The smaller\n",
      "of them stared at the cake, the elder gazed after the retreating\n",
      "bourgeois.\n",
      "\n",
      "Father and son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads to the grand\n",
      "flight of steps near the clump of trees on the side of the Rue Madame.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they had disappeared from view, the elder child hastily\n",
      "flung himself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb of the basin,\n",

      "menacing, and, from menacing, was probably about to become desperate.\n",
      "In proportion as the situation grew gloomy, the glow of heroism\n",

      "impossible. In less than a minute, two thirds of the stones which\n",
      "Enjolras had had piled up at the door of Corinthe had been carried up\n",

      "attacked its elder branch in Charles X.; and that which they wished to\n",

      "\n",
      "Thus it is. And we sacrifice ourselves for these visions, which are\n",
      "almost always illusions for the sacrificed, but illusions with which,\n",
      "after all, the whole of human certainty is mingled. We throw ourselves\n",
